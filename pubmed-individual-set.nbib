TI  - Vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections: systematic 
      review and meta-analysis of individual participant data.

AB  - Objectives To assess the overall effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of 
      acute respiratory tract infection, and to identify factors modifying this 
      effect.Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data 
      (IPD) from randomised controlled trials.Data sources Medline, Embase, the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the 
      International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry from inception 
      to December 2015.Eligibility criteria for study selection Randomised, double blind, 
      placebo controlled trials of supplementation with vitamin D(3) or vitamin D(2) of 
      any duration were eligible for inclusion if they had been approved by a research 
      ethics committee and if data on incidence of acute respiratory tract infection were 
      collected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy outcome.Results 25 eligible 
      randomised controlled trials (total 11 321 participants, aged 0 to 95 years) were 
      identified. IPD were obtained for 10 933 (96.6%) participants. Vitamin D 
      supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory tract infection among all 
      participants (adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.96; P for 
      heterogeneity <0.001). In subgroup analysis, protective effects were seen in those 
      receiving daily or weekly vitamin D without additional bolus doses (adjusted odds 
      ratio 0.81, 0.72 to 0.91) but not in those receiving one or more bolus doses 
      (adjusted odds ratio 0.97, 0.86 to 1.10; P for interaction=0.05). Among those 
      receiving daily or weekly vitamin D, protective effects were stronger in those with 
      baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <25 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.30, 0.17 to 
      0.53) than in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels ≥25 nmol/L (adjusted 
      odds ratio 0.75, 0.60 to 0.95; P for interaction=0.006). Vitamin D did not influence 
      the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event 
      (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 0.80 to 1.20, P=0.83). The body of evidence contributing 
      to these analyses was assessed as being of high quality.Conclusions Vitamin D 
      supplementation was safe and it protected against acute respiratory tract infection 
      overall. Patients who were very vitamin D deficient and those not receiving bolus 
      doses experienced the most benefit.Systematic review registration PROSPERO

TI  - Endovascular thrombectomy after large-vessel ischaemic stroke: a meta-analysis of 
      individual patient data from five randomised trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2015, five randomised trials showed efficacy of endovascular 
      thrombectomy over standard medical care in patients with acute ischaemic stroke 
      caused by occlusion of arteries of the proximal anterior circulation. In this 
      meta-analysis we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool individual patient data 
      from these trials to address remaining questions about whether the therapy is 
      efficacious across the diverse populations included. METHODS: We formed the HERMES 
      collaboration to pool patient-level data from five trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, 
      REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, and EXTEND IA) done between December, 2010, and December, 
      2014. In these trials, patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of 
      the proximal anterior artery circulation were randomly assigned to receive either 
      endovascular thrombectomy within 12 h of symptom onset or standard care (control), 
      with a primary outcome of reduced disability on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 
      90 days. By direct access to the study databases, we extracted individual patient 
      data that we used to assess the primary outcome of reduced disability on mRS at 90 
      days in the pooled population and examine heterogeneity of this treatment effect 
      across prespecified subgroups. To account for between-trial variance we used 
      mixed-effects modelling with random effects for parameters of interest. We then used 
      mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression models to calculate common odds ratios 
      (cOR) for the primary outcome in the whole population (shift analysis) and in 
      subgroups after adjustment for age, sex, baseline stroke severity (National 
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score), site of occlusion (internal carotid artery 
      vs M1 segment of middle cerebral artery vs M2 segment of middle cerebral artery), 
      intravenous alteplase (yes vs no), baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, 
      and time from stroke onset to randomisation. FINDINGS: We analysed individual data 
      for 1287 patients (634 assigned to endovascular thrombectomy, 653 assigned to 
      control). Endovascular thrombectomy led to significantly reduced disability at 90 
      days compared with control (adjusted cOR 2.49, 95% CI 1.76-3.53; p<0.0001). The 
      number needed to treat with endovascular thrombectomy to reduce disability by at 
      least one level on mRS for one patient was 2.6. Subgroup analysis of the primary 
      endpoint showed no heterogeneity of treatment effect across prespecified subgroups 
      for reduced disability (pinteraction=0.43). Effect sizes favouring endovascular 
      thrombectomy over control were present in several strata of special interest, 
      including in patients aged 80 years or older (cOR 3.68, 95% CI 1.95-6.92), those 
      randomised more than 300 min after symptom onset (1.76, 1.05-2.97), and those not 
      eligible for intravenous alteplase (2.43, 1.30-4.55). Mortality at 90 days and risk 
      of parenchymal haematoma and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage did not differ 
      between populations. INTERPRETATION: Endovascular thrombectomy is of benefit to most 
      patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of the proximal anterior 
      circulation, irrespective of patient characteristics or geographical location. These 
      findings will have global implications on structuring systems of care to provide 
      timely treatment to patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel 
      occlusion. FUNDING: Medtronic.

TI  - Acupuncture for Chronic Pain: Update of an Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis.

AB  - Despite wide use in clinical practice, acupuncture remains a controversial treatment 
      for chronic pain. Our objective was to update an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis to determine the effect size of acupuncture for 4 chronic pain 
      conditions. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled 
      Trials randomized trials published up until December 31, 2015. We included 
      randomized trials of acupuncture needling versus either sham acupuncture or no 
      acupuncture control for nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis, chronic 
      headache, or shoulder pain. Trials were only included if allocation concealment was 
      unambiguously determined to be adequate. Raw data were obtained from study authors 
      and entered into an individual patient data meta-analysis. The main outcome measures 
      were pain and function. An additional 13 trials were identified, with data received 
      for a total of 20,827 patients from 39 trials. Acupuncture was superior to sham as 
      well as no acupuncture control for each pain condition (all P < .001) with 
      differences between groups close to .5 SDs compared with no acupuncture control and 
      close to .2 SDs compared with sham. We also found clear evidence that the effects of 
      acupuncture persist over time with only a small decrease, approximately 15%, in 
      treatment effect at 1 year. In secondary analyses, we found no obvious association 
      between trial outcome and characteristics of acupuncture treatment, but effect sizes 
      of acupuncture were associated with the type of control group, with smaller effects 
      sizes for sham controlled trials that used a penetrating needle for sham, and for 
      trials that had high intensity of intervention in the control arm. We conclude that 
      acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain, with treatment effects 
      persisting over time. Although factors in addition to the specific effects of 
      needling at correct acupuncture point locations are important contributors to the 
      treatment effect, decreases in pain after acupuncture cannot be explained solely in 
      terms of placebo effects. Variations in the effect size of acupuncture in different 
      trials are driven predominantly by differences in treatments received by the control 
      group rather than by differences in the characteristics of acupuncture treatment. 
      PERSPECTIVE: Acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal, 
      headache, and osteoarthritis pain. Treatment effects of acupuncture persist over 
      time and cannot be explained solely in terms of placebo effects. Referral for a 
      course of acupuncture treatment is a reasonable option for a patient with chronic 
      pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study serious harms associated with selective serotonin and 
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.Design Systematic review and 
      meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality and suicidality. Secondary outcomes 
      were aggressive behaviour and akathisia. DATA SOURCES: Clinical study reports for 
      duloxetine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine obtained from the 
      European and UK drug regulators, and summary trial reports for duloxetine and 
      fluoxetine from Eli Lilly's website. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION: 
      Double blind placebo controlled trials that contained any patient narratives or 
      individual patient listings of harms. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two researchers 
      extracted data independently; the outcomes were meta-analysed by Peto's exact method 
      (fixed effect model). RESULTS: We included 70 trials (64,381 pages of clinical study 
      reports) with 18,526 patients. These trials had limitations in the study design and 
      discrepancies in reporting, which may have led to serious under-reporting of harms. 
      For example, some outcomes appeared only in individual patient listings in 
      appendices, which we had for only 32 trials, and we did not have case report forms 
      for any of the trials. Differences in mortality (all deaths were in adults, odds 
      ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 4.06), suicidality (1.21, 0.84 to 1.74), 
      and akathisia (2.04, 0.93 to 4.48) were not significant, whereas patients taking 
      antidepressants displayed more aggressive behaviour (1.93, 1.26 to 2.95). For 
      adults, the odds ratios were 0.81 (0.51 to 1.28) for suicidality, 1.09 (0.55 to 
      2.14) for aggression, and 2.00 (0.79 to 5.04) for akathisia. The corresponding 
      values for children and adolescents were 2.39 (1.31 to 4.33), 2.79 (1.62 to 4.81), 
      and 2.15 (0.48 to 9.65). In the summary trial reports on Eli Lilly's website, almost 
      all deaths were noted, but all suicidal ideation events were missing, and the 
      information on the remaining outcomes was incomplete. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the 
      shortcomings identified and having only partial access to appendices with no access 
      to case report forms, the harms could not be estimated accurately. In adults there 
      was no significant increase in all four outcomes, but in children and adolescents 
      the risk of suicidality and aggression doubled. To elucidate the harms reliably, 
      access to anonymised individual patient data is needed.

TI  - Comparison of Antibiotic Therapy and Appendectomy for Acute Uncomplicated 
      Appendicitis in Children: A Meta-analysis.
PG  - 426-434
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.0057 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Antibiotic therapy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis is effective in 
      adult patients, but its application in pediatric patients remains controversial. 
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of antibiotic treatment vs 
      appendectomy as the primary therapy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in 
      pediatric patients. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library 
      databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for randomized clinical trials 
      were searched through April 17, 2016. The search was limited to studies published in 
      English. Search terms included appendicitis, antibiotics, appendectomy, randomized 
      controlled trial, controlled clinical trial, randomized, placebo, drug therapy, 
      randomly, and trial. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials and prospective 
      clinical controlled trials comparing antibiotic therapy with appendectomy for acute 
      uncomplicated appendicitis in pediatric patients (aged 5-18 years) were included in 
      the meta-analysis. The outcomes included at least 2 of the following terms: success 
      rate of antibiotic treatment and appendectomy, complications, readmissions, length 
      of stay, total cost, and disability days. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were 
      independently extracted by 2 reviewers. The quality of the included studies was 
      examined in accordance with the Cochrane guidelines and the Newcastle-Ottawa 
      criteria. Data were pooled using a logistic fixed-effects model, and the subgroup 
      pooled risk ratio with or without appendicolith was estimated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary outcome was the success rate of treatment. The hypothesis was 
      formulated before data collection. RESULTS: A total of 527 articles were screened. 
      In 5 unique studies, 404 unique patients with uncomplicated appendicitis (aged 5-15 
      years) were enrolled. Nonoperative treatment was successful in 152 of 168 patients 
      (90.5%), with a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects risk ratio of 8.92 (95% CI, 
      2.67-29.79; heterogeneity, P = .99; I2 = 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that the risk 
      for treatment failure in patients with appendicolith increased, with a 
      Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects risk ratio of 10.43 (95% CI, 1.46-74.26; 
      heterogeneity, P = .91; I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis 
      shows that antibiotics as the initial treatment for pediatric patients with 
      uncomplicated appendicitis may be feasible and effective without increasing the risk 
      for complications. However, the failure rate, mainly caused by the presence of 
      appendicolith, is higher than for appendectomy. Surgery is preferably suggested for 
      uncomplicated appendicitis with appendicolith.

TI  - Extending thrombolysis to 4·5-9 h and wake-up stroke using perfusion imaging: a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data.
PG  - 139-147

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke thrombolysis with alteplase is currently recommended 0-4·5 h 
      after stroke onset. We aimed to determine whether perfusion imaging can identify 
      patients with salvageable brain tissue with symptoms 4·5 h or more from stroke onset 
      or with symptoms on waking who might benefit from thrombolysis. METHODS: In this 
      systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data, we searched PubMed 
      for randomised trials published in English between Jan 1, 2006, and March 1, 2019. 
      We also reviewed the reference list of a previous systematic review of thrombolysis 
      and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for interventional studies of ischaemic stroke. 
      Studies of alteplase versus placebo in patients (aged ≥18 years) with ischaemic 
      stroke treated more than 4·5 h after onset, or with wake-up stroke, who were imaged 
      with perfusion-diffusion MRI or CT perfusion were eligible for inclusion. The 
      primary outcome was excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 
      0-1) at 3 months, adjusted for baseline age and clinical severity. Safety outcomes 
      were death and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. We calculated odds ratios, 
      adjusted for baseline age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 
      using mixed-effects logistic regression models. This study is registered with 
      PROSPERO, number CRD42019128036. FINDINGS: We identified three trials that met 
      eligibility criteria: EXTEND, ECASS4-EXTEND, and EPITHET. Of the 414 patients 
      included in the three trials, 213 (51%) were assigned to receive alteplase and 201 
      (49%) were assigned to receive placebo. Overall, 211 patients in the alteplase group 
      and 199 patients in the placebo group had mRS assessment data at 3 months and thus 
      were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. 76 (36%) of 211 patients in 
      the alteplase group and 58 (29%) of 199 patients in the placebo group had achieved 
      excellent functional outcome at 3 months (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·86, 95% CI 
      1·15-2·99, p=0·011). Symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage was more common in the 
      alteplase group than the placebo group (ten [5%] of 213 patients vs one [<1%] of 201 
      patients in the placebo group; adjusted OR 9·7, 95% CI 1·23-76·55, p=0·031). 29 
      (14%) of 213 patients in the alteplase group and 18 (9%) of 201 patients in the 
      placebo group died (adjusted OR 1·55, 0·81-2·96, p=0·66). INTERPRETATION: Patients 
      with ischaemic stroke 4·5-9 h from stroke onset or wake-up stroke with salvageable 
      brain tissue who were treated with alteplase achieved better functional outcomes 
      than did patients given placebo. The rate of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage 
      was higher with alteplase, but this increase did not negate the overall net benefit 
      of thrombolysis. FUNDING: None.

TI  - Vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory infections: individual 
      participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-44
LID - 10.3310/hta23020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the potential of vitamin D 
      to prevent acute respiratory infections have yielded mixed results. Individual 
      participant data (IPD) meta-analysis has the potential to identify factors that may 
      explain this heterogeneity. OBJECTIVES: To assess the overall effect of vitamin D 
      supplementation on the risk of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and to identify 
      factors modifying this effect. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the 
      International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) registry. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of supplementation 
      with vitamin D(3) or vitamin D(2) of any duration having incidence of acute 
      respiratory infection as a prespecified efficacy outcome were selected. STUDY 
      APPRAISAL: Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias 
      tool to assess sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of 
      participants, personnel and outcome assessors, completeness of outcome data, 
      evidence of selective outcome reporting and other potential threats to validity. 
      RESULTS: We identified 25 eligible RCTs (a total of 11,321 participants, aged from 0 
      to 95 years). IPD were obtained for 10,933 out of 11,321 (96.6%) participants. 
      Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARI among all participants [adjusted 
      odds ratio (aOR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.96; heterogeneity 
      p < 0.001]. Subgroup analysis revealed that protective effects were seen in 
      individuals receiving daily or weekly vitamin D without additional bolus doses (aOR 
      0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.91), but not in those receiving one or more bolus doses (aOR 
      0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.10; p = 0.05). Among those receiving daily or weekly vitamin 
      D, protective effects of vitamin D were stronger in individuals with a baseline 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration of < 25 nmol/l (aOR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 
      0.53) than in those with a baseline 25(OH)D concentration of ≥ 25 nmol/l (aOR 0.75, 
      95% CI 0.60 to 0.95; p = 0.006). Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of 
      participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (aOR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 
      to 1.20; p = 0.83). The body of evidence contributing to these analyses was assessed 
      as being of high quality. LIMITATIONS: Our study had limited power to detect the 
      effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of upper versus lower respiratory 
      infection, analysed separately. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation was safe, and 
      it protected against ARIs overall. Very deficient individuals and those not 
      receiving bolus doses experienced the benefit. Incorporation of additional IPD from 
      ongoing trials in the field has the potential to increase statistical power for 
      analyses of secondary outcomes. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as 
      PROSPERO CRD42014013953. FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health 
      Technology Assessment programme.

TI  - Vaginal progesterone for preventing preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes in 
      singleton gestations with a short cervix: a meta-analysis of individual patient 
      data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of vaginal progesterone for preventing preterm birth and 
      adverse perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with a short cervix has been 
      questioned after publication of the OPPTIMUM study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether 
      vaginal progesterone prevents preterm birth and improves perinatal outcomes in 
      asymptomatic women with a singleton gestation and a midtrimester sonographic short 
      cervix. STUDY DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CINAHL (from their 
      inception to September 2017); Cochrane databases; bibliographies; and conference 
      proceedings for randomized controlled trials comparing vaginal progesterone vs 
      placebo/no treatment in women with a singleton gestation and a midtrimester 
      sonographic cervical length ≤25 mm. This was a systematic review and meta-analysis 
      of individual patient data. The primary outcome was preterm birth <33 weeks of 
      gestation. Secondary outcomes included adverse perinatal outcomes and 
      neurodevelopmental and health outcomes at 2 years of age. Individual patient data 
      were analyzed using a 2-stage approach. Pooled relative risks with 95% confidence 
      intervals were calculated. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE 
      methodology. RESULTS: Data were available from 974 women (498 allocated to vaginal 
      progesterone, 476 allocated to placebo) with a cervical length ≤25 mm participating 
      in 5 high-quality trials. Vaginal progesterone was associated with a significant 
      reduction in the risk of preterm birth <33 weeks of gestation (relative risk, 0.62; 
      95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.81; P = .0006; high-quality evidence). Moreover, 
      vaginal progesterone significantly decreased the risk of preterm birth <36, <35, 
      <34, <32, <30, and <28 weeks of gestation; spontaneous preterm birth <33 and <34 
      weeks of gestation; respiratory distress syndrome; composite neonatal morbidity and 
      mortality; birthweight <1500 and <2500 g; and admission to the neonatal intensive 
      care unit (relative risks from 0.47-0.82; high-quality evidence for all). There were 
      7 (1.4%) neonatal deaths in the vaginal progesterone group and 15 (3.2%) in the 
      placebo group (relative risk, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-1.07; P = .07; 
      low-quality evidence). Maternal adverse events, congenital anomalies, and adverse 
      neurodevelopmental and health outcomes at 2 years of age did not differ between 
      groups. CONCLUSION: Vaginal progesterone decreases the risk of preterm birth and 
      improves perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with a midtrimester sonographic 
      short cervix, without any demonstrable deleterious effects on childhood 
      neurodevelopment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite widespread use, questions remain about the efficacy of 
      oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza. We aimed to do an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis for all clinical trials comparing oseltamivir with placebo for 
      treatment of seasonal influenza in adults regarding symptom alleviation, 
      complications, and safety. METHODS: We included all published and unpublished 
      Roche-sponsored randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of 75 mg twice a 
      day oseltamivir in adults. Trials of oseltamivir for treatment of naturally 
      occurring influenza-like illness in adults reporting at least one of the study 
      outcomes were eligible. We also searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register 
      for other relevant trials published before Jan 1, 2014 (search last updated on Nov 
      27, 2014). We analysed intention-to-treat infected, intention-to-treat, and safety 
      populations. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of all symptoms analysed 
      with accelerated failure time methods. We used risk ratios and Mantel-Haenszel 
      methods to work out complications, admittances to hospital, and safety outcomes. 
      FINDINGS: We included data from nine trials including 4328 patients. In the 
      intention-to-treat infected population, we noted a 21% shorter time to alleviation 
      of all symptoms for oseltamivir versus placebo recipients (time ratio 0·79, 95% CI 
      0·74-0·85; p<0·0001). The median times to alleviation were 97·5 h for oseltamivir 
      and 122·7 h for placebo groups (difference -25·2 h, 95% CI -36·2 to -16·0). For the 
      intention-to-treat population, the estimated treatment effect was attenuated (time 
      ratio 0·85) but remained highly significant (median difference -17·8 h). In the 
      intention-to-treat infected population, we noted fewer lower respiratory tract 
      complications requiring antibiotics more than 48 h after randomisation (risk ratio 
      [RR] 0·56, 95% CI 0·42-0·75; p=0·0001; 4·9% oseltamivir vs 8·7% placebo, risk 
      difference -3·8%, 95% CI -5·0 to -2·2) and also fewer admittances to hospital for 
      any cause (RR 0·37, 95% CI 0·17-0·81; p=0·013; 0·6% oseltamivir, 1·7% placebo, risk 
      difference -1·1%, 95% CI -1·4 to -0·3). Regarding safety, oseltamivir increased the 
      risk of nausea (RR 1·60, 95% CI 1·29-1·99; p<0·0001; 9·9% oseltamivir vs 6·2% 
      placebo, risk difference 3·7%, 95% CI 1·8-6·1) and vomiting (RR 2·43, 95% CI 
      1·83-3·23; p<0·0001; 8·0% oseltamivir vs 3·3% placebo, risk difference 4·7%, 95% CI 
      2·7-7·3). We recorded no effect on neurological or psychiatric disorders or serious 
      adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that oseltamivir in adults with 
      influenza accelerates time to clinical symptom alleviation, reduces risk of lower 
      respiratory tract complications, and admittance to hospital, but increases the 
      occurrence of nausea and vomiting. FUNDING: Multiparty Group for Advice on Science

TI  - Vaginal progesterone is as effective as cervical cerclage to prevent preterm birth 
      in women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a short 
      cervix: updated indirect comparison meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An indirect comparison meta-analysis published in 2013 reported that 
      both vaginal progesterone and cerclage are equally efficacious for preventing 
      preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes in women with a singleton gestation, 
      previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a sonographic short cervix. The efficacy of 
      vaginal progesterone has been challenged after publication of the OPPTIMUM study. 
      However, this has been resolved by an individual patient-data meta-analysis (Am J 
      Obstet Gynecol. 2018;218:161-180). OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of vaginal 
      progesterone and cerclage in preventing preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes 
      in women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a 
      midtrimester sonographic short cervix. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and 
      CINAHL (from their inception to March 2018); Cochrane databases, bibliographies, and 
      conference proceedings. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials 
      comparing vaginal progesterone to placebo/no treatment or cerclage to no cerclage in 
      women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a 
      sonographic cervical length <25 mm. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Updated 
      systematic review and adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis of vaginal 
      progesterone vs cerclage using placebo/no cerclage as the common comparator. The 
      primary outcomes were preterm birth <35 weeks of gestation and perinatal mortality. 
      Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: 
      Five trials comparing vaginal progesterone vs placebo (265 women) and 5 comparing 
      cerclage vs no cerclage (504 women) were included. Vaginal progesterone, compared to 
      placebo, significantly reduced the risk of preterm birth <35 and <32 weeks of 
      gestation, composite perinatal morbidity/mortality, neonatal sepsis, composite 
      neonatal morbidity, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (RRs from 0.29 
      to 0.68). Cerclage, compared to no cerclage, significantly decreased the risk of 
      preterm birth <37, <35, <32, and <28 weeks of gestation, composite perinatal 
      morbidity/mortality, and birthweight <1500 g (RRs from 0.64 to 0.70). Adjusted 
      indirect comparison meta-analyses did not show statistically significant differences 
      between vaginal progesterone and cerclage in the reduction of preterm birth or 
      adverse perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSION: Vaginal progesterone and cerclage are 
      equally effective for preventing preterm birth and improving perinatal outcomes in 
      women with a singleton gestation, previous spontaneous preterm birth, and a 
      midtrimester sonographic short cervix. The choice of treatment will depend on 
      adverse events and cost-effectiveness of interventions and patient/physician's 
      preferences.

TI  - Vitamin D supplementation to prevent asthma exacerbations: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of individual participant data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous aggregate data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials 
      showed that vitamin D supplementation reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations 
      requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Whether this effect is restricted 
      to patients with low baseline vitamin D status is unknown. METHODS: For this 
      systematic review and one-step and two-step meta-analysis of individual participant 
      data, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials, and Web of Science for double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised 
      controlled trials of vitamin D(3) or vitamin D(2) supplementation in people with 
      asthma that reported incidence of asthma exacerbation, published between database 
      inception and Oct 26, 2016. We analysed individual participant data requested from 
      the principal investigator for each eligible trial, adjusting for age and sex, and 
      clustering by study. The primary outcome was the incidence of asthma exacerbation 
      requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Mixed-effects regression models 
      were used to obtain the pooled intervention effect with a 95% CI. Subgroup analyses 
      were done to determine whether effects of vitamin D on risk of asthma exacerbation 
      varied according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration, age, 
      ethnic or racial origin, body-mass index, vitamin D dosing regimen, use of inhaled 
      corticosteroids, or end-study 25(OH)D levels; post-hoc subgroup analyses were done 
      according to sex and study duration. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number 
      CRD42014013953. FINDINGS: Our search identified 483 unique studies, eight of which 
      were eligible randomised controlled trials (total 1078 participants). We sought 
      individual participant data for each and obtained it for seven studies (955 
      participants). Vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma exacerbation 
      requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids among all participants (adjusted 
      incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0·74, 95% CI 0·56-0·97; p=0·03; 955 participants in 
      seven studies; high-quality evidence). There were no significant differences between 
      vitamin D and placebo in the proportion of participants with at least one 
      exacerbation or time to first exacerbation. Subgroup analyses of the rate of asthma 
      exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids revealed that protective effects 
      were seen in participants with baseline 25(OH)D of less than 25 nmol/L (aIRR 0·33, 
      0·11-0·98; p=0·046; 92 participants in three studies; moderate-quality evidence) but 
      not in participants with higher baseline 25(OH)D levels (aIRR 0·77, 0·58-1·03; 
      p=0·08; 764 participants in six studies; moderate-quality evidence; 
      p(interaction)=0·25). p values for interaction for all other subgroup analyses were 
      also higher than 0·05; therefore, we did not show that the effects of this 
      intervention are stronger in any one subgroup than in another. Six studies were 
      assessed as being at low risk of bias, and one was assessed as being at unclear risk 
      of bias. The two-step meta-analysis did not reveal evidence of heterogeneity of 
      effect (I(2)=0·0, p=0·56). INTERPRETATION: Vitamin D supplementation reduced the 
      rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids 
      overall. We did not find definitive evidence that effects of this intervention 
      differed across subgroups of patients. FUNDING: Health Technology Assessment

TI  - Association Between Oxygen Saturation Targeting and Death or Disability in Extremely 
      Preterm Infants in the Neonatal Oxygenation Prospective Meta-analysis Collaboration.
PG  - 2190-2201
LID - 10.1001/jama.2018.5725 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: There are potential benefits and harms of hyperoxemia and hypoxemia for 
      extremely preterm infants receiving more vs less supplemental oxygen. OBJECTIVE: To 
      compare the effects of different target ranges for oxygen saturation as measured by 
      pulse oximetry (Spo2) on death or major morbidity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Prospectively planned meta-analysis of individual participant data 
      from 5 randomized clinical trials (conducted from 2005-2014) enrolling infants born 
      before 28 weeks' gestation. EXPOSURES: Spo2 target range that was lower (85%-89%) vs 
      higher (91%-95%). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of 
      death or major disability (bilateral blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy diagnosed 
      as ≥2 level on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, or Bayley-III 
      cognitive or language score <85) at a corrected age of 18 to 24 months. There were 
      16 secondary outcomes including the components of the primary outcome and other 
      major morbidities. RESULTS: A total of 4965 infants were randomized (2480 to the 
      lower Spo2 target range and 2485 to the higher Spo2 range) and had a median 
      gestational age of 26 weeks (interquartile range, 25-27 weeks) and a mean birth 
      weight of 832 g (SD, 190 g). The primary outcome occurred in 1191 of 2228 infants 
      (53.5%) in the lower Spo2 target group and 1150 of 2229 infants (51.6%) in the 
      higher Spo2 target group (risk difference, 1.7% [95% CI, -1.3% to 4.6%]; relative 
      risk [RR], 1.04 [95% CI, 0.98 to 1.09], P = .21). Of the 16 secondary outcomes, 11 
      were null, 2 significantly favored the lower Spo2 target group, and 3 significantly 
      favored the higher Spo2 target group. Death occurred in 484 of 2433 infants (19.9%) 
      in the lower Spo2 target group and 418 of 2440 infants (17.1%) in the higher Spo2 
      target group (risk difference, 2.8% [95% CI, 0.6% to 5.0%]; RR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.04 
      to 1.31], P = .01). Treatment for retinopathy of prematurity was administered to 220 
      of 2020 infants (10.9%) in the lower Spo2 target group and 308 of 2065 infants 
      (14.9%) in the higher Spo2 target group (risk difference, -4.0% [95% CI, -6.1% to 
      -2.0%]; RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.86], P < .001). Severe necrotizing enterocolitis 
      occurred in 227 of 2464 infants (9.2%) in the lower Spo2 target group and 170 of 
      2465 infants (6.9%) in the higher Spo2 target group (risk difference, 2.3% [95% CI, 
      0.8% to 3.8%]; RR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.10 to 1.61], P = .003). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this prospectively planned meta-analysis of individual participant 
      data from extremely preterm infants, there was no significant difference between a 
      lower Spo2 target range compared with a higher Spo2 target range on the primary 
      composite outcome of death or major disability at a corrected age of 18 to 24 
      months. The lower Spo2 target range was associated with a higher risk of death and 
      necrotizing enterocolitis, but a lower risk of retinopathy of prematurity treatment.

AB  - There is uncertainty regarding how long the effects of acupuncture treatment persist 
      after a course of treatment. We aimed to determine the trajectory of pain scores 
      over time after acupuncture, using a large individual patient data set from 
      high-quality randomized trials of acupuncture for chronic pain. The available 
      individual patient data set included 29 trials and 17,922 patients. The chronic pain 
      conditions included musculoskeletal pain (low back, neck, and shoulder), 
      osteoarthritis of the knee, and headache/migraine. We used meta-analytic techniques 
      to determine the trajectory of posttreatment pain scores. Data on longer term 
      follow-up were available for 20 trials, including 6376 patients. In trials comparing 
      acupuncture to no acupuncture control (wait-list, usual care, etc), effect sizes 
      diminished by a nonsignificant 0.011 SD per 3 months (95% confidence interval: 
      -0.014 to 0.037, P = 0.4) after treatment ended. The central estimate suggests that 
      approximately 90% of the benefit of acupuncture relative to controls would be 
      sustained at 12 months. For trials comparing acupuncture to sham, we observed a 
      reduction in effect size of 0.025 SD per 3 months (95% confidence interval: 
      0.000-0.050, P = 0.050), suggesting approximately a 50% diminution at 12 months. The 
      effects of a course of acupuncture treatment for patients with chronic pain do not 
      seem to decrease importantly over 12 months. Patients can generally be reassured 
      that treatment effects persist. Studies of the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture 
      should take our findings into account when considering the time horizon of 
      acupuncture effects. Further research should measure longer term outcomes of 
      acupuncture.

TI  - Delayed vs early umbilical cord clamping for preterm infants: a systematic review 
      and meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of delayed cord clamping of the umbilical cord in preterm 
      infants are unclear. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the effects of delayed vs early 
      cord clamping on hospital mortality (primary outcome) and morbidity in preterm 
      infants using Cochrane Collaboration neonatal review group methodology. STUDY 
      DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
      and Chinese articles, cross-referencing citations, expert informants, and trial 
      registries to July 31, 2017, for randomized controlled trials of delayed (≥30 
      seconds) vs early (<30 seconds) clamping in infants born <37 weeks' gestation. 
      Before searching the literature, we specified that trials estimated to have cord 
      milking in >20% of infants in any arm would be ineligible. Two reviewers 
      independently selected studies, assessed bias, and extracted data. Relative risk 
      (ie, risk ratio), risk difference, and mean difference with 95% confidence intervals 
      were assessed by fixed effects models, heterogeneity by I(2) statistics, and the 
      quality of evidence by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and 
      Evaluations. RESULTS: Eighteen randomized controlled trials compared delayed vs 
      early clamping in 2834 infants. Most infants allocated to have delayed clamping were 
      assigned a delay of ≥60 seconds. Delayed clamping reduced hospital mortality (risk 
      ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.90; risk difference, -0.03; 95% 
      confidence interval, -0.05 to -0.01; P = .005; number needed to benefit, 33; 95% 
      confidence interval, 20-100; Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, 
      and Evaluations = high, with I(2) = 0 indicating no heterogeneity). In 3 trials in 
      996 infants ≤28 weeks' gestation, delayed clamping reduced hospital mortality (risk 
      ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.95; risk difference, -0.05; 95% 
      confidence interval, -0.09 to -0.01; P = .02, number needed to benefit, 20; 95% 
      confidence interval, 11-100; I(2) = 0). In subgroup analyses, delayed clamping 
      reduced the incidence of low Apgar score at 1 minute, but not at 5 minutes, and did 
      not reduce the incidence of intubation for resuscitation, admission temperature, 
      mechanical ventilation, intraventricular hemorrhage, brain injury, chronic lung 
      disease, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, late onset sepsis or 
      retinopathy of prematurity. Delayed clamping increased peak hematocrit by 2.73 
      percentage points (95% confidence interval, 1.94-3.52; P < .00001) and reduced the 
      proportion of infants having blood transfusion by 10% (95% confidence interval, 
      6-13%; P < .00001). Potential harms of delayed clamping included polycythemia and 
      hyperbilirubinemia. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides high-quality 
      evidence that delayed clamping reduced hospital mortality, which supports current 
      guidelines recommending delayed clamping in preterm infants. This review does not 
      evaluate cord milking, which may also be of benefit. Analyses of individual patient 
      data in these and other randomized controlled trials will be critically important in 
      reliably evaluating important secondary outcomes.

TI  - Prolonged glucocorticoid treatment is associated with improved ARDS outcomes: 
      analysis of individual patients' data from four randomized trials and trial-level 
      meta-analysis of the updated literature.
PG  - 829-840
LID - 10.1007/s00134-015-4095-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of prolonged glucocorticoid treatment for 
      patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: We conducted two 
      sets of intention-to-treat analyses: (1) a primary analysis of individual patients' 
      data (IPD) of four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated 
      methylprednisolone treatment (n = 322) and (2) a trial-level meta-analysis 
      incorporating four additional RCTs which investigated hydrocortisone treatment in 
      early ARDS (n = 297). We standardized definitions to derive outcomes in all 
      datasets. The primary outcome for the IPD analysis was time to achieving unassisted 
      breathing (UAB) by study day 28. Secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation 
      (MV) and intensive care unit (ICU)-free days, hospital mortality, and time to 
      hospital mortality by day 28. RESULTS: By study day 28, compared to the placebo 
      group, the methylprednisolone group had fewer patients who died before achieving UAB 
      (12 vs. 29 %; p < 0.001) and more patients who achieved UAB (80 vs. 50 %; 
      p < 0.001). In the methylprednisolone group, time to achieving UAB was shorter 
      [hazard ratio 2.59, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.95-3.43; p < 0.001], and 
      hospital mortality was decreased (20 vs. 33 %; p = 0.006), leading to increased MV 
      (13.3 ± 11.8 vs. 7.6 ± 5.7; p < 0.001) and ICU-free days (10.8 ± 0.71 vs. 
      6.4 ± 0.85; p < 0.001). In those patients randomized before day 14 of ARDS onset, 
      the trial-level meta-analysis indicated decreased hospital mortality (36 vs. 49 %; 
      risk ratio 0.76, 95 % CI 0.59-0.98, I (2) = 17 %, p = 0.035; moderate certainty). 
      Treatment was not associated with increased risk for infections (risk ratio 0.77, 
      95 % CI 0.56-1.08, I (2) = 26 %; p = 0.13; moderate certainty). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Prolonged methylprednisolone treatment accelerates the resolution of ARDS, improving 
      a broad spectrum of interrelated clinical outcomes and decreasing hospital mortality 
      and healthcare utilization.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and tolerability of new-generation antidepressants for major 
      depressive disorder in children and adolescents: protocol of an individual patient 
      data meta-analysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although previous conventional meta-analyses and network meta-analyses 
      have provided some important findings about pharmacological treatments for children 
      and adolescents with depressive disorders in the past decades, several questions 
      still remain unsolved by the aggregate data from those meta-analyses. Individual 
      participant data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) enables exploration of the impacts of 
      individual characteristics on treatment effects, allowing matching of treatments to 
      specific subgroups of patients. We will perform an IPD-MA to assess the efficacy and 
      tolerability of new-generation antidepressants for major depressive disorder in 
      children and adolescents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will systematically search for 
      all double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have compared any 
      new-generation antidepressant with placebo for the acute treatment of major 
      depressive disorder in children and adolescents, in the following databases: PubMed, 
      EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, LILACS and ProQuest 
      Dissertations. We will contact all corresponding authors of included RCTs and ask 
      for their cooperation in this project by providing individual participant data from 
      the original trials. The primary outcomes will include efficacy, measured as the 
      mean change of depression symptoms by Children's Depression Rating Scale Revised 
      (CDRS-R), and tolerability, measured as the proportion of patients who withdrew from 
      the trials early due to adverse effects. The secondary outcomes will include 
      response rates, remission rates, deterioration rate, all-cause discontinuation, 
      suicidal-related outcomes and global functioning outcome. Using the raw 
      de-identified study data, we will use mixed-effects logistic and linear regression 
      models to perform the IPD-MAs. The risk of bias of included studies will be assessed 
      using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We will also detect the publication bias and 
      effects of non-participation of eligible studies. DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is 
      not required given that informed consent has already been obtained from the patients 
      by the trial investigators before the included trials were conducted. This study may 
      have considerable implications for practice and help improve patient care. PROSPERO

TI  - Systemic Immunomodulating Therapies for Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal 
      Necrolysis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 514-522
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.5668 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) are 
      rare but severe adverse reactions with high mortality. There is no evidence-based 
      treatment, but various systemic immunomodulating therapies are used. OBJECTIVES: To 
      provide an overview on possible immunomodulating treatments for SJS/TEN and estimate 
      their effects on mortality compared with supportive care. DATA SOURCES: A literature 
      search was performed in December 2012 for articles published in MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
      Daily, MEDLINE Inprocess, Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library 
      (Central) from January 1990 through December 2012, and updated in December 2015, in 
      the English, French, Spanish, and German languages looking for treatment proposals 
      for SJS/TEN. Other sources were screened manually. STUDY SELECTION: Initially, 157 
      randomized and nonrandomized studies on therapies (systemic immunomodulating 
      therapies or supportive care) for SJS/TEN were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND 
      SYNTHESIS: Relevant data were extracted from articles. Authors were contacted for 
      further information. Finally, 96 studies with sufficient information regarding 
      eligibility and adequate quality scores were considered in the data synthesis. All 
      steps were performed independently by 2 investigators. Meta-analyses on aggregated 
      study data (random-effects model) and individual patient data (IPD) (logistic 
      regression adjusted for confounders) were performed to assess therapeutic efficacy. 
      In the analysis of IPD, 2 regression models, stratified and unstratified by study, 
      were fitted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Therapy effects on mortality were expressed 
      in terms of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Overall, 96 studies (3248 
      patients) were included. Applied therapies were supportive care or systemic 
      immunomodulating therapies, including glucocorticosteroids, intravenous 
      immunoglobulins, cyclosporine, plasmapheresis, thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, 
      hemoperfusion, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and granulocyte colony-stimulating 
      factors. Glucocorticosteroids were associated with a survival benefit for patients 
      in all 3 analyses but were statistically significant in only one (aggregated data: 
      OR, 0.5; 95%% CI, 0.3-1.01; IPD, unstratified: OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.97; IPD, 
      stratified: OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4-1.3). Despite the low patient size, cyclosporine 
      was associated with a promising significant result in the only feasible analysis of 
      IPD (unstratified model) (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-0.4). No beneficial findings were 
      observed for other therapies, including intravenous immunoglobulins. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Although all analyses, including the unstratified model, had limitations, 
      glucocorticosteroids and cyclosporine were the most promising systemic 
      immunomodulating therapies for SJS/TEN. Further evaluation in prospective studies is 
      required. However, this work provides a comprehensive overview on proposed systemic 
      immunomodulating treatments for SJS/TEN, which is of great relevance for treating 
      physicians.

TI  - Associations of Maternal Vitamin B12 Concentration in Pregnancy With the Risks of 
      Preterm Birth and Low Birth Weight: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 
      Individual Participant Data.
PG  - 212-223
LID - 10.1093/aje/kww212 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin B12 (hereafter referred to as B12) deficiency in pregnancy is prevalent and 
      has been associated with both lower birth weight (birth weight <2,500 g) and preterm 
      birth (length of gestation <37 weeks). Nevertheless, current evidence is 
      contradictory. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of individual 
      participant data to evaluate the associations of maternal serum or plasma B12 
      concentrations in pregnancy with offspring birth weight and length of gestation. 
      Twenty-two eligible studies were identified (11,993 observations). Eighteen studies 
      were included in the meta-analysis (11,216 observations). No linear association was 
      observed between maternal B12 levels in pregnancy and birth weight, but B12 
      deficiency (<148 pmol/L) was associated with a higher risk of low birth weight in 
      newborns (adjusted risk ratio = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.31). 
      There was a linear association between maternal levels of B12 and preterm birth (per 
      each 1-standard-deviation increase in B12, adjusted risk ratio = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82, 
      0.97). Accordingly, B12 deficiency was associated with a higher risk of preterm 
      birth (adjusted risk ratio = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.49). This finding supports the 
      need for randomized controlled trials of vitamin B12 supplementation in pregnancy.

TI  - Lactobacillus reuteri to Treat Infant Colic: A Meta-analysis.
LID - e20171811 [pii]
LID - 10.1542/peds.2017-1811 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 has shown promise in managing colic, but 
      conflicting study results have prevented a consensus on whether it is truly 
      effective. OBJECTIVE: Through an individual participant data meta-analysis, we 
      sought to definitively determine if L reuteri DSM17938 effectively reduces crying 
      and/or fussing time in infants with colic and whether effects vary by feeding type. 
      DATA SOURCES: We searched online databases (PubMed, Medline, Embase, the Cumulative 
      Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews 
      of Effects, and Cochrane), e-abstracts, and clinical trial registries. STUDY 
      SELECTION: These were double-blind randomized controlled trials (published by June 
      2017) of L reuteri DSM17398 versus a placebo, delivered orally to infants with 
      colic, with outcomes of infant crying and/or fussing duration and treatment success 
      at 21 days. DATA EXTRACTION: We collected individual participant raw data from 
      included studies modeled simultaneously in multilevel generalized linear 
      mixed-effects regression models. RESULTS: Four double-blind trials involving 345 
      infants with colic (174 probiotic and 171 placebo) were included. The probiotic 
      group averaged less crying and/or fussing time than the placebo group at all time 
      points (day 21 adjusted mean difference in change from baseline [minutes] -25.4 [95% 
      confidence interval (CI): -47.3 to -3.5]). The probiotic group was almost twice as 
      likely as the placebo group to experience treatment success at all time points (day 
      21 adjusted incidence ratio 1.7 [95% CI: 1.4 to 2.2]). Intervention effects were 
      dramatic in breastfed infants (number needed to treat for day 21 success 2.6 [95% 
      CI: 2.0 to 3.6]) but were insignificant in formula-fed infants. LIMITATIONS: There 
      were insufficient data to make conclusions for formula-fed infants with colic. 
      CONCLUSIONS: L reuteri DSM17938 is effective and can be recommended for breastfed 
      infants with colic. Its role in formula-fed infants with colic needs further 
      research.

TI  - Inhaled Cannabis for Chronic Neuropathic Pain: A Meta-analysis of Individual Patient

AB  - Chronic neuropathic pain, the most frequent condition affecting the peripheral 
      nervous system, remains underdiagnosed and difficult to treat. Inhaled cannabis may 
      alleviate chronic neuropathic pain. Our objective was to synthesize the evidence on 
      the use of inhaled cannabis for chronic neuropathic pain. We performed a systematic 
      review and a meta-analysis of individual patient data. We registered our protocol 
      with PROSPERO CRD42011001182. We searched in Cochrane Central, PubMed, EMBASE, and 
      AMED. We considered all randomized controlled trials investigating chronic painful 
      neuropathy and comparing inhaled cannabis with placebo. We pooled treatment effects 
      following a hierarchical random-effects Bayesian responder model for the 
      population-averaged subject-specific effect. Our evidence synthesis of individual 
      patient data from 178 participants with 405 observed responses in 5 randomized 
      controlled trials following patients for days to weeks provides evidence that 
      inhaled cannabis results in short-term reductions in chronic neuropathic pain for 1 
      in every 5 to 6 patients treated (number needed to treat = 5.6 with a Bayesian 95% 
      credible interval ranging between 3.4 and 14). Our inferences were insensitive to 
      model assumptions, priors, and parameter choices. We caution that the small number 
      of studies and participants, the short follow-up, shortcomings in allocation 
      concealment, and considerable attrition limit the conclusions that can be drawn from 
      the review. The Bayes factor is 332, corresponding to a posterior probability of 
      effect of 99.7%. PERSPECTIVE: This novel Bayesian meta-analysis of individual 
      patient data from 5 randomized trials suggests that inhaled cannabis may provide 
      short-term relief for 1 in 5 to 6 patients with neuropathic pain. Pragmatic trials 
      are needed to evaluate the long-term benefits and risks of this treatment.

TI  - Effect of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment on clinical outcomes in 
      intensive care unit patients with infection and sepsis patients: a patient-level 
      meta-analysis of randomized trials.
PG  - 191
LID - 10.1186/s13054-018-2125-7 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of serum procalcitonin levels in guiding antibiotic 
      treatment decisions in patients with sepsis remains unclear. This patient-level 
      meta-analysis based on 11 randomized trials investigates the impact of 
      procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy on mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) 
      patients with infection, both overall and stratified according to sepsis definition, 
      severity, and type of infection. METHODS: For this meta-analysis focusing on 
      procalcitonin-guided antibiotic management in critically ill patients with sepsis of 
      any type, in February 2018 we updated the database of a previous individual patient 
      data meta-analysis which was limited to patients with respiratory infections only. 
      We used individual patient data from 11 trials that randomly assigned patients to 
      receive antibiotics based on procalcitonin levels (the "procalcitonin-guided" group) 
      or the current standard of care (the "controls"). The primary endpoint was mortality 
      within 30 days. Secondary endpoints were duration of antibiotic treatment and length 
      of stay. RESULTS: Mortality in the 2252 procalcitonin-guided patients was 
      significantly lower compared with the 2230 control group patients (21.1% vs 23.7%; 
      adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 0.99; p = 0.03). These 
      effects on mortality persisted in a subgroup of patients meeting the sepsis 3 
      definition and based on the severity of sepsis (assessed on the basis of the 
      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, occurrence of septic shock or 
      renal failure, and need for vasopressor or ventilatory support) and on the type of 
      infection (respiratory, urinary tract, abdominal, skin, or central nervous system), 
      with interaction for each analysis being > 0.05. Procalcitonin guidance also 
      facilitated earlier discontinuation of antibiotics, with a reduction in treatment 
      duration (9.3 vs 10.4 days; adjusted coefficient -1.19 days, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.66; 
      p <  0.001). CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients 
      with infection and sepsis patients results in improved survival and lower antibiotic 
      treatment duration.

TI  - Time to Treatment With Endovascular Thrombectomy and Outcomes From Ischemic Stroke: 
      A Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1279-88
LID - 10.1001/jama.2016.13647 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Endovascular thrombectomy with second-generation devices is beneficial 
      for patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusions. 
      Delineation of the association of treatment time with outcomes would help to guide 
      implementation. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the period in which endovascular 
      thrombectomy is associated with benefit, and the extent to which treatment delay is 
      related to functional outcomes, mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Demographic, clinical, and brain imaging data as well 
      as functional and radiologic outcomes were pooled from randomized phase 3 trials 
      involving stent retrievers or other second-generation devices in a peer-reviewed 
      publication (by July 1, 2016). The identified 5 trials enrolled patients at 89 
      international sites. EXPOSURES: Endovascular thrombectomy plus medical therapy vs 
      medical therapy alone; time to treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome was degree of disability (mRS range, 0-6; lower scores indicating less 
      disability) at 3 months, analyzed with the common odds ratio (cOR) to detect ordinal 
      shift in the distribution of disability over the range of the mRS; secondary 
      outcomes included functional independence at 3 months, mortality by 3 months, and 
      symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. RESULTS: Among all 1287 patients 
      (endovascular thrombectomy + medical therapy [n = 634]; medical therapy alone 
      [n = 653]) enrolled in the 5 trials (mean age, 66.5 years [SD, 13.1]; women, 47.0%), 
      time from symptom onset to randomization was 196 minutes (IQR, 142 to 267). Among 
      the endovascular group, symptom onset to arterial puncture was 238 minutes (IQR, 180 
      to 302) and symptom onset to reperfusion was 286 minutes (IQR, 215 to 363). At 90 
      days, the mean mRS score was 2.9 (95% CI, 2.7 to 3.1) in the endovascular group and 
      3.6 (95% CI, 3.5 to 3.8) in the medical therapy group. The odds of better disability 
      outcomes at 90 days (mRS scale distribution) with the endovascular group declined 
      with longer time from symptom onset to arterial puncture: cOR at 3 hours, 2.79 (95% 
      CI, 1.96 to 3.98), absolute risk difference (ARD) for lower disability scores, 
      39.2%; cOR at 6 hours, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.30 to 3.00), ARD, 30.2%; cOR at 8 hours,1.57 
      (95% CI, 0.86 to 2.88), ARD, 15.7%; retaining statistical significance through 7 
      hours and 18 minutes. Among 390 patients who achieved substantial reperfusion with 
      endovascular thrombectomy, each 1-hour delay to reperfusion was associated with a 
      less favorable degree of disability (cOR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.93]; ARD, -6.7%) 
      and less functional independence (OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.92], ARD, -5.2% [95% 
      CI, -8.3% to -2.1%]), but no change in mortality (OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.34]; 
      ARD, 1.5% [95% CI, -0.9% to 4.2%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this individual 
      patient data meta-analysis of patients with large-vessel ischemic stroke, earlier 
      treatment with endovascular thrombectomy + medical therapy compared with medical 
      therapy alone was associated with lower degrees of disability at 3 months. Benefit 
      became nonsignificant after 7.3 hours.

TI  - Beta-blockers for heart failure with reduced, mid-range, and preserved ejection 
      fraction: an individual patient-level analysis of double-blind randomized trials.
PG  - 26-35
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehx564 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Recent guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure and left 
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40-49% should be managed similar to LVEF ≥ 50%. 
      We investigated the effect of beta-blockers according to LVEF in double-blind, 
      randomized, placebo-controlled trials. METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual patient data 
      meta-analysis of 11 trials, stratified by baseline LVEF and heart rhythm 
      (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT0083244; PROSPERO: CRD42014010012). Primary outcomes were 
      all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death over 1.3 years median follow-up, with 
      an intention-to-treat analysis. For 14 262 patients in sinus rhythm, median LVEF was 
      27% (interquartile range 21-33%), including 575 patients with LVEF 40-49% and 
      244 ≥ 50%. Beta-blockers reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared to 
      placebo in sinus rhythm, an effect that was consistent across LVEF strata, except 
      for those in the small subgroup with LVEF ≥ 50%. For LVEF 40-49%, death occurred in 
      21/292 [7.2%] randomized to beta-blockers compared to 35/283 [12.4%] with placebo; 
      adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-1.03]. 
      Cardiovascular death occurred in 13/292 [4.5%] with beta-blockers and 26/283 [9.2%] 
      with placebo; adjusted HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.24-0.97). Over a median of 1.0 years 
      following randomization (n = 4601), LVEF increased with beta-blockers in all groups 
      in sinus rhythm except LVEF ≥50%. For patients in atrial fibrillation at baseline 
      (n = 3050), beta-blockers increased LVEF when < 50% at baseline, but did not improve 
      prognosis. CONCLUSION: Beta-blockers improve LVEF and prognosis for patients with 
      heart failure in sinus rhythm with a reduced LVEF. The data are most robust for 
      LVEF < 40%, but similar benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with LVEF 
      40-49%.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Oseltamivir in Children: Systematic Review and Individual 
      Patient Data Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 1492-1500
LID - 10.1093/cid/cix1040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oseltamivir has been used to treat children with influenza for nearly 2 
      decades, with treatment currently approved for infants aged ≥2 weeks. However, 
      efficacy and safety remain controversial. Newer randomized, placebo-controlled 
      trials (RCTs), not included in previous meta-analyses, can add to the evidence base. 
      METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to identify RCTs of oseltamivir therapy in 
      children. We obtained individual patient data and examined protocol-defined 
      outcomes. We then conducted a 2-stage, random-effects meta-analysis to determine the 
      efficacy of treatment in reducing the duration of illness, estimated using 
      differences in restricted mean survival time (RMST) by treatment group. We also 
      examined complications and safety. RESULTS: We identified 5 trials that included 
      2561 patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and 1598 in the intention-to-treat 
      infected (ITTI) populations. Overall, oseltamivir treatment significantly reduced 
      the duration of illness in the ITTI population (RMST difference, -17.6 hours; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], -34.7 to -0.62 hours). In trials that enrolled patients 
      without asthma, the difference was larger (-29.9 hours; 95% CI, -53.9 to -5.8 
      hours). Risk of otitis media was 34% lower in the ITTI population. Vomiting was the 
      only adverse event with a significantly higher risk in the treatment group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial heterogeneity in pediatric trials, we found that 
      treatment with oseltamivir significantly reduced the duration of illness in those 
      with influenza and lowered the risk of developing otitis media. Alternative 
      endpoints may be required to evaluate the efficacy of oseltamivir in pediatric 
      patients with asthma.

TI  - Nonnutritive sweeteners and cardiometabolic health: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies.
PG  - E929-E939
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.161390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonnutritive sweeteners, such as aspartame, sucralose and stevioside, 
      are widely consumed, yet their long-term health impact is uncertain. We synthesized 
      evidence from prospective studies to determine whether routine consumption of 
      non-nutritive sweeteners was associated with long-term adverse cardiometabolic 
      effects. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library (inception to 
      January 2016) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated interventions 
      for nonnutritive sweeteners and prospective cohort studies that reported on 
      consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners among adults and adolescents. The primary 
      outcome was body mass index (BMI). Secondary outcomes included weight, obesity and 
      other cardiometabolic end points. RESULTS: From 11 774 citations, we included 7 
      trials (1003 participants; median follow-up 6 mo) and 30 cohort studies (405 907 
      participants; median follow-up 10 yr). In the included RCTs, nonnutritive sweeteners 
      had no significant effect on BMI (mean difference -0.37 kg/m(2); 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] -1.10 to 0.36; I(2) 9%; 242 participants). In the included cohort 
      studies, consumption of nonnutritive sweeteners was associated with a modest 
      increase in BMI (mean correlation 0.05, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.06; I(2) 0%; 21 256 
      participants). Data from RCTs showed no consistent effects of nonnutritive 
      sweeteners on other measures of body composition and reported no further secondary 
      outcomes. In the cohort studies, consumption of nonnutritive sweeteners was 
      associated with increases in weight and waist circumference, and higher incidence of 
      obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
      events. Publication bias was indicated for studies with diabetes as an outcome. 
      INTERPRETATION: Evidence from RCTs does not clearly support the intended benefits of 
      nonnutritive sweeteners for weight management, and observational data suggest that 
      routine intake of nonnutritive sweeteners may be associated with increased BMI and 
      cardiometabolic risk. Further research is needed to fully characterize the long-term 
      risks and benefits of nonnutritive sweeteners. Protocol registration:

AB  - Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent lymphoma. Therapeutic advances 
      in the past decade have improved its prognosis, but some questions remain open, 
      particularly over adapting therapy to each individual patient's disease risk. 
      Several trials and large studies dealing with biological and therapeutic aspects of 
      FL have been published in the past few months and may have immediate or near-future 
      practice-changing implications. These studies include risk-assessment by gene 
      expression profiling, the therapeutic strategy in localized FL, use of obinutuzumab 
      or lenalidomide in the front-line setting, stem cell transplant in early treatment 
      failure and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition and chimeric antigen 
      receptor (CAR) T-cells in multiply relapsed disease. This review aims to 
      contextualize these studies, summarize their design and results, assess their 
      impact, highlight related questions that remain unanswered and, finally, provide a 
      personal view as to how they change our approach to non-transformed FL.

TI  - Meta-analysis of individual-patient data from EVAR-1, DREAM, OVER and ACE trials 
      comparing outcomes of endovascular or open repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm over 
      5 years.
PG  - 166-178
LID - 10.1002/bjs.10430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The erosion of the early mortality advantage of elective endovascular 
      aneurysm repair (EVAR) compared with open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm 
      remains without a satisfactory explanation. METHODS: An individual-patient data 
      meta-analysis of four multicentre randomized trials of EVAR versus open repair was 
      conducted to a prespecified analysis plan, reporting on mortality, aneurysm-related 
      mortality and reintervention. RESULTS: The analysis included 2783 patients, with 
      14 245 person-years of follow-up (median 5·5 years). Early (0-6 months after 
      randomization) mortality was lower in the EVAR groups (46 of 1393 versus 73 of 1390 
      deaths; pooled hazard ratio 0·61, 95 per cent c.i. 0·42 to 0·89; P = 0·010), 
      primarily because 30-day operative mortality was lower in the EVAR groups (16 deaths 
      versus 40 for open repair; pooled odds ratio 0·40, 95 per cent c.i. 0·22 to 0·74). 
      Later (within 3 years) the survival curves converged, remaining converged to 8 
      years. Beyond 3 years, aneurysm-related mortality was significantly higher in the 
      EVAR groups (19 deaths versus 3 for open repair; pooled hazard ratio 5·16, 1·49 to 
      17·89; P = 0·010). Patients with moderate renal dysfunction or previous coronary 
      artery disease had no early survival advantage under EVAR. Those with peripheral 
      artery disease had lower mortality under open repair (39 deaths versus 62 for EVAR; 
      P = 0·022) in the period from 6 months to 4 years after randomization. CONCLUSION: 
      The early survival advantage in the EVAR group, and its subsequent erosion, were 
      confirmed. Over 5 years, patients of marginal fitness had no early survival 
      advantage from EVAR compared with open repair. Aneurysm-related mortality and 
      patients with low ankle : brachial pressure index contributed to the erosion of the 
      early survival advantage for the EVAR group. Trial registration numbers: EVAR-1, 
      ISRCTN55703451; DREAM (Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Management), 
      NCT00421330; ACE (Anévrysme de l'aorte abdominale, Chirurgie versus Endoprothèse), 
      NCT00224718; OVER (Open Versus Endovascular Repair Trial for Abdominal Aortic 
      Aneurysms), NCT00094575.

TI  - Effectiveness of physiotherapy with telerehabilitation in surgical patients: a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.

LID - S0031-9406(18)30075-0 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the last few years, telerehabilitation services have developed 
      rapidly, and patients value benefits such as reduced travelling barriers, flexible 
      exercise hours, and the possibility to better integrate skills into daily life. 
      However, the effects of physiotherapy with telerehabilitation on postoperative 
      functional outcomes compared with usual care in surgical populations are still 
      inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of physiotherapy with 
      telerehabilitation on postoperative functional outcomes and quality of life in 
      surgical patients. DATA SOURCES: Relevant studies were obtained from MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, PEDro, Google Scholar and the World Health 
      Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. STUDY SELECTION: 
      Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, quasi-randomised studies 
      and quasi-experimental studies with comparative controls were included with no 
      restrictions in terms of language or date of publication. DATA EXTRACTION AND 
      SYNTHESIS: Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 
      Twenty-three records were included for qualitative synthesis. Seven studies were 
      eligible for quantitative synthesis on quality of life, and the overall pooled 
      standardised mean difference was 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 1.84), 
      indicating an increase in favour of telerehabilitation in surgical patients. 
      LIMITATIONS: The variety in contents of intervention and outcome measures restricted 
      the performance of a meta-analysis on all clinical outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Physiotherapy with telerehabilitation has the potential to increase quality of life, 
      is feasible, and is at least equally effective as usual care in surgical 
      populations. This may be sufficient reason to choose physiotherapy with 
      telerehabilitation for surgical populations, although the overall effectiveness on 
      physical outcomes remains unclear. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42015017744.

TI  - Neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      regulatory and mortality data.
PG  - 1-242
LID - 10.3310/hta20420 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) are stockpiled and recommended by public 
      health agencies for treating and preventing seasonal and pandemic influenza. They 
      are used clinically worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To (1) describe the potential benefits 
      and harms of NIs for influenza in all age groups by reviewing all clinical study 
      reports (CSRs) of published and unpublished randomised, placebo-controlled trials 
      and regulatory comments; and (2) determine the effect of oseltamivir (Tamiflu(®), 
      Roche) treatment on mortality in patients with 2009A/H1N1 influenza. METHODS: We 
      searched trial registries, electronic databases and corresponded with regulators and 
      sponsors to identify randomised trials of NIs. We requested full CSRs and accessed 
      regulators' comments. We included only those trials for which we had CSRs. To 
      examine the effects of oseltamivir on 2009A/H1N1 influenza mortality, we requested 
      individual patient data (IPD) from corresponding authors of all included 
      observational studies. RESULTS: Effect of oseltamivir and zanamivir (Relenza®, 
      GlaxoSmithKline) in the prevention and treatment of influenza: Oseltamivir reduced 
      the time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults by 16.8 hours [95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 8.4 to 25.1 hours]. Zanamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of 
      symptoms in adults by 0.60 days (95% CI 0.39 to 0.81 days). Oseltamivir reduced 
      unverified pneumonia in adult treatment [risk difference (RD) 1.00%, 95% CI 0.22% to 
      1.49%]; similar findings were observed with zanamivir prophylaxis in adults (RD 
      0.32%, 95% CI 0.09% to 0.41%). Oseltamivir treatment of adults increased the risk of 
      nausea (RD 3.66%, 95% CI 0.90% to 7.39%) and vomiting (RD 4.56%, 95% CI 2.39% to 
      7.58%). In the treatment of children, oseltamivir induced vomiting (RD 5.34%, 95% CI 
      1.75% to 10.29%). Both oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis reduced the risk of 
      symptomatic influenza in individuals (oseltamivir RD 3.05%, 95% CI 1.83% to 3.88%; 
      zanamivir RD 1.98%, 95% CI 0.98% to 2.54%) and in households (oseltamivir RD 13.6%, 
      95% CI 9.52% to 15.47%; zanamivir RD 14.84%, 95% CI 12.18% to 16.55%). Oseltamivir 
      increased psychiatric adverse events in the combined on- and off-treatment periods 
      (RD 1.06%, 95% CI 0.07% to 2.76%) and the risk of headaches while on treatment (RD 
      3.15%, 95% CI 0.88% to 5.78%). Effect of oseltamivir on mortality in patients with 
      2009A/H1N1 influenza: Analysis of summary data of 30 studies as well as IPD of four 
      studies showed evidence of time-dependent bias. After adjusting for time-dependent 
      bias and potential confounding variables, competing risks analysis of the IPD showed 
      insufficient evidence that oseltamivir reduced the risk of mortality (hazard ratio 
      1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.65). CONCLUSIONS: Oseltamivir and zanamivir cause small 
      reductions in the time to first alleviation of influenza symptoms in adults. The use 
      of oseltamivir increases the risk of nausea, vomiting, psychiatric events in adults 
      and vomiting in children. Oseltamivir has no protective effect on mortality among 
      patients with 2009A/H1N1 influenza. Prophylaxis with either NI may reduce 
      symptomatic influenza in individuals and in households. The balance between benefits 
      and harms should be considered when making decisions about use of NIs for either 
      prophylaxis or treatment of influenza. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered 
      as PROSPERO CRD42012002245. FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research

      view.
PG  - 1352-1356
LID - 10.1002/clc.22814 [doi]
AB  - Increasing numbers of patients with arthritis use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs (NSAIDs), some for long periods. The relative cardiovascular safety of NSAID 
      use is of considerable concern, particularly among patients with or at risk of 
      cardiovascular disease. Until recently, the evidence base was limited to older 
      trials with small sample sizes. The large-scale Prospective Randomized Evaluation of 
      Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) trial and a recent 
      Bayesian meta-analysis of individual patient data in nearly a half-million patients 
      were undertaken to address some of the existing gaps in knowledge relative to the 
      cardiovascular safety of NSAID use. We reviewed the results, strengths, and 
      limitations of PRECISION. We believe that the results of the meta-analysis will 
      further assist clinicians in decision-making for management of patients with 
      osteoarthritis. The totality of evidence would support avoidance of NSAID use, if 
      possible, in patients with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease. If used, the 
      shortest-duration and lowest effective NSAID doses should be chosen, given the 
      evidence that risk is duration- and dose-dependent. We also provide a brief 
      discussion of the mechanism of action of NSAIDs, along with discussion of existing 
      guidelines and the recent meta-analysis.

TI  - Baseline and on-statin treatment lipoprotein(a) levels for prediction of 
      cardiovascular events: individual patient-data meta-analysis of statin outcome 
      trials.
PG  - 1311-1320
LID - S0140-6736(18)31652-0 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular 
      disease in general population studies. However, its contribution to risk for 
      cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease or on 
      statin therapy is uncertain. METHODS: Patient-level data from seven randomised, 
      placebo-controlled, statin outcomes trials were collated and harmonised to calculate 
      hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular events, defined as fatal or non-fatal 
      coronary heart disease, stroke, or revascularisation procedures. HRs for 
      cardiovascular events were estimated within each trial across predefined 
      lipoprotein(a) groups (15 to <30 mg/dL, 30 to <50 mg/dL, and ≥50 mg/dL, vs <15 
      mg/dL), before pooling estimates using multivariate random-effects meta-analysis. 
      FINDINGS: Analyses included data for 29 069 patients with repeat lipoprotein(a) 
      measurements (mean age 62 years [SD 8]; 8064 [28%] women; 5751 events during 95 576 
      person-years at risk). Initiation of statin therapy reduced LDL cholesterol (mean 
      change -39% [95% CI -43 to -35]) without a significant change in lipoprotein(a). 
      Associations of baseline and on-statin treatment lipoprotein(a) with cardiovascular 
      disease risk were approximately linear, with increased risk at lipoprotein(a) values 
      of 30 mg/dL or greater for baseline lipoprotein(a) and 50 mg/dL or greater for 
      on-statin lipoprotein(a). For baseline lipoprotein(a), HRs adjusted for age and sex 
      (vs <15 mg/dL) were 1·04 (95% CI 0·91-1·18) for 15 mg/dL to less than 30 mg/dL, 1·11 
      (1·00-1·22) for 30 mg/dL to less than 50 mg/dL, and 1·31 (1·08-1·58) for 50 mg/dL or 
      higher; respective HRs for on-statin lipoprotein(a) were 0·94 (0·81-1·10), 1·06 
      (0·94-1·21), and 1·43 (1·15-1·76). HRs were almost identical after further 
      adjustment for previous cardiovascular disease, diabetes, smoking, systolic blood 
      pressure, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. The association of on-statin 
      lipoprotein(a) with cardiovascular disease risk was stronger than for on-placebo 
      lipoprotein(a) (interaction p=0·010) and was more pronounced at younger ages 
      (interaction p=0·008) without effect-modification by any other patient-level or 
      study-level characteristics. INTERPRETATION: In this individual-patient data 
      meta-analysis of statin-treated patients, elevated baseline and on-statin 
      lipoprotein(a) showed an independent approximately linear relation with 
      cardiovascular disease risk. This study provides a rationale for testing the

TI  - Vaginal progesterone decreases preterm birth and neonatal morbidity and mortality in 
      women with a twin gestation and a short cervix: an updated meta-analysis of 
      individual patient data.
PG  - 303-314
LID - 10.1002/uog.17397 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of vaginal progesterone for the prevention of 
      preterm birth and neonatal morbidity and mortality in asymptomatic women with a twin 
      gestation and a sonographic short cervix (cervical length ≤ 25 mm) in the 
      mid-trimester. METHODS: This was an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      individual patient data (IPD) from randomized controlled trials comparing vaginal 
      progesterone with placebo/no treatment in women with a twin gestation and a 
      mid-trimester sonographic cervical length ≤ 25 mm. MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, CINAHL 
      and LILACS (all from inception to 31 December 2016), the Cochrane Central Register 
      of Controlled Trials, Research Registers of ongoing trials, Google Scholar, 
      conference proceedings and reference lists of identified studies were searched. The 
      primary outcome measure was preterm birth < 33 weeks' gestation. Two reviewers 
      independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. 
      Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. 
      RESULTS: IPD were available for 303 women (159 assigned to vaginal progesterone and 
      144 assigned to placebo/no treatment) and their 606 fetuses/infants from six 
      randomized controlled trials. One study, which included women with a cervical length 
      between 20 and 25 mm, provided 74% of the total sample size of the IPD 
      meta-analysis. Vaginal progesterone, compared with placebo/no treatment, was 
      associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of preterm birth < 
      33 weeks' gestation (31.4% vs 43.1%; RR, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.51-0.93); moderate-quality 
      evidence). Moreover, vaginal progesterone administration was associated with a 
      significant decrease in the risk of preterm birth < 35, < 34, < 32 and < 30 weeks' 
      gestation (RRs ranging from 0.47 to 0.83), neonatal death (RR, 0.53 (95% CI, 
      0.35-0.81)), respiratory distress syndrome (RR, 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56-0.89)), composite 
      neonatal morbidity and mortality (RR, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.34-0.98)), use of mechanical 
      ventilation (RR, 0.54 (95% CI, 0.36-0.81)) and birth weight < 1500 g (RR, 0.53 (95% 
      CI, 0.35-0.80)) (all moderate-quality evidence). There were no significant 
      differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 4-5 years of age between the vaginal 
      progesterone and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: Administration of vaginal progesterone 
      to asymptomatic women with a twin gestation and a sonographic short cervix in the 
      mid-trimester reduces the risk of preterm birth occurring at < 30 to < 35 
      gestational weeks, neonatal mortality and some measures of neonatal morbidity, 
      without any demonstrable deleterious effects on childhood neurodevelopment.

TI  - Effects of ferric carboxymaltose on hospitalisations and mortality rates in 
      iron-deficient heart failure patients: an individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 125-133
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.823 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Iron deficiency (ID) is a common co-morbidity in patients with heart failure 
      (HF) and has been suggested to be associated with poor prognosis. Recently completed 
      double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying HF patients with ID have 
      shown improvements in functional capacity, symptoms and quality of life when treated 
      with i.v. ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). This individual patient data meta-analysis 
      investigates the effect of FCM vs. placebo on recurrent hospitalisations and 
      mortality in HF patients with ID. METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual patient data were 
      extracted from four RCTs comparing FCM with placebo in patients with systolic HF and 
      ID. The main outcome measures were recurrent cardiovascular (CV) hospitalisations 
      and CV mortality. Other outcomes included cause-specific hospitalisations and death. 
      The main analyses of recurrent events were backed up by time-to-first-event 
      analyses. In total, 839 patients, of whom 504 were randomised to FCM, were included. 
      Compared with those taking placebo, patients on FCM had lower rates of recurrent CV 
      hospitalisations and CV mortality [rate ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      0.40-0.88; P = 0.009]. Treatment with FCM also reduced recurrent HF hospitalisations 
      and CV mortality (rate ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.33-0.86; P = 0.011) and recurrent CV 
      hospitalisations and all-cause mortality (rate ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.88; P = 
      0.009). Time-to-first-event analyses showed similar findings, with somewhat 
      attenuated treatment effects. The administration of i.v. FCM was not associated with 
      an increased risk for adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with i.v. FCM was 
      associated with a reduction in recurrent CV hospitalisations in systolic HF patients 
      with ID.

TI  - An international prognostic index for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia

AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is 
      currently undergoing improvements due to novel therapies and a plethora of 
      biological and genetic variables that add prognostic information to the classic 
      clinical staging systems. We established an international consortium with the aim to 
      create an international prognostic index for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL-IPI) 
      that integrates the major prognostic parameters. METHODS: We used results from a 
      systematic search of the Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group of MEDLINE, 
      Embase, and Central databases for prospective, clinical phase 2 and 3 trials of 
      chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, published between Jan 1, 1950, and Dec 31, 2010, 
      which identified 13 trials. We contacted the principal investigators of these 13 
      trials, of which eight agreed to include individual patient data. We used the 
      individual patient data from these phase 3 trials from France, Germany, Poland, the 
      UK, and the USA to create the full analysis dataset. The full analysis dataset was 
      randomly divided, using a random sample procedure, into training and 
      internal-validation datasets. We did a univariate analysis and multivariate analyses 
      using 27 baseline factors and overall survival as an endpoint. We assigned weighted 
      risk scores to each factor included in the final multivariable model. We assessed 
      the discriminatory value using C-statistics and also the validity and 
      reproducibility of the CLL-IPI by subgroup analysis. We used two additional datasets 
      from the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA; MAYO cohort) and the SCALE Scandinavian 
      population-based case-control study (SCAN cohort) as the external-validation 
      datasets. FINDINGS: 3472 treatment-naive patients were included in the full analysis 
      dataset; 2308 were randomly segregated into the training dataset and 1164 into the 
      internal-validation dataset. 838 patients were included in the MAYO cohort and 416 
      in the SCAN cohort. Median age of patients in the full analysis dataset was 61 years 
      (range 27-86). Five independent prognostic factors were identified in the training 
      dataset: TP53 status (no abnormalities vs del[17p] or TP53 mutation or both), IGHV 
      mutational status (mutated vs unmutated), serum β2-microglobulin concentration (≤3·5 
      mg/L vs >3·5 mg/L), clinical stage (Binet A or Rai 0 vs Binet B-C or Rai I-IV), and 
      age (≤65 years vs >65 years). Using a weighted grading of the independent factors, a 
      prognostic index was derived that identified four risk groups within the training 
      dataset with significantly different overall survival at 5 years: low (93·2% [95% CI 
      90·5-96·0]), intermediate (79·3% [75·5-83·2]), high (63·3% [57·9-68·8]), and very 
      high risk (23·3% [12·5-34·1]; log-rank test comparing survival across the four risk 
      groups p<0·0001; C-statistic, c=0·723 [95% CI 0·684-0·752]). These risk groups were 
      confirmed in the internal-validation and external-validation datasets. 
      INTERPRETATION: The CLL-IPI combines genetic, biochemical, and clinical parameters 
      into a prognostic model, discriminating four prognostic subgroups. The CLL-IPI will

TI  - Association of Maternal Iodine Status With Child IQ: A Meta-Analysis of Individual 
      Participant Data.
PG  - 5957-5967
LID - 10.1210/jc.2018-02559 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Although the consequences of severe iodine deficiency are beyond doubt, the 
      effects of mild to moderate iodine deficiency in pregnancy on child neurodevelopment 
      are less well established. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between maternal 
      iodine status during pregnancy and child IQ and identify vulnerable time windows of 
      exposure to suboptimal iodine availability. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of individual 
      participant data from three prospective population-based birth cohorts: Generation R 
      (Netherlands), INMA (Spain), and ALSPAC (United Kingdom); pregnant women were 
      enrolled between 2002 and 2006, 2003 and 2008, and 1990 and 1992, respectively. 
      SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: 6180 mother-child pairs with measures of 
      urinary iodine and creatinine concentrations in pregnancy and child IQ. Exclusion 
      criteria were multiple pregnancies, fertility treatment, medication affecting the 
      thyroid, and preexisting thyroid disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Child nonverbal and 
      verbal IQ assessed at 1.5 to 8 years of age. RESULTS: There was a positive 
      curvilinear association of urinary iodine/creatinine ratio (UI/Creat) with mean 
      verbal IQ only. UI/Creat <150 µg/g was not associated with lower nonverbal IQ (-0.6 
      point; 95% CI: -1.7 to 0.4 points; P = 0.246) or lower verbal IQ (-0.6 point; 95% 
      CI: -1.3 to 0.1 points; P = 0.082). Stratified analyses showed that the association 
      of UI/Creat with verbal IQ was only present up to 14 weeks of gestation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Fetal brain development is vulnerable to mild to moderate iodine 
      deficiency, particularly in the first trimester. Our results show that potential 
      randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of iodine supplementation in 
      women with mild to moderate iodine deficiency on child neurodevelopment should begin 
      supplementation not later than the first trimester.

TI  - Antenatal magnesium sulphate and adverse neonatal outcomes: A systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - e1002988
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002988 [doi]
LID - e1002988
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is widespread, increasing use of magnesium sulphate in obstetric 
      practice for pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and preterm fetal neuroprotection; benefit 
      for preventing preterm labour and birth (tocolysis) is unproven. We conducted a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether antenatal magnesium sulphate 
      is associated with unintended adverse neonatal outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 
      CINAHL, Cochrane Library, LILACS, MEDLINE, Embase, TOXLINE, and Web of Science, were 
      searched (inceptions to 3 September 2019). Randomised, quasi-randomised, and 
      non-randomised trials, cohort and case-control studies, and case reports assessing 
      antenatal magnesium sulphate for pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, fetal neuroprotection, or 
      tocolysis, compared with placebo/no treatment or a different magnesium sulphate 
      regimen, were included. The primary outcome was perinatal death. Secondary outcomes 
      included pre-specified and non-pre-specified adverse neonatal outcomes. Two 
      reviewers screened 5,890 articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias 
      following Cochrane Handbook and RTI Item Bank guidance. For randomised trials, 
      pooled risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), 
      were calculated using fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis. Non-randomised data 
      were tabulated and narratively summarised. We included 197 studies (40 randomised 
      trials, 138 non-randomised studies, and 19 case reports), of mixed quality. The 40 
      trials (randomising 19,265 women and their babies) were conducted from 1987 to 2018 
      across high- (16 trials) and low/middle-income countries (23 trials) (1 mixed). 
      Indications included pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (24 trials), fetal neuroprotection (7 
      trials), and tocolysis (9 trials); 18 trials compared magnesium sulphate with 
      placebo/no treatment, and 22 compared different regimens. For perinatal death, no 
      clear difference in randomised trials was observed between magnesium sulphate and 
      placebo/no treatment (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.10; 8 trials, 13,654 babies), nor 
      between regimens. Eleven of 138 non-randomised studies reported on perinatal death. 
      Only 1 cohort (127 babies; moderate to high risk of bias) observed an increased risk 
      of perinatal death with >48 versus ≤48 grams magnesium sulphate exposure for 
      tocolysis. No clear secondary adverse neonatal outcomes were observed in randomised 
      trials, and a very limited number of possible adverse outcomes warranting further 
      consideration were identified in non-randomised studies. Where non-randomised 
      studies observed possible harms, often no or few confounders were controlled for 
      (moderate to high risk of bias), samples were small (200 babies or fewer), and/or 
      results were from subgroup analyses. Limitations include missing data for important 
      outcomes across most studies, heterogeneity of included studies, and inclusion of 
      published data only. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support clear associations 
      between antenatal magnesium sulphate for beneficial indications and adverse neonatal 
      outcomes. Further large, high-quality studies (prospective cohorts or individual 
      participant data meta-analyses) assessing specific outcomes, or the impact of 
      regimen, pregnancy, or birth characteristics on these outcomes, would further inform 
      safety recommendations. PROSPERO: CRD42013004451.

TI  - The use of virtual reality for balance among individuals with chronic stroke: a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 68-79
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is becoming a popular alternative to traditional 
      upper and lower limb rehabilitation following a stroke. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of VR interventions for 
      improving balance in a chronic stroke (≥6 months) population. DATA SOURCES: A 
      literature search of Pubmed, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase, Psycinfo, and Web of Science 
      databases was conducted. STUDY SELECTION: English randomized controlled trials 
      published up to September 2015 assessing balance with VR in chronic stroke 
      participants. DATA EXTRACTION: Mean and standard deviations from outcome measures 
      were extracted. Pooled standard mean differences ± standard error were calculated 
      for the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the Timed Up and Go test (TUG). RESULTS: In 
      total, 20 studies were selected which assessed the Nintendo(®) Wii Fit balance board 
      (n = 7), treadmill training and VR (n = 7), and postural training using VR (n = 6). 
      Significant improvements were found for VR interventions evaluating the BBS (n = 12; 
      MD = 2.94 ± 0.57; p < 0.001) and TUG (n = 13; MD = 2.49 ± 0.57; p < 0.001). 
      Sub-analyses revealed postural VR interventions had a significant effect on BBS 
      (n = 5) and TUG (n = 3) scores (BBS: MD = 3.82 ± 0.79; p < 0.001 and TUG: 
      MD = 3.74 ± 0.97; p < 0.001). VR and treadmill training (n = 5) had a significant 
      effect on TUG scores (MD = 2.15 ± 0.89, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Overall, VR 
      interventions compared to conventional rehabilitation had significant improvements. 
      The meta-analyses also suggest that the Nintendo(®) Wii Fit balance board may not be 
      effective, although further confirmatory studies are necessary. Results should be 
      interpreted with caution due to differences in therapy intensities and effect sizes 
      within the included studies.

TI  - Efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy in Prevention of Depressive Relapse: 
      An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis From Randomized Trials.
PG  - 565-74
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.0076 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Relapse prevention in recurrent depression is a significant public 
      health problem, and antidepressants are the current first-line treatment approach. 
      Identifying an equally efficacious nonpharmacological intervention would be an 
      important development. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis on individual patient 
      data to examine the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) compared 
      with usual care and other active treatments, including antidepressants, in treating 
      those with recurrent depression. DATA SOURCES: English-language studies published or 
      accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals identified from EMBASE, 
      PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials 
      Register from the first available year to November 22, 2014. Searches were conducted 
      from November 2010 to November 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials of 
      manualized MBCT for relapse prevention in recurrent depression in full or partial 
      remission that compared MBCT with at least 1 non-MBCT treatment, including usual 
      care. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: This was an update to a previous meta-analysis. 
      We screened 2555 new records after removing duplicates. Abstracts were screened for 
      full-text extraction (S.S.) and checked by another researcher (T.D.). There were no 
      disagreements. Of the original 2555 studies, 766 were evaluated against full study 
      inclusion criteria, and we acquired full text for 8. Of these, 4 studies were 
      excluded, and the remaining 4 were combined with the 6 studies identified from the 
      previous meta-analysis, yielding 10 studies for qualitative synthesis. Full patient 
      data were not available for 1 of these studies, resulting in 9 studies with 
      individual patient data, which were included in the quantitative synthesis. RESULTS: 
      Of the 1258 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 47.1 (11.9) years, and 944 
      (75.0%) were female. A 2-stage random effects approach showed that patients 
      receiving MBCT had a reduced risk of depressive relapse within a 60-week follow-up 
      period compared with those who did not receive MBCT (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 
      0.58-0.82). Furthermore, comparisons with active treatments suggest a reduced risk 
      of depressive relapse within a 60-week follow-up period (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 
      0.64-0.97). Using a 1-stage approach, sociodemographic (ie, age, sex, education, and 
      relationship status) and psychiatric (ie, age at onset and number of previous 
      episodes of depression) variables showed no statistically significant interaction 
      with MBCT treatment. However, there was some evidence to suggest that a greater 
      severity of depressive symptoms prior to treatment was associated with a larger 
      effect of MBCT compared with other treatments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy appears efficacious as a treatment for relapse 
      prevention for those with recurrent depression, particularly those with more 
      pronounced residual symptoms. Recommendations are made concerning how future trials 
      can address remaining uncertainties and improve the rigor of the field.

TI  - Cervical Pessary for Preventing Preterm Birth in Singleton Pregnancies With Short 
      Cervical Length: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1535-1543
LID - 10.7863/ultra.16.08054 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of cervical pessary for preventing 
      spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) in singleton gestations with a second trimester 
      short cervix. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from their inception until 
      February 2016. We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the use of 
      the cervical pessary with expectant management in singletons pregnancies with 
      transvaginal ultrasound cervical length (TVU CL) ≤25 mm. The primary outcome was 
      incidence of SPTB <34 weeks. The summary measures were reported as relative risk 
      (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Three RCTs (n = 1,420) were 
      included. The mean gestational age (GA) at randomization was approximately 22 weeks. 
      The Arabin pessary was used as intervention in all three trials, and was removed by 
      vaginal examination at approximately 37 weeks. Cervical pessary was not associated 
      with prevention of SPTB <37 (20.2% vs 50.2%; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.09), <34, 
      <32, and <28 weeks, compared to no pessary. No differences were found in the mean of 
      GA at, interval from randomization to delivery, incidence of preterm premature 
      rupture of membranes and of cesarean delivery, and in neonatal outcomes. The Arabin 
      pessary was associated with a significantly higher risk of vaginal discharge. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In singleton pregnancies with a TVU CL ≤25mm at 20(0) -24(6) weeks, the 
      Arabin pessary does not reduce the rate of spontaneous preterm delivery or improve 
      perinatal outcome. Individual patient data meta-analysis may clarify whether 
      cervical pessary may be beneficial in subgroups, such as only singleton gestations 
      without prior SPTB or by different CL cutoffs.

TI  - Subgroup analyses of the effectiveness of oral glucosamine for knee and hip 
      osteoarthritis: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis from 
      the OA trial bank.
PG  - 1862-1869
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-211149 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of oral glucosamine in subgroups of people 
      with hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA) based on baseline pain severity, body mass 
      index (BMI), sex, structural abnormalities and presence of inflammation using 
      individual patient data. METHODS: After a systematic search of the literature and 
      clinical trial registries, all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the 
      effect of any oral glucosamine substance in patients with clinically or 
      radiographically defined hip or knee OA were contacted. As a minimum, pain, age, sex 
      and BMI at baseline and pain as an outcome measure needed to be assessed. RESULTS: 
      Of 21 eligible studies, six (n=1663) shared their trial data with the OA Trial Bank. 
      Five trials (all independent of industry, n=1625) compared glucosamine with placebo, 
      representing 55% of the total number of participants in all published 
      placebo-controlled RCTs. Glucosamine was no better than placebo for pain or function 
      at short (3 months) and long-term (24 months) follow-up. Glucosamine was also no 
      better than placebo among the predefined subgroups. Stratification for knee OA and 
      type of glucosamine did not alter these results. CONCLUSIONS: Although proposed and 
      debated for several years, open trial data are not widely made available for studies 
      of glucosamine for OA, especially those sponsored by industry. Currently, there is 
      no good evidence to support the use of glucosamine for hip or knee OA and an absence 
      of evidence to support specific consideration of glucosamine for any clinically 
      relevant OA subgroup according to baseline pain severity, BMI, sex, structural 
      abnormalities or presence of inflammation.

TI  - First-line ovulation induction for polycystic ovary syndrome: an individual 
      participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - 717-732
LID - 10.1093/humupd/dmz029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most frequent cause of 
      anovulatory infertility. In women with PCOS, effective ovulation induction serves as 
      an important first-line treatment for anovulatory infertility. Individual 
      participant data (IPD) meta-analysis is considered as the gold standard for evidence 
      synthesis which provides accurate assessments of outcomes from primary randomised 
      controlled trials (RCTs) and allows additional analyses for time-to-event outcomes. 
      It also facilitates treatment-covariate interaction analyses and therefore offers an 
      opportunity for personalised medicine. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: We aimed to evaluate 
      the effectiveness of different ovulation induction agents, in particular letrozole 
      alone and clomiphene citrate (CC) plus metformin, as compared to CC alone, as the 
      first-line choice for ovulation induction in women with PCOS and infertility, and to 
      explore interactions between treatment and participant-level baseline 
      characteristics. SEARCH METHODS: We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 20 December 2018. We 
      included RCTs comparing the following interventions with each other or placebo/no 
      treatment in women with PCOS and infertility: CC, metformin, CC plus metformin, 
      letrozole, gonadotrophin and tamoxifen. We excluded studies on treatment-resistant 
      women. The primary outcome was live birth. We contacted the investigators of 
      eligible RCTs to share the IPD and performed IPD meta-analyses. We assessed the risk 
      of bias by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs. OUTCOMES: IPD of 20 RCTs 
      including 3962 women with PCOS were obtained. Six RCTs compared letrozole and CC in 
      1284 women. Compared with CC, letrozole improved live birth rates (3 RCTs, 1043 
      women, risk ratio [RR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.75, 
      moderate-certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy rates (6 RCTs, 1284 women, RR 
      1.45, 95% CI 1.23-1.70, moderate-certainty evidence) and reduced time-to-pregnancy 
      (6 RCTs, 1235 women, hazard ratio [HR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.38-2.15, moderate-certainty 
      evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive interaction 
      between baseline serum total testosterone levels and treatment effects on live birth 
      (interaction RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.65). Eight RCTs compared CC plus metformin to CC 
      alone in 1039 women. Compared with CC alone, CC plus metformin might improve 
      clinical pregnancy rates (8 RCTs, 1039 women, RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.39, 
      low-certainty evidence) and might reduce time-to-pregnancy (7 RCTs, 898 women, HR 
      1.25, 95% CI 1.00-1.57, low-certainty evidence), but there was insufficient evidence 
      of a difference on live birth rates (5 RCTs, 907 women, RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87-1.35, 
      low-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive 
      interaction between baseline insulin levels and treatment effects on live birth in 
      the comparison between CC plus metformin and CC (interaction RR 1.03, 95% CI 
      1.01-1.06). WIDER IMPLICATIONS: In women with PCOS, letrozole improves live birth 
      and clinical pregnancy rates and reduces time-to-pregnancy compared to CC and 
      therefore can be recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for women with 
      PCOS and infertility. CC plus metformin may increase clinical pregnancy and may 
      reduce time-to-pregnancy compared to CC alone, while there is insufficient evidence 
      of a difference on live birth. Treatment effects of letrozole are influenced by 
      baseline serum levels of total testosterone, while those of CC plus metformin are 
      affected by baseline serum levels of insulin. These interactions between treatments 
      and biomarkers on hyperandrogenaemia and insulin resistance provide further insights 
      into a personalised approach for the management of anovulatory infertility related 
      to PCOS.

TI  - Association of General Anesthesia vs Procedural Sedation With Functional Outcome 
      Among Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Undergoing Thrombectomy: A Systematic 
      Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1283-1293
LID - 10.1001/jama.2019.11455 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: General anesthesia during thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke has 
      been associated with poor neurological outcome in nonrandomized studies. Three 
      single-center randomized trials reported no significantly different or improved 
      outcomes for patients who received general anesthesia compared with procedural 
      sedation. OBJECTIVE: To detect differences in functional outcome at 3 months between 
      patients who received general anesthesia vs procedural sedation during thrombectomy 
      for anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE search for 
      English-language articles published from January 1, 1980, to July 31, 2019. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials of adults with a National Institutes of Health 
      Stroke Scale score of at least 10 and anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke 
      assigned to receive general anesthesia or procedural sedation during thrombectomy. 
      DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Individual patient data were obtained from 3 
      single-center, randomized, parallel-group, open-label treatment trials with blinded 
      end point evaluation that met inclusion criteria and were analyzed using 
      fixed-effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Degree of disability, 
      measured via the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (range 0-6; lower scores indicate 
      less disability), analyzed with the common odds ratio (cOR) to detect the ordinal 
      shift in the distribution of disability over the range of mRS scores. RESULTS: A 
      total of 368 patients (mean [SD] age, 71.5 [12.9] years; 163 [44.3%] women; median 
      [interquartile range] National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 17 [14-21]) 
      were included in the analysis, including 183 (49.7%) who received general anesthesia 
      and 185 (50.3%) who received procedural sedation. The mean 3-month mRS score was 2.8 
      (95% CI, 2.5-3.1) in the general anesthesia group vs 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0-3.5) in the 
      procedural sedation group (difference, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.03-0.83]; cOR, 1.58 [95% CI, 
      1.09-2.29]; P = .02). Among prespecified adverse events, only hypotension (decline 
      in systolic blood pressure of more than 20% from baseline) (80.8% vs 53.1%; OR, 4.26 
      [95% CI, 2.55-7.09]; P < .001) and blood pressure variability (systolic blood 
      pressure >180 mm Hg or <120 mm Hg) (79.7 vs 62.3%; OR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.49-3.93]; 
      P < .001) were significantly more common in the general anesthesia group. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with acute ischemic stroke involving the 
      anterior circulation undergoing thrombectomy, the use of protocol-based general 
      anesthesia, compared with procedural sedation, was significantly associated with 
      less disability at 3 months. These findings should be interpreted tentatively, given 
      that the individual trials examined were single-center trials and disability was the 
      primary outcome in only 1 trial.

TI  - Comparison of surgical and conservative treatment of Rockwood type-III 
      acromioclavicular dislocation: A meta-analysis.
PG  - e9690
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000009690 [doi]
LID - e9690
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the effects of surgical versus conservative 
      treatment on Rockwood type-III dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint in general 
      orthopedic practice. The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the clinical 
      outcomes of patients managed surgically and conservatively following type-III 
      acromioclavicular (AC) dislocation. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE 
      via Ovid SP, and PubMed databases were searched for randomized controlled trials and 
      observational studies. Patient data were pooled using standard meta-analytic 
      approaches. For continuous variables, the weighted mean difference was used. For 
      dichotomous data, the odds ratio was calculated. RESULTS: The current analysis 
      included 10 trials on this topic, and the results demonstrated that there were no 
      significant differences between surgical and conservative treatment in terms of 
      pain, weakness, tenderness, post-traumatic arthritis, restriction of strength, 
      unsatisfactory function, and scores (Constant, UCLA, Imatani, SST, DASH, Larsen). 
      Analyses of ossification of the coracoclavicular ligament (OR = 1.62, 95% 
      CI = 1.01-2.61) and osteolysis of the lateral clavicle (OR = 2.87, 95% 
      CI = 1.27-6.52) suggested better function with conservative treatment versus 
      surgical treatment, but the latter was superior to conservative treatment with 
      regard to loss of anatomic reduction. Only 1 study showed a higher acromioclavicular 
      joint instability score for surgical management compared with conservative 
      management (P < .00001). CONCLUSION: In the management of Rockwood type-III AC 
      dislocation, conservative treatment is superior to surgical treatment. Nonoperative 
      treatment results in a lower incidence of ossification of the coracoclavicular 
      ligament and osteolysis of the lateral clavicle compared with operative treatment. 
      However, there was no statistical difference between operative and nonoperative 
      treatment in terms of clinical outcomes.

TI  - Chemotherapy and radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: an update of the MAC-NPC 
      meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous individual patient data meta-analysis by the Meta-Analysis of 
      Chemotherapy in Nasopharynx Carcinoma (MAC-NPC) collaborative group to assess the 
      addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy showed that it improves overall survival in 
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This benefit was restricted to patients receiving 
      concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to update the 
      meta-analysis, include recent trials, and to analyse separately the benefit of 
      concomitant plus adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, 
      Cochrane Controlled Trials meta-register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and meeting 
      proceedings to identify published or unpublished randomised trials assessing 
      radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in patients with non-metastatic 
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma and obtained updated data for previously analysed studies. 
      The primary endpoint of interest was overall survival. All trial results were 
      combined and analysed using a fixed-effects model. The statistical analysis plan was 
      pre-specified in a protocol. All data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. 
      FINDINGS: We analysed data from 19 trials and 4806 patients. Median follow-up was 
      7·7 years (IQR 6·2-11·9). We found that the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy 
      significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·73-0·86, 
      p<0·0001; absolute benefit at 5 years 6·3%, 95% CI 3·5-9·1). The interaction between 
      treatment effect (benefit of chemotherapy) on overall survival and the timing of 
      chemotherapy was significant (p=0·01) in favour of concomitant plus adjuvant 
      chemotherapy (HR 0·65, 0·56-0·76) and concomitant without adjuvant chemotherapy 
      (0·80, 0·70-0·93) but not adjuvant chemotherapy alone (0·87, 0·68-1·12) or induction 
      chemotherapy alone (0·96, 0·80-1·16). The benefit of the addition of chemotherapy 
      was consistent for all endpoints analysed (all p<0·0001): progression-free survival 
      (HR 0·75, 95% CI 0·69-0·81), locoregional control (0·73, 0·64-0·83), distant control 
      (0·67, 0·59-0·75), and cancer mortality (0·76, 0·69-0·84). INTERPRETATION: Our 
      results confirm that the addition of concomitant chemotherapy to radiotherapy 
      significantly improves survival in patients with locoregionally advanced 
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis that examines 
      the effect of concomitant chemotherapy with and without adjuvant chemotherapy as 
      distinct groups. Further studies on the specific benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy 
      after concomitant chemoradiotherapy are needed. FUNDING: French Ministry of Health

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of prophylaxis for early adrenal insufficiency using 
      low-dose hydrocortisone on survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in very 
      preterm infants using an individual patient data meta-analysis. STUDY DESIGN: All 
      existing randomized controlled trials testing the efficacy of the prophylaxis of 
      early adrenal insufficiency using low-dose hydrocortisone on survival without BPD 
      were considered for inclusion when data were available. The primary outcome was the 
      binary variable survival without BPD at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. RESULTS: 
      Among 5 eligible studies, 4 randomized controlled trials had individual patient data 
      available (96% of participants identified; n = 982). Early low-dose hydrocortisone 
      treatment for 10-15 days was associated with a significant increase in survival 
      without BPD (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11-1.90; P = .007; I(2) = 0%), as well as with 
      decreases in medical treatment for patent ductus arteriosus (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 
      0.56-0.93; P = .01; I(2) = 0%) and death before discharge (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 
      0.51-0.97; P = .03; I(2) = 0%). The therapy was associated with an increased risk of 
      spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.33-4.69; P = .004; 
      I(2) = 31.9%) when hydrocortisone was given in association with indomethacin 
      exposure. The incidence of late-onset sepsis was increased in infants exposed to 
      hydrocortisone (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.02-1.75; P = .04; I(2) = 0%), but no adverse 
      effects were reported for either death or 2-year neurodevelopmental outcomes as 
      assessed in an aggregate meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This individual patient data 
      meta-analysis showed that early low-dose hydrocortisone therapy is beneficial for 
      survival without BPD in very preterm infants.

TI  - Laparoscopic versus open major hepatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      individual patient data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of laparoscopy for major hepatectomies remains a matter of 
      development to be further assessed. The purpose of this study is to compare the 
      short- and long-term outcomes between laparoscopic and open major hepatectomies 
      meta-analyzing individual patient data from published comparative studies. METHODS: 
      All retrospective studies comparing between laparoscopic and open major 
      hepatectomies published until March 2017 were identified independently by 2 
      reviewers by searching in PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. 
      Individual patient data were sought from all selected studies. Postoperative 
      outcomes, including intraoperative blood loss, operative time, hospital stay, 
      postoperative complications, mortality rates, and long-term survival were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: A total of 917 patients were divided into the laparoscopic (427) and open 
      (490) groups from 8 selected studies. The hospital stay was significantly shorter, 
      and the total morbidity was lower in the laparoscopic group. When classified by 
      severity, the incidence of postoperative minor complications was lower; however, 
      that of major complications was not significantly different. The operative time was 
      longer in the laparoscopic group; however, intraoperative blood loss, perioperative 
      mortality, and blood transfusions were comparable between the 2 groups. The overall 
      survival in the patients with colorectal liver metastases and hepatocellular 
      carcinoma was not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: 
      Laparoscopic major hepatectomies offer some perioperative advantages, including 
      fewer complications and shorter hospital stay, without increasing the blood loss 
      volume and mortality. Whether these results can anticipate the outcomes in future 
      randomized controlled trials has not been determined.

TI  - Fractional flow reserve-guided percutaneous coronary intervention vs. medical

      patient data.
PG  - 180-186
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehy812 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To assess the effect of fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided percutaneous 
      coronary intervention (PCI) with contemporary drug-eluting stents on the composite 
      of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (MI) vs. medical therapy in patients with 
      stable coronary lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) of the three available randomized 
      trials of contemporary FFR-guided PCI vs. medical therapy for patients with stable 
      coronary lesions: FAME 2 (NCT01132495), DANAMI-3-PRIMULTI (NCT01960933), and 
      Compare-Acute (NCT01399736). FAME 2 enrolled patients with stable coronary artery 
      disease (CAD), while the other two focused on non-culprit lesions in stabilized 
      patients after acute coronary syndrome. A total of 2400 subjects were recruited from 
      54 sites world-wide with 1056 randomly assigned to FFR-guided PCI and 1344 to 
      medical therapy. The pre-specified primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death 
      or MI. We included data from extended follow-ups for FAME 2 (up to 5.5 years 
      follow-up) and DANAMI-3-PRIMULTI (up to 4.7 years follow-up). After a median 
      follow-up of 35 months (interquartile range 12-60 months), a reduction in the 
      composite of cardiac death or MI was observed with FFR-guided PCI as compared with 
      medical therapy (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.54-0.96; P = 0.02). 
      The difference between groups was driven by MI. CONCLUSION: In this IPD 
      meta-analysis of the three available randomized controlled trials to date, 
      FFR-guided PCI resulted in a reduction of the composite of cardiac death or MI 
      compared with medical therapy, which was driven by a decreased risk of MI.

TI  - Changes in Kidney Function Do Not Differ between Healthy Adults Consuming Higher- 
      Compared with Lower- or Normal-Protein Diets: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1760-1775
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxy197 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Higher-protein (HP) diets are advocated for several reasons, including 
      mitigation of sarcopenia, but their effects on kidney function are unclear. 
      OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect of HP intakes on 
      kidney function in healthy adults. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of trials comparing HP (≥1.5 g/kg body weight or ≥20% energy intake or 
      ≥100 g protein/d) with normal- or lower-protein (NLP; ≥5% less energy intake from 
      protein/d compared with HP group) intakes on kidney function. Medline and EMBASE 
      databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of HP 
      with NLP (>4 d duration) intakes on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in adults 
      without kidney disease were included. RESULTS: A total of 2144 abstracts were 
      reviewed, with 40 articles selected for full-text review; 28 of these were analyzed 
      and included data from 1358 participants. Data were analyzed using random-effects 
      meta-analysis (RevMan 5; The Cochrane Collaboration), meta-regression (STATA; 
      StataCorp), and dose-response analysis (Prism; GraphPad). Analyses were conducted 
      using postintervention (post) GFR and the change in GFR from preintervention to 
      post. The post-only comparison showed a trivial effect for GFR to be higher after HP 
      intakes [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.19; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.31; P = 0.002]. 
      The change in GFR did not differ between interventions (SMD: 0.11; 95% CI: -0.05, 
      0.27; P = 0.16). There was a linear relation between protein intake and GFR in the 
      post-only comparison (r = 0.332, P = 0.03), but not between protein intake and the 
      change in GFR (r = 0.184, P = 0.33). The main limitation of the current analysis is 
      the unclear risk of selection bias of the included trials. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Postintervention GFR comparisons indicate that HP diets result in higher GFRs; 
      however, when changes in GFR were compared, dietary protein had no effect. Our 
      analysis indicates that HP intakes do not adversely influence kidney function on GFR 
      in healthy adults.

TI  - Blood pressure-lowering treatment strategies based on cardiovascular risk versus 
      blood pressure: A meta-analysis of individual participant data.
PG  - e1002538
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002538 [doi]
LID - e1002538
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines have traditionally recommended blood 
      pressure treatment based primarily on blood pressure thresholds. In contrast, using 
      predicted cardiovascular risk has been advocated as a more effective strategy to 
      guide treatment decisions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. We aimed to 
      compare outcomes from a blood pressure-lowering treatment strategy based on 
      predicted cardiovascular risk with one based on systolic blood pressure (SBP) level. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used individual participant data from the Blood Pressure 
      Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (BPLTTC) from 1995 to 2013. Trials 
      randomly assigned participants to either blood pressure-lowering drugs versus 
      placebo or more intensive versus less intensive blood pressure-lowering regimens. We 
      estimated 5-y risk of CVD events using a multivariable Weibull model previously 
      developed in this dataset. We compared the two strategies at specific SBP thresholds 
      and across the spectrum of risk and blood pressure levels studied in BPLTTC trials. 
      The primary outcome was number of CVD events avoided per persons treated. We 
      included data from 11 trials (47,872 participants). During a median of 4.0 y of 
      follow-up, 3,566 participants (7.5%) experienced a major cardiovascular event. Areas 
      under the curve comparing the two treatment strategies throughout the range of 
      possible thresholds for CVD risk and SBP demonstrated that, on average, a greater 
      number of CVD events would be avoided for a given number of persons treated with the 
      CVD risk strategy compared with the SBP strategy (area under the curve 0.71 [95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.72] for the CVD risk strategy versus 0.54 [95% CI 
      0.53-0.55] for the SBP strategy). Compared with treating everyone with SBP ≥ 150 
      mmHg, a CVD risk strategy would require treatment of 29% (95% CI 26%-31%) fewer 
      persons to prevent the same number of events or would prevent 16% (95% CI 14%-18%) 
      more events for the same number of persons treated. Compared with treating everyone 
      with SBP ≥ 140 mmHg, a CVD risk strategy would require treatment of 3.8% (95% CI 
      12.5% fewer to 7.2% more) fewer persons to prevent the same number of events or 
      would prevent 3.1% (95% CI 1.5%-5.0%) more events for the same number of persons 
      treated, although the former estimate was not statistically significant. In subgroup 
      analyses, the CVD risk strategy did not appear to be more beneficial than the SBP 
      strategy in patients with diabetes mellitus or established CVD. CONCLUSIONS: A blood 
      pressure-lowering treatment strategy based on predicted cardiovascular risk is more 
      effective than one based on blood pressure levels alone across a range of 
      thresholds. These results support using cardiovascular risk assessment to guide 
      blood pressure treatment decision-making in moderate- to high-risk individuals, 
      particularly for primary prevention.

TI  - Effect of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment on mortality in acute 
      respiratory infections: a patient level meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In February, 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the 
      blood infection marker procalcitonin for guiding antibiotic therapy in patients with 
      acute respiratory infections. This meta-analysis of patient data from 26 randomised 
      controlled trials was designed to assess safety of procalcitonin-guided treatment in 
      patients with acute respiratory infections from different clinical settings. 
      METHODS: Based on a prespecified Cochrane protocol, we did a systematic literature 
      search on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase, 
      and pooled individual patient data from trials in which patients with respiratory 
      infections were randomly assigned to receive antibiotics based on procalcitonin 
      concentrations (procalcitonin-guided group) or control. The coprimary endpoints were 
      30-day mortality and setting-specific treatment failure. Secondary endpoints were 
      antibiotic use, length of stay, and antibiotic side-effects. FINDINGS: We identified 
      990 records from the literature search, of which 71 articles were assessed for 
      eligibility after exclusion of 919 records. We collected data on 6708 patients from 
      26 eligible trials in 12 countries. Mortality at 30 days was significantly lower in 
      procalcitonin-guided patients than in control patients (286 [9%] deaths in 3336 
      procalcitonin-guided patients vs 336 [10%] in 3372 controls; adjusted odds ratio 
      [OR] 0·83 [95% CI 0·70 to 0·99], p=0·037). This mortality benefit was similar across 
      subgroups by setting and type of infection (p(interactions)>0·05), although 
      mortality was very low in primary care and in patients with acute bronchitis. 
      Procalcitonin guidance was also associated with a 2·4-day reduction in antibiotic 
      exposure (5·7 vs 8·1 days [95% CI -2·71 to -2·15], p<0·0001) and a reduction in 
      antibiotic-related side-effects (16% vs 22%, adjusted OR 0·68 [95% CI 0·57 to 0·82], 
      p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Use of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic treatment in 
      patients with acute respiratory infections reduces antibiotic exposure and 
      side-effects, and improves survival. Widespread implementation of procalcitonin 
      protocols in patients with acute respiratory infections thus has the potential to 
      improve antibiotic management with positive effects on clinical outcomes and on the 
      current threat of increasing antibiotic multiresistance. FUNDING: National Institute 
      for Health Research.

TI  - Adjuvant chemotherapy after preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and surgery for 
      patients with rectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual 
      patient data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with rectal cancer after 
      preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and surgery is uncertain. We did a meta-analysis of 
      individual patient data to compare adjuvant chemotherapy with observation for 
      patients with rectal cancer. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of 
      Science, the Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, and conference abstracts to identify 
      European randomised, controlled, phase 3 trials comparing observation with adjuvant 
      chemotherapy after preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and surgery for patients with 
      non-metastatic rectal cancer. The primary endpoint of interest was overall survival. 
      FINDINGS: We analysed data from four eligible trials, including data from 1196 
      patients with (y)pTNM stage II or III disease, who had an R0 resection, had a low 
      anterior resection or an abdominoperineal resection, and had a tumour located within 
      15 cm of the anal verge. We found no significant differences in overall survival 
      between patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and those who underwent 
      observation (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.81-1.17; p=0.775); there were no 
      significant differences in overall survival in subgroup analyses. Overall, adjuvant 
      chemotherapy did not significantly improve disease-free survival (HR 0.91, 95% CI 
      0.77-1.07; p=0.230) or distant recurrences (0.94, 0.78-1.14; p=0.523) compared with 
      observation. However, in subgroup analyses, patients with a tumour 10-15 cm from the 
      anal verge had improved disease-free survival (0.59, 0.40-0.85; p=0.005, 
      p(interaction)=0.107) and fewer distant recurrences (0.61, 0.40-0.94; p=0.025, 
      p(interaction)=0.126) when treated with adjuvant chemotherapy compared with patients 
      undergoing observation. INTERPRETATION: Overall, adjuvant fluorouracil-based 
      chemotherapy did not improve overall survival, disease-free survival, or distant 
      recurrences. However, adjuvant chemotherapy might benefit patients with a tumour 
      10-15 cm from the anal verge in terms of disease-free survival and distant 
      recurrence. Further studies of preoperative and postoperative treatment for this 
      subgroup of patients are warranted. FUNDING: None.

TI  - Geriatric assessment predicts survival and toxicities in elderly myeloma patients: 
      an International Myeloma Working Group report.
PG  - 2068-74
LID - 10.1182/blood-2014-12-615187 [doi]
AB  - We conducted a pooled analysis of 869 individual newly diagnosed elderly patient 
      data from 3 prospective trials. At diagnosis, a geriatric assessment had been 
      performed. An additive scoring system (range 0-5), based on age, comorbidities, and 
      cognitive and physical conditions, was developed to identify 3 groups: fit (score = 
      0, 39%), intermediate fitness (score = 1, 31%), and frail (score ≥2, 30%). The 
      3-year overall survival was 84% in fit, 76% in intermediate-fitness (hazard ratio 
      [HR], 1.61; P = .042), and 57% in frail (HR, 3.57; P < .001) patients. The 
      cumulative incidence of grade ≥3 nonhematologic adverse events at 12 months was 
      22.2% in fit, 26.4% in intermediate-fitness (HR, 1.23; P = .217), and 34.0% in frail 
      (HR, 1.74; P < .001) patients. The cumulative incidence of treatment discontinuation 
      at 12 months was 16.5% in fit, 20.8% in intermediate-fitness (HR, 1.41; P = .052), 
      and 31.2% in frail (HR, 2.21; P < .001) patients. Our frailty score predicts 
      mortality and the risk of toxicity in elderly myeloma patients. The International 
      Myeloma Working group proposes this score for the measurement of frailty in 
      designing future clinical trials. These trials are registered at 
      www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01093136 (EMN01), #NCT01190787 (26866138MMY2069), and 
      #NCT01346787 (IST-CAR-506).

TI  - Three, six, or twelve months of dual antiplatelet therapy after DES implantation in 
      patients with or without acute coronary syndromes: an individual patient data 
      pairwise and network meta-analysis of six randomized trials and 11 473 patients.
PG  - 1034-1043
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehw627 [doi]
AB  - AIM: We sought to determine whether the optimal dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) 
      duration after drug-eluting stent (DES) placement varies according to clinical 
      presentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed an individual patient data pairwise 
      and network meta-analysis comparing short-term (≤6-months) versus long-term (1-year) 
      DAPT as well as 3-month vs. 6-month vs 1-year DAPT. The primary study outcome was 
      the 1-year composite risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or definite/probable stent 
      thrombosis (ST). Six trials were included in which DAPT after DES consisted of 
      aspirin and clopidogrel. Among 11 473 randomized patients 6714 (58.5%) had stable 
      CAD and 4758 (41.5%) presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the majority of 
      whom (67.0%) had unstable angina. In ACS patients, ≤6-month DAPT was associated with 
      non-significantly higher 1-year rates of MI or ST compared with 1-year DAPT (Hazard 
      Ratio (HR) 1.48, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 0.98-2.22; P = 0.059), whereas in 
      stable patients rates of MI and ST were similar between the two DAPT strategies (HR 
      0.93, 95%CI 0.65-1.35; P = 0.71; Pinteraction = 0.09). By network meta-analysis, 
      3-month DAPT, but not 6-month DAPT, was associated with higher rates of MI or ST in 
      ACS, whereas no significant differences were apparent in stable patients. Short DAPT 
      was associated with lower rates of major bleeding compared with 1-year DAPT, 
      irrespective of clinical presentation. All-cause mortality was not significantly 
      different with short vs. long DAPT in both patients with stable CAD and ACS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Optimal DAPT duration after DES differs according to clinical 
      presentation. In the present meta-analysis, despite the fact that most enrolled ACS 
      patients were relatively low risk, 3-month DAPT was associated with increased 
      ischaemic risk, whereas 3-month DAPT appeared safe in stable CAD. Prolonged DAPT 
      increases bleeding regardless of clinical presentation. Further study is required to 
      identify the optimal duration of DAPT after DES in individual patients based on 
      their relative ischaemic and bleeding risks.

TI  - Zinc acetate lozenges for treating the common cold: an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1393-1398
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13057 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine whether the allergy status and other 
      characteristics of common cold patients modify the effects of zinc acetate lozenges. 
      METHODS: We had available individual patient data for three randomized 
      placebo-controlled trials in which zinc acetate lozenges were administered to common 
      cold patients. We used both one stage and two stage meta-analysis to estimate the 
      effects of zinc lozenges. RESULTS: The total number of common cold patients was 199, 
      the majority being females. Eighty percent of them fell into the age range 
      20-50 years. One third of the patients had allergies. The one stage meta-analysis 
      gave an overall estimate of 2.73 days (95% CI 1.8, 3.3 days) shorter colds by zinc 
      acetate lozenge usage. The two stage meta-analysis gave an estimate of 2.94 days 
      (95% CI 2.1, 3.8 days) reduction in common cold duration. These estimates are to be 
      compared with the 7 day average duration of colds in the three trials. The effect of 
      zinc lozenges was not modified by allergy status, smoking, baseline severity of the 
      common cold, age, gender or ethnic group. CONCLUSION: Since the effects of zinc 
      acetate lozenges were consistent between the compared subgroups, the overall 
      estimates for effect seemed applicable over a wide range of common cold patients. 
      While the optimal composition of zinc lozenges and the best frequency of their 
      administration should be further investigated, given the current evidence of 
      efficacy, common cold patients may be encouraged to try zinc lozenges for treating 
      their colds.

TI  - Percutaneous Coronary Intervention vs Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Patients 
      With Left Main Coronary Artery Stenosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1079-1088
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2017.2895 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: In patients with left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis, coronary 
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been the standard therapy for several decades. 
      However, some studies suggest that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with 
      drug-eluting stents may be an acceptable alternative. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 
      long-term safety of PCI with drug-eluting stent vs CABG in patients with LMCA 
      stenosis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and ScienceDirect 
      databases were searched from December 18, 2001, to February 1, 2017. Inclusion 
      criteria were randomized clinical trial, patients with LMCA stenosis, PCI vs CABG, 
      exclusive use of drug-eluting stents, and clinical follow-up of 3 or more years. 
      DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Trial-level hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were 
      pooled by fixed-effect and random-effects models with inverse variance weighting. 
      Time-to-event individual patient data for the primary end point were reconstructed. 
      Sensitivity analyses according to drug-eluting stent generation and coronary artery 
      disease complexity were performed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point 
      was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at long-term 
      follow-up. Secondary end points included repeat revascularization and a composite of 
      all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascularization at 
      long-term follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 4 randomized clinical trials were pooled; 
      4394 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 3371 (76.7%) were men; pooled 
      mean age was 65.4 years. According to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 
      Development and Evaluation, evidence quality with respect to the primary composite 
      end point was high. Percutaneous coronary intervention and CABG were associated with 
      a comparable risk of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke both by 
      fixed-effect (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90-1.24; P = .48) and random-effects (HR, 1.06; 
      95% CI, 0.85-1.32; P = .60) analysis. Sensitivity analyses according to low to 
      intermediate Synergy Between PCI With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score 
      (random-effects: HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.74-1.41; P = .89) and drug-eluting stent 
      generation (first generation: HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.68-1.20; P = .49; second 
      generation: HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.82-1.73; P = .36) were consistent. Kaplan-Meier 
      curve reconstruction did not show significant variations over time between the 
      techniques, with a 5-year incidence of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or 
      stroke of 18.3% (319 events) in patients treated with PCI and 16.9% (292 events) in 
      patients treated with CABG. However, repeat revascularization after PCI was 
      increased (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.42-2.05; P < .001). Other individual secondary end 
      points did not differ significantly between groups. Finally, pooled estimates of 
      trials with LMCA stenosis tended overall to differ significantly from those of 
      trials with multivessel coronary artery disease without left main LMCA stenosis. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Percutaneous coronary intervention and CABG show 
      comparable safety in patients with LMCA stenosis and low to intermediate-complexity 
      coronary artery disease. However, repeat revascularization is more common after PCI.

TI  - Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of individual 
      participant data: the PRISMA-IPD Statement.
PG  - 1657-65
LID - 10.1001/jama.2015.3656 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of individual participant data 
      (IPD) aim to collect, check, and reanalyze individual-level data from all studies 
      addressing a particular research question and are therefore considered a gold 
      standard approach to evidence synthesis. They are likely to be used with increasing 
      frequency as current initiatives to share clinical trial data gain momentum and may 
      be particularly important in reviewing controversial therapeutic areas. OBJECTIVE: 
      To develop PRISMA-IPD as a stand-alone extension to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement, tailored to the specific 
      requirements of reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of IPD. Although 
      developed primarily for reviews of randomized trials, many items will apply in other 
      contexts, including reviews of diagnosis and prognosis. DESIGN: Development of 
      PRISMA-IPD followed the EQUATOR Network framework guidance and used the existing 
      standard PRISMA Statement as a starting point to draft additional relevant material. 
      A web-based survey informed discussion at an international workshop that included 
      researchers, clinicians, methodologists experienced in conducting systematic reviews 
      and meta-analyses of IPD, and journal editors. The statement was drafted and 
      iterative refinements were made by the project, advisory, and development groups. 
      The PRISMA-IPD Development Group reached agreement on the PRISMA-IPD checklist and 
      flow diagram by consensus. FINDINGS: Compared with standard PRISMA, the PRISMA-IPD 
      checklist includes 3 new items that address (1) methods of checking the integrity of 
      the IPD (such as pattern of randomization, data consistency, baseline imbalance, and 
      missing data), (2) reporting any important issues that emerge, and (3) exploring 
      variation (such as whether certain types of individual benefit more from the 
      intervention than others). A further additional item was created by reorganization 
      of standard PRISMA items relating to interpreting results. Wording was modified in 
      23 items to reflect the IPD approach. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: PRISMA-IPD provides 
      guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of IPD.

TI  - Initial severity of major depression and efficacy of new generation antidepressants: 
      individual participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - 450-458
LID - 10.1111/acps.12886 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The role of baseline severity as effect modifier in various psychiatric 
      disorders is a topic of controversy and of clinical import. This study aims to 
      examine whether baseline severity modifies the efficacy of various antidepressants 
      for major depression through individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. 
      METHOD: We identified all placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised trials of new 
      generation antidepressants in the acute phase treatment of major depression 
      conducted in Japan and requested their IPD through the public-private partnerships 
      (PPPs) between the relevant academic societies and the pharmaceutical companies. The 
      effect modification by baseline depression severity was examined through six 
      increasingly complex competing mixed-effects models for repeated measures. RESULTS: 
      We identified eleven eligible trials and obtained IPD from six, which compared 
      duloxetine, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine or bupropion against placebo 
      (total n = 2464). The best-fitting model revealed that the interaction between 
      baseline severity and treatment was not statistically significant (coefficient = 
      -0.04, 95% confidence interval: -0.16 to 0.08, P = 0.49). Several sensitivity 
      analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings. CONCLUSION: We may expect as much 
      benefit from antidepressant treatments for mild, moderate or severe major 
      depression. Clinical practice guidelines will need to take these findings into 
      consideration.

TI  - Corticosteroids Reduce Risk of Death Within 28 Days for Patients With Severe 
      Alcoholic Hepatitis, Compared With Pentoxifylline or Placebo-a Meta-analysis of 
      Individual Data From Controlled Trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 
      randomized controlled trials comparing corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, or their 
      combination in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. We compared the effects of 
      the treatments on survival for 28 days or 6 months, and response to treatment based 
      on the Lille model. METHODS: We searched PubMed for randomized controlled trials of 
      pharmacologic therapy for severe alcoholic hepatitis. Our final analysis comprised 
      11 studies, of 2111 patients. We performed 4 meta-analyses of the effects of 
      corticosteroids vs placebo or control, corticosteroids vs pentoxifylline, 
      corticosteroids and pentoxifylline vs corticosteroids and placebo or control, and 
      pentoxifylline vs placebo. In each meta-analysis, the effect of treatment on the 
      primary outcome (overall survival at 28 days, defined as the period from the first 
      day of assigned treatment to 28 days) was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards 
      regression model, including trials as random effect. RESULTS: Corticosteroid 
      treatment significantly decreased risk of death within 28 days compared with 
      controls (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48-0.86) or to 
      pentoxifylline (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.43-0.95). In multiple-imputation and complete case 
      analyses, the effect of corticosteroids compared with controls remained significant. 
      When we compared corticosteroids vs pentoxifylline, the corticosteroid effect 
      remained significant in the complete case analysis (HR 0.66; P = .04) but not in 
      multiple-imputation analysis (HR 0.71; P = .08). There was no difference in 28-day 
      mortality when patients were given a combination of corticosteroids and 
      pentoxifylline vs corticosteroids alone or between patients given pentoxifylline vs 
      control. In our analysis of secondary outcomes, we found no significant differences 
      in 6-month mortality when any treatments or controls were compared. Corticosteroids 
      were significantly associated with increased response to therapy compared with 
      controls (relative risk 1.24; 95% CI 1.10-1.41) or pentoxifylline (relative risk 
      1.43; 95% CI 1.20-1.68). We found no difference in response to therapy between 
      patients given a combination of corticosteroids and pentoxifylline vs 
      corticosteroids alone or pentoxifylline vs controls. CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis 
      of 4 controlled trials, we found corticosteroid use to reduce risk of death within 
      28 days of treatment, but not in the following 6 months. This loss of efficacy over 
      time indicates a need for new therapeutic strategies to improve medium-term 
      outcomes.

TI  - The symptom-specific efficacy of antidepressant medication vs. cognitive behavioral 
      therapy in the treatment of depression: results from an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 183-191
LID - 10.1002/wps.20630 [doi]
AB  - A recent individual patient data meta-analysis showed that antidepressant medication 
      is slightly more efficacious than cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing 
      overall depression severity in patients with a DSM-defined depressive disorder. We 
      used an update of that dataset, based on seventeen randomized clinical trials, to 
      examine the comparative efficacy of antidepressant medication vs. CBT in more detail 
      by focusing on individual depressive symptoms as assessed with the 17-item Hamilton 
      Rating Scale for Depression. Five symptoms (i.e., "depressed mood" , "feelings of 
      guilt" , "suicidal thoughts" , "psychic anxiety" and "general somatic symptoms") 
      showed larger improvements in the medication compared to the CBT condition (effect 
      sizes ranging from .13 to .16), whereas no differences were found for the twelve 
      other symptoms. In addition, network estimation techniques revealed that all 
      effects, except that on "depressed mood" , were direct and could not be explained by 
      any of the other direct or indirect treatment effects. Exploratory analyses showed 
      that information about the symptom-specific efficacy could help in identifying those 
      patients who, based on their pre-treatment symptomatology, are likely to benefit 
      more from antidepressant medication than from CBT (effect size of .30) versus those 
      for whom both treatments are likely to be equally efficacious. Overall, our 
      symptom-oriented approach results in a more thorough evaluation of the efficacy of 
      antidepressant medication over CBT and shows potential in "precision psychiatry" .

PG  - CD000219
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD000219.pub4 [doi]
LID - CD000219
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in early 
      infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for AOM varies from 56% in the Netherlands to 
      95% in the USA, Canada and Australia. This is an update of a Cochrane review first 
      published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 1997 and previously updated in 1999, 
      2005, 2009 and 2013. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antibiotics for children 
      with AOM. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to 
      April week 3, 2015), OLDMEDLINE (1958 to 1965), EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2015), 
      Current Contents (1966 to April 2015), CINAHL (2008 to April 2015) and LILACS (2008 
      to April 2015). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 1) 
      antimicrobial drugs with placebo and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with 
      expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with 
      AOM. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial 
      quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: For the review of antibiotics against 
      placebo, 13 RCTs (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries 
      were eligible and had generally low risk of bias. The combined results of the trials 
      revealed that by 24 hours from the start of treatment, 60% of the children had 
      recovered whether or not they had placebo or antibiotics. Pain was not reduced by 
      antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 
      1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70, 95% 
      CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 
      20). A quarter fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91; 
      NNTB 16) and two-thirds fewer had pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 
      0.66; NNTB 7) compared with placebo. Antibiotics did reduce the number of children 
      with abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 
      0.90; NNTB 11), at six to eight weeks (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; NNTB 16) and 
      the number of children with tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 
      0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 
      0.95; NNTB 11) compared with placebo. However, antibiotics neither reduced the 
      number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at three months (RR 0.97, 95% 
      CI 0.76 to 1.24) nor the number of children with late AOM recurrences (RR 0.93, 95% 
      CI 0.78 to 1.10) when compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did 
      not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo. 
      Adverse events (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) occurred more often in children 
      taking antibiotics (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.59; number needed to treat for an 
      additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14). Funnel plots do not suggest publication bias. 
      Individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of included trials found 
      antibiotics to be most beneficial in children aged less than two years with 
      bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea.For the review of immediate 
      antibiotics against expectant observation, five trials (1149 children) from 
      high-income countries were eligible and had low to moderate risk of bias. Four 
      trials (1007 children) reported outcome data that could be used for this review. 
      From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis 
      of pain at three to seven days. No difference in pain was detectable at three to 
      seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12). One trial (247 children) reported data on 
      pain at 11 to 14 days. Immediate antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in 
      the number of children with pain (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10) compared with 
      expectant observation. Additionally, no differences in the number of children with 
      abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks, tympanic membrane perforations and AOM 
      recurrence were observed between groups. No serious complications occurred in either 
      the antibiotic or the expectant observation group. Immediate antibiotics were 
      associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash compared 
      with expectant observation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36; NNTH 9).Results from an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis including data from six high-quality trials 
      (1643 children) that were also included as individual trials in our review showed 
      that antibiotics seem to be most beneficial in children younger than two years of 
      age with bilateral AOM (NNTB 4) and in children with both AOM and otorrhoea (NNTB 
      3). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals that antibiotics have no early effect 
      on pain, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on 
      the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and 
      abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks and at six to eight weeks 
      compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of 
      AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be 
      weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics 
      one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that 
      would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. Therefore clinical management 
      should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for 
      antibiotics. Antibiotics are most useful in children under two years of age with 
      bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild 
      disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems 
      justified.

LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.024497 [doi]
AB  - Background and Purpose- We assessed the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet agents 
      after noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack and examined how these 
      vary according to patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods- We 
      did a network meta-analysis (NMA) of data from 6 randomized trials of the effects of 
      commonly prescribed antiplatelet agents in the long-term (≥3 months) secondary 
      prevention of noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Individual 
      patient data from 43 112 patients were pooled and reanalyzed. Main outcomes were 
      serious vascular events (nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or 
      vascular death), major bleeding, and net clinical benefit (serious vascular event or 
      major bleeding). Subgroup analyses were done according to age, sex, ethnicity, 
      hypertension, qualifying diagnosis, type of vessel involved (large versus small 
      vessel disease), and time from qualifying event to randomization. Results- 
      Aspirin/dipyridamole combination (RR(NMA-adj), 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94) 
      significantly reduced the risk of vascular events compared with aspirin, as did 
      clopidogrel (RR(NMA-adj), 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.98), and aspirin/clopidogrel 
      combination (RR(NMA-adj), 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.96). Clopidogrel caused significantly 
      less major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage than aspirin, aspirin/dipyridamole 
      combination, and aspirin/clopidogrel combination. Aspirin/clopidogrel combination 
      caused significantly more major bleeding than aspirin, aspirin/dipyridamole 
      combination, and clopidogrel. Net clinical benefit was similar for clopidogrel and 
      aspirin/dipyridamole combination (RR(NMA-adj), 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93-1.05). Subgroup 
      analyses showed no heterogeneity of treatment effectiveness across prespecified 
      subgroups. The excess risk of major bleeding associated with aspirin/clopidogrel 
      combination compared with clopidogrel alone was higher in patients aged <65 years 
      than it was in patients ≥65 years (RR(NMA-adj), 3.9 versus 1.7). Conclusions- 
      Results favor clopidogrel and aspirin/dipyridamole combination for long-term 
      secondary prevention after noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack, 
      regardless of patient characteristics. Aspirin/clopidogrel combination was 
      associated with a significantly higher risk of major bleeding compared with other 
      antiplatelet regimens.

TI  - Corticosteroids in Patients Hospitalized With Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 
      Systematic Review and Individual Patient Data Metaanalysis.
PG  - 346-354
LID - 10.1093/cid/cix801 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to evaluate the benefits and harms of adjunctive 
      corticosteroids in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using 
      individual patient data from randomized, placebo-controlled trials and to explore 
      subgroup differences. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane 
      Central, and trial registers (all through July 2017). Data from 1506 individual 
      patients in 6 trials were analyzed using uniform outcome definitions. We 
      investigated prespecified effect modifiers using multivariable hierarchical 
      regression, adjusting for pneumonia severity, age, and clustering effects. RESULTS: 
      Within 30 days of randomization, 37 of 748 patients (5.0%) assigned to 
      corticosteroids and 45 of 758 patients (5.9%) assigned to placebo died (adjusted 
      odds ratio [aOR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], .46 to 1.21; P &#x003D; .24). 
      Time to clinical stability and length of hospital stay were reduced by approximately 
      1 day with corticosteroids (-1.03 days; 95% CI, -1.62 to -.43; P &#x003D; .001 and 
      -1.15 days; 95% CI, -1.75 to -.55; P < .001, respectively). More patients with 
      corticosteroids had hyperglycemia (160 [22.1%] vs 88 [12.0%]; aOR, 2.15; 95% CI, 
      1.60 to 2.90; P < .001) and CAP-related rehospitalization (33 [5.0%] vs 18 [2.7%]; 
      aOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.32; P &#x003D; .04). We did not find significant effect 
      modification by CAP severity or degree of inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunct 
      corticosteroids for patients hospitalized with CAP reduce time to clinical stability 
      and length of hospital stay by approximately 1 day without a significant effect on 
      overall mortality but with an increased risk for CAP-related rehospitalization and 
      hyperglycemia.

TI  - Gefitinib or Erlotinib vs Chemotherapy for EGFR Mutation-Positive Lung Cancer: 
      Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis of Overall Survival.
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djw279 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis to examine the 
      impact of first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor (TKI) therapy on overall survival (OS) in advanced non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Data from trials comparing EGFR-TKI against chemotherapy in 
      exon 19 deletion (del19) or exon 21 L858R (L858R) EGFR mutations patients were used. 
      We performed Cox regression to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs). Impact of postprogression therapies was examined in exploratory 
      analyses. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Six eligible trials 
      (gefitinib = 3, erlotinib = 3) included 1231 patients; 632 received EGFR-TKI and 599 
      received chemotherapy. At a median 35.0 months follow-up, there were 780 deaths and 
      1004 progressions. There was no difference in OS between EGFR-TKI and chemotherapy 
      (HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.17, P =  .84). There was also no difference in OS for 
      Del19 (n = 682, HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.16, P =  .68) and L858R (n = 540, 
      HR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.86 to 1.32, P =  .59) subgroups ( P interaction = .47), or 
      according to smoking status, sex, performance status, age, ethnicity, or histology. 
      However, EGFR-TKI statistically significantly prolonged progression-free survival 
      (PFS) overall (HR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.42, P <  .001) and in all subgroups. 
      Following progression, 73.8% from the chemotherapy arm received EGFR-TKI, and 65.9% 
      from the EGFR-TKI arm received chemotherapy. Nine percent from the EGFR-TKI arm 
      received no further treatment vs 0.6% from the chemotherapy arm. Following disease 
      progression, patients randomly assigned to EGFR-TKI had shorter OS than those 
      randomly assigned to chemotherapy (12.8 months, 95% CI = 11.4 to 14.3, vs 19.8 
      months, 95% CI = 17.6 to 21.7). CONCLUSIONS: Despite statistically significant PFS 
      benefit, there is no relative OS advantage with frontline gefitinib or erlotinib vs 
      chemotherapy in EGFR -mutated NSCLC. This finding is likely due to the high rate of 
      crossover at progression.

TI  - The Relation Between Thyroid Function and Anemia: A Pooled Analysis of Individual 
      Participant Data.
PG  - 3658-3667
LID - 10.1210/jc.2018-00481 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Anemia and thyroid dysfunction often co-occur, and both increase with age. 
      Human data on relationships between thyroid disease and anemia are scarce. 
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between 
      clinical thyroid status and anemia. DESIGN: Individual participant data 
      meta-analysis. SETTING: Sixteen cohorts participating in the Thyroid Studies 
      Collaboration (n = 42,162). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was 
      anemia (hemoglobin <130 g/L in men and <120 g/L in women). RESULTS: 
      Cross-sectionally, participants with abnormal thyroid status had an increased risk 
      of having anemia compared with euthyroid participants [overt hypothyroidism, pooled 
      OR 1.84 (95% CI 1.35 to 2.50), subclinical hypothyroidism 1.21 (1.02 to 1.43), 
      subclinical hyperthyroidism 1.27 (1.03 to 1.57), and overt hyperthyroidism 1.69 
      (1.00 to 2.87)]. Hemoglobin levels were lower in all groups compared with 
      participants with euthyroidism. In the longitudinal analyses (n = 25,466 from 14 
      cohorts), the pooled hazard ratio for the risk of development of anemia was 1.38 
      (95% CI 0.86 to 2.20) for overt hypothyroidism, 1.18 (1.00 to 1.38) for subclinical 
      hypothyroidism, 1.15 (0.94 to 1.42) for subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 1.47 (0.91 
      to 2.38) for overt hyperthyroidism. Sensitivity analyses excluding thyroid 
      medication or high levels of C-reactive protein yielded similar results. No 
      differences in mean annual change in hemoglobin levels were observed between the 
      thyroid hormone status groups. CONCLUSION: Higher odds of having anemia were 
      observed in participants with both hypothyroid function and hyperthyroid function. 
      In addition, reduced thyroid function at baseline showed a trend of increased risk 
      of developing anemia during follow-up. It remains to be assessed in a randomized 
      controlled trial whether treatment is effective in reducing anemia.

TI  - Oral Anticoagulation and Functional Outcome after Intracerebral Hemorrhage.
PG  - 755-765
LID - 10.1002/ana.25079 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral anticoagulation treatment (OAT) resumption is a therapeutic dilemma 
      in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) care, particularly for lobar hemorrhages related 
      to amyloid angiopathy. We sought to determine whether OAT resumption after ICH is 
      associated with long-term outcome, accounting for ICH location (ie, lobar vs 
      nonlobar). METHODS: We meta-analyzed individual patient data from: (1) the 
      multicenter RETRACE study (n = 542), (2) a U.S.-based single-center ICH study (n = 
      261), and (3) the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage study (n = 
      209). We determined whether, within 1 year from ICH, OAT resumption was associated 
      with: (1) mortality, (2) favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale = 0-3), 
      and (3) stroke incidence. We separately analyzed nonlobar and lobar ICH cases using 
      propensity score matching and Cox regression models. RESULTS: We included 1,012 
      OAT-related ICH survivors (633 nonlobar and 379 lobar). Among nonlobar ICH 
      survivors, 178/633 (28%) resumed OAT, whereas 86/379 (23%) lobar ICH survivors did. 
      In multivariate analyses, OAT resumption after nonlobar ICH was associated with 
      decreased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
      0.14-0.44, p < 0.0001) and improved functional outcome (HR = 4.22, 95% CI = 
      2.57-6.94, p < 0.0001). OAT resumption after lobar ICH was also associated with 
      decreased mortality (HR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.17-0.45, p < 0.0001) and favorable 
      functional outcome (HR = 4.08, 95% CI = 2.48-6.72, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, OAT 
      resumption was associated with decreased all-cause stroke incidence in both lobar 
      and nonlobar ICH (both p < 0.01). INTERPRETATION: These results suggest novel 
      evidence of an association between OAT resumption and outcome following ICH, 
      regardless of hematoma location. These findings support conducting randomized trials 
      to explore risks and benefits of OAT resumption after ICH. Ann Neurol 
      2017;82:755-765.

TI  - Does maintenance azithromycin reduce asthma exacerbations? An individual participant 
      data meta-analysis.
LID - 1901381 [pii]
LID - 10.1183/13993003.01381-2019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preventing exacerbations is an important goal of asthma treatment. 
      Long-term treatment with azithromycin may help achieve this. Our aim was to conduct 
      a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to examine 
      the efficacy of azithromycin in reducing exacerbations in asthma, and in the 
      subphenotypes of noneosinophilic asthma, eosinophilic asthma and severe asthma. 
      METHOD: We completed a systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane 
      Library, ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of previous systematic reviews in 
      February 2019. We included parallel-group, double-blind, randomised controlled 
      trials in adults comparing at least 8 weeks of azithromycin treatment with placebo, 
      where the outcome of exacerbations was assessed over at least 6 months. Data were 
      extracted from published sources, Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was applied and IPD 
      were sought from authors. Reviews were undertaken in duplicate. We conducted an IPD 
      meta-analysis on the primary outcome of exacerbations and a random effects 
      meta-analysis for secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Three studies were identified 
      (n=604). In the IPD meta-analysis, treatment with azithromycin was associated with a 
      reduced rate of exacerbations (oral corticosteroid course due to worsening asthma, 
      antibiotic use for lower respiratory tract infection, hospitalisation and/or 
      emergency department visits) in asthma as well as in the noneosinophilic, 
      eosinophilic and severe asthma subgroups. Examining each exacerbation type 
      separately, patients with eosinophilic asthma reported fewer oral corticosteroid 
      courses, and patients with noneosinophilic and severe asthma reported fewer 
      antibiotic courses. Azithromycin was well tolerated. DISCUSSION: Maintenance use of 
      azithromycin reduces exacerbations in patients with eosinophilic, noneosinophilic 
      and severe asthma.

TI  - Estimating the Risks of Breast Cancer Radiotherapy: Evidence From Modern Radiation 
      Doses to the Lungs and Heart and From Previous Randomized Trials.
PG  - 1641-1649
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2016.72.0722 [doi]
AB  - Purpose Radiotherapy reduces the absolute risk of breast cancer mortality by a few 
      percentage points in suitable women but can cause a second cancer or heart disease 
      decades later. We estimated the absolute long-term risks of modern breast cancer 
      radiotherapy. Methods First, a systematic literature review was performed of lung 
      and heart doses in breast cancer regimens published during 2010 to 2015. Second, 
      individual patient data meta-analyses of 40,781 women randomly assigned to breast 
      cancer radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy in 75 trials yielded rate ratios (RRs) 
      for second primary cancers and cause-specific mortality and excess RRs (ERRs) per Gy 
      for incident lung cancer and cardiac mortality. Smoking status was unavailable. 
      Third, the lung or heart ERRs per Gy in the trials and the 2010 to 2015 doses were 
      combined and applied to current smoker and nonsmoker lung cancer and cardiac 
      mortality rates in population-based data. Results Average doses from 647 regimens 
      published during 2010 to 2015 were 5.7 Gy for whole lung and 4.4 Gy for whole heart. 
      The median year of irradiation was 2010 (interquartile range [IQR], 2008 to 2011). 
      Meta-analyses yielded lung cancer incidence ≥ 10 years after radiotherapy RR of 2.10 
      (95% CI, 1.48 to 2.98; P < .001) on the basis of 134 cancers, indicating 0.11 (95% 
      CI, 0.05 to 0.20) ERR per Gy whole-lung dose. For cardiac mortality, RR was 1.30 
      (95% CI, 1.15 to 1.46; P < .001) on the basis of 1,253 cardiac deaths. Detailed 
      analyses indicated 0.04 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.06) ERR per Gy whole-heart dose. 
      Estimated absolute risks from modern radiotherapy were as follows: lung cancer, 
      approximately 4% for long-term continuing smokers and 0.3% for nonsmokers; and 
      cardiac mortality, approximately 1% for smokers and 0.3% for nonsmokers. Conclusion 
      For long-term smokers, the absolute risks of modern radiotherapy may outweigh the 
      benefits, yet for most nonsmokers (and ex-smokers), the benefits of radiotherapy far 
      outweigh the risks. Hence, smoking can determine the net effect of radiotherapy on 
      mortality, but smoking cessation substantially reduces radiotherapy risk.

TI  - Prenatal vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of asthma/recurrent wheeze in early 
      childhood: A combined analysis of two randomized controlled trials.
PG  - e0186657

LID - e0186657
AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently published two independent randomized controlled trials of 
      vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, both indicating a >20% reduced risk of 
      asthma/recurrent wheeze in the offspring by 3 years of age. However, neither reached 
      statistical significance. OBJECTIVE: To perform a combined analysis of the two 
      trials and investigate whether maternal 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) level at 
      trial entry modified the intervention effect. METHODS: VDAART (N = 806) and 
      COPSAC2010. (N = 581) randomized pregnant women to daily high-dose vitamin D3 (4,000 
      IU/d and 2,400 IU/d, respectively) or placebo. All women also received a prenatal 
      vitamin containing 400 IU/d vitamin D3. The primary outcome was asthma/recurrent 
      wheeze from 0-3yrs. Secondary end-points were specific IgE, total IgE, eczema and 
      lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). We conducted random effects combined 
      analyses of the treatment effect, individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses, and 
      analyses stratified by 25(OH)D level at study entry. RESULTS: The analysis showed a 
      25% reduced risk of asthma/recurrent wheeze at 0-3yrs: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 
      0.74 (95% CI, 0.57-0.96), p = 0.02. The effect was strongest among women with 
      25(OH)D level ≥30ng/ml at study entry: aOR = 0.54 (0.33-0.88), p = 0.01, whereas no 
      significant effect was observed among women with 25(OH)D level <30ng/ml at study 
      entry: aOR = 0.84 (0.62-1.15), p = 0.25. The IPD meta-analyses showed similar 
      results. There was no effect on the secondary end-points. CONCLUSIONS: This combined 
      analysis shows that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy results in a 
      significant reduced risk of asthma/recurrent wheeze in the offspring, especially 
      among women with 25(OH)D level ≥ 30 ng/ml at randomization, where the risk was 
      almost halved. Future studies should examine the possibility of raising 25(OH)D 
      levels to at least 30 ng/ml early in pregnancy or using higher doses than used in 
      our studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: COPSAC2010: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00856947; VDAART:

TI  - What Are Effective Program Characteristics of Self-Management Interventions in 
      Patients With Heart Failure? An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify those characteristics of self-management interventions in 
      patients with heart failure (HF) that are effective in influencing health-related 
      quality of life, mortality, and hospitalizations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Randomized 
      trials on self-management interventions conducted between January 1985 and June 2013 
      were identified and individual patient data were requested for meta-analysis. 
      Generalized mixed effects models and Cox proportional hazard models including 
      frailty terms were used to assess the relation between characteristics of 
      interventions and health-related outcomes. Twenty randomized trials (5624 patients) 
      were included. Longer intervention duration reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio 
      0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-0.999 per month increase in duration), risk 
      of HF-related hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-0.99), and HF-related 
      hospitalization at 6 months (risk ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.995). Although results 
      were not consistent across outcomes, interventions comprising standardized training 
      of interventionists, peer contact, log keeping, or goal-setting skills appeared less 
      effective than interventions without these characteristics. CONCLUSION: No specific 
      program characteristics were consistently associated with better effects of 
      self-management interventions, but longer duration seemed to improve the effect of 
      self-management interventions on several outcomes. Future research using factorial 
      trial designs and process evaluations is needed to understand the working mechanism 
      of specific program characteristics of self-management interventions in HF patients.

TI  - Low-molecular-weight heparin and recurrent placenta-mediated pregnancy 
      complications: a meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised controlled 
      trials.
PG  - 2629-2641
LID - S0140-6736(16)31139-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31139-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Placenta-mediated pregnancy complications include pre-eclampsia, late 
      pregnancy loss, placental abruption, and birth of a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) 
      neonate. These complications are leading causes of maternal, fetal, and neonatal 
      morbidity and mortality in high-income countries. Affected women are at high risk of 
      recurrence in subsequent pregnancies; however, effective strategies to prevent 
      recurrence are absent. Findings from our previous study-level meta-analysis 
      suggested that low-molecular-weight heparin reduced the risk of recurrent 
      placenta-mediated pregnancy complications. However, we identified significant 
      heterogeneity in the results, possibly due to trial design or inclusion criteria. To 
      identify which patients benefit from, and which outcomes are prevented by, 
      low-molecular-weight heparin, we did an individual patient data meta-analysis. 
      METHODS: We did a systematic review in May, 2013, which identified eight eligible 
      randomised trials done between 2000 and 2013 of low-molecular-weight heparin to 
      prevent recurrent placenta-mediated pregnancy complications. We excluded studies on 
      the basis of the wrong population, the study being ongoing, inability to confirm 
      eligibility of participants, intervention stopped too early, and no response from 
      the principal investigator. We requested individual patient data from the study 
      authors for eligible women (women pregnant at the time of the study with a history 
      of previous pregnancy that had been complicated by one or more of the following: 
      pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, birth of an SGA neonate [<10th percentile], 
      pregnancy loss after 16 weeks' gestation, or two losses after 12 weeks' gestation) 
      and recoded, combined, and analysed the data for our meta-analysis. The primary 
      outcome was a composite of early-onset (<34 weeks) or severe pre-eclampsia, birth of 
      an SGA neonate (<5th percentile), late pregnancy loss (≥20 weeks' gestation), or 
      placental abruption leading to delivery, assessed on an intention-to-treat basis. We 
      assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. This study is registered 
      with PROSPERO, number CRD42013006249. FINDINGS: We analysed data from 963 eligible 
      women in eight trials: 480 randomly assigned to low-molecular-weight heparin and 483 
      randomly assigned to no low-molecular-weight heparin. Overall, the risk of bias was 
      not substantial enough to affect decisions regarding trial inclusion. Participants 
      were mostly white (795/905; 88%) with a mean age of 30·9 years (SD 5·0) and 403/963 
      (42%) had thrombophilia. In the primary analysis, low-molecular-weight heparin did 
      not significantly reduce the risk of recurrent placenta-mediated pregnancy 
      complications (low-molecular-weight heparin 62/444 [14%] versus no 
      low-molecular-weight heparin 95/443 (22%) absolute difference -8%, 95% CI -17·3 to 
      1·4, p=0·09; relative risk 0·64, 95% CI 0·36-1·11, p=0·11). We noted significant 
      heterogeneity between single-centre and multicentre trials. In subgroup analyses, 
      low-molecular-weight heparin in multicentre trials reduced the primary outcome in 
      women with previous abruption (p=0·006) but not in any of the other subgroups of 
      previous complications. INTERPRETATION: Low-molecular-weight heparin does not seem 
      to reduce the risk of recurrent placenta-mediated pregnancy complications in at-risk 
      women. However, some decreases in event rates might have been too small for the 
      power of our study to explore. FUNDING: Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This protocol for a systematic review describes the methods that will be 
      used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological interventions for 
      patients with dementia. METHODS: We will search ALOIS, the specialized register of 
      the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), without language or 
      publication status restrictions. Additional separate searches will be run in many of 
      the above six databases to ensure the most up-to-date results are retrieved.The 
      study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two authors 
      and only randomized controlled trials will be included. The risk of bias will be 
      assessed independently by two authors following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic 
      Reviews of Interventions. We will use RevMan software and random-effects models to 
      assess the heterogeneity and data synthesis.If any plan for documenting important 
      protocol amendments changes, the researchers will make a revision agreement and then 
      register the modification on PROSPERO. CONCLUSION: Through this systematic review, a 
      comprehensive understanding of current non-pharmacological interventions on dementia 
      will be available. Meanwhile, it will provide basic evidence for further clinical 
      research. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required because no 
      individual patient's data are included in this paper. This study will be 
      disseminated through conference presentation. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis guidelines recommend long-term macrolide treatment for 
      patients with three or more exacerbations per year without Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      infection. Randomised controlled trials suggest that long-term macrolide treatment 
      can prevent exacerbations in adult patients with bronchiectasis, but these 
      individual studies have been too small to do meaningful subgroup analyses. We did a 
      systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to explore 
      macrolide benefit in subpopulations, including those in which macrolide therapy is 
      not currently recommended. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from Jan 1, 2000, to Sept 
      30, 2018, to identify double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of 
      macrolide antibiotics in adult patients with bronchiectasis. We applied no language 
      restrictions. Randomised controlled trials were eligible if treatment was defined a 
      priori as long term and had a primary or secondary outcome of bronchiectasis 
      exacerbations. Studies in patients with cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were 
      excluded. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was frequency of exacerbations 
      requiring treatment with antibiotics. Secondary endpoints were time to first 
      exacerbation, change in quality of life according to the St George's Respiratory 
      Questionnaire (SGRQ), and change in FEV(1). IPD meta-analysis was done using fixed 
      effects models adjusting for age, sex, FEV(1), and trial. We did prespecified 
      subgroup analyses for each of the primary and secondary endpoints using one-step 
      meta-analysis only. Subgroups were defined by age, sex, previous exacerbation 
      frequency, smoking status, inhaled corticosteroid use at baseline, body-mass index 
      at baseline, cause, C-reactive protein at baseline, baseline FEV(1) percentage of 
      predicted, SGRQ total score, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum culture at 
      baseline. The meta-analysis is registered with the PROSPERO international register 
      of systematic reviews, number CRD42018102908. FINDINGS: Of 234 identified studies, 
      we included three randomised controlled trials, and IPD was obtained for 341 
      participants. Macrolide antibiotics reduced the frequency of exacerbations (adjusted 
      incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·49, 95% CI 0·36 to 0·66; p<0·0001). We also found that 
      macrolide treatment improved the time to first exacerbation (adjusted hazard ratio 
      0·46, 0·34 to 0·61; p<0·0001) and was associated with improved quality of life 
      measured by the SGRQ (mean improvement 2·93 points, 0·03 to 5·83; p=0·048). 
      Macrolides were not associated with a significant improvement in FEV(1) (67 mL at 1 
      year, -22 to 112; p=0·14). Effect estimates in prespecified subgroup analyses 
      revealed a reduced frequency of exacerbations in all prespecified subgroups, 
      including a high level of benefit in patients with P aeruginosa infection (IRR 0·36, 
      0·18-0·72; p=0·0044) and in patients with one to two exacerbations per year (0·37, 
      0·16-0·88; p=0·025). Studies were rated as low risk of bias across all domains. 
      INTERPRETATION: Long-term macrolide treatment significantly reduces the frequency of 
      exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis, with similar benefits observed in all 
      subgroups based on patient characteristics. This finding suggests that macrolides 
      might be considered in patients in whom macrolides are not indicated according to 
      the current guidelines, particularly if alternative approaches to reduce 
      exacerbations have been unsuccessful. However, downsides of long-term macrolide 
      treatment must also be taken into account. FUNDING: European Respiratory Society.

TI  - Induction Chemotherapy plus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Endemic Nasopharyngeal 
      Carcinoma: Individual Patient Data Pooled Analysis of Four Randomized Trials.
PG  - 1824-1833
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-2656 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Because of the uneven geographic distribution and small number of 
      randomized trials available, the value of additional induction chemotherapy (IC) to 
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains 
      controversial. This study performed an individual patient data (IPD) pooled analysis 
      to better assess the precise role of IC + CCRT in locoregionally advanced 
      NPC.Experimental Design: Four randomized trials in endemic areas were identified, 
      representing 1,193 patients; updated IPD were obtained. Progression-free survival 
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were the primary and secondary endpoints, 
      respectively.Results: Median follow-up was 5.0 years. The HR for PFS was 0.70 [95% 
      confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.86; P = 0.0009; 9.3% absolute benefit at 5 years] 
      in favor of IC + CCRT versus CCRT alone. IC + CCRT also improved OS (HR = 0.75; 95% 
      CI, 0.57-0.99; P = 0.04) and reduced distant failure (HR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90; 
      P = 0.008). IC + CCRT had a tendency to improve locoregional control compared with 
      CCRT alone (HR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.48-1.01; P = 0.06). There was no heterogeneity 
      between trials in any analysis. No interactions between patient characteristics and 
      treatment effects on PFS or OS were found. After adding two supplementary trials to 
      provide a more comprehensive overview, the conclusions remained valid and were 
      strengthened. In a supplementary Bayesian network analysis, no statistically 
      significant differences in survival between different IC regimens were 
      detected.Conclusions: This IPD pooled analysis demonstrates the superiority of 
      additional IC over CCRT alone in locoregionally advanced NPC, with the survival 
      benefit mainly associated with improved distant control. Clin Cancer Res; 24(8);

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous systematic reviews have indicated that exercise-based cardiac 
      rehabilitation (ExCR) for patients with heart failure (HF) has a beneficial effect 
      on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and exercise capacity. However, there is 
      uncertainty regarding potential differential effects of ExCR across HF patient 
      subgroups. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to undertake an individual participant 
      data (IPD) meta-analysis to: 1) assess the impact of ExCR on HRQoL and exercise 
      capacity in patients with HF; and 2) investigate differential effects of ExCR 
      according to a range of patient characteristics: age, sex, ethnicity, New York Heart 
      Association functional class, ischemic etiology, ejection fraction, and exercise 
      capacity. METHODS: A single dataset was produced, comprising randomized trials where 
      ExCR (delivered for 3 weeks or more) was compared with a no exercise control group. 
      Each trial provided IPD on HRQoL or exercise capacity (or both), with follow-up of 
      6 months or more. One- and 2-stage meta-analysis models were used to investigate the 
      effect of ExCR overall and the interactions between ExCR and participant 
      characteristics. RESULTS: IPD was obtained from 13 trials for 3,990 patients, 
      predominantly (97%) with reduced ejection fraction HF. Compared with the control 
      group, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of ExCR for HRQoL 
      and exercise capacity. At 12-month follow-up, improvements were seen in 6-min walk 
      test (mean 21.0 m; 95% confidence interval: 1.57 to 40.4 m; p = 0.034) and Minnesota 
      Living With HF score (mean improvement 5.9; 95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 10.9; 
      p = 0.018). No consistent evidence was found of differential intervention effects 
      across patient subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: These results, based on an IPD meta-analysis 
      of randomized trials, confirm the benefit of ExCR on HRQoL and exercise capacity and 
      support the Class I recommendation of current international clinical guidelines that 
      ExCR should be offered to all HF patients. (Exercise Training for Chronic Heart 
      Failure [ExTraMATCH II]: protocol for an individual participant data meta-analysis;

TI  - Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction: An Individual 
      Patient Meta-Analysis: Thrombectomy Trialists Collaboration.
PG  - 143-152
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.025371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for 
      the treatment of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been widely 
      used; however, recent trials have questioned its value and safety. In this 
      meta-analysis, we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool the individual patient 
      data from these trials to determine the benefits and risks of thrombus aspiration 
      during PCI in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. METHODS: 
      Included were large (n≥1000), randomized, controlled trials comparing manual 
      thrombectomy and PCI alone in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial 
      infarction. Individual patient data were provided by the leadership of each trial. 
      The prespecified primary efficacy outcome was cardiovascular mortality within 30 
      days, and the primary safety outcome was stroke or transient ischemic attack within 
      30 days. RESULTS: The 3 eligible randomized trials (TAPAS [Thrombus Aspiration 
      During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction], TASTE 
      [Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia], and 
      TOTAL [Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy With PCI Versus PCI Alone in 
      Patients With STEMI]) enrolled 19 047 patients, of whom 18 306 underwent PCI and 
      were included in the primary analysis. Cardiovascular death at 30 days occurred in 
      221 of 9155 patients (2.4%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 262 of 9151 (2.9%) 
      randomized to PCI alone (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-1.01; 
      P=0.06). Stroke or transient ischemic attack occurred in 66 (0.8%) randomized to 
      thrombus aspiration and 46 (0.5%) randomized to PCI alone (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% 
      confidence interval, 0.98-2.10; P=0.06). There were no significant differences in 
      recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, heart failure, or target vessel 
      revascularization. In the subgroup with high thrombus burden (TIMI [Thrombolysis in 
      Myocardial Infarction] thrombus grade ≥3), thrombus aspiration was associated with 
      fewer cardiovascular deaths (170 [2.5%] versus 205 [3.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% 
      confidence interval, 0.65-0.98; P=0.03) and with more strokes or transient ischemic 
      attacks (55 [0.9%] versus 34 [0.5%]; odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 
      1.02-2.42, P=0.04). However, the interaction P values were 0.32 and 0.34, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Routine thrombus aspiration during PCI for 
      ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction did not improve clinical outcomes. In the 
      high thrombus burden group, the trends toward reduced cardiovascular death and 
      increased stroke or transient ischemic attack provide a rationale for future trials 
      of improved thrombus aspiration technologies in this high-risk subgroup. CLINICAL

AB  - CONTEXT: The European Association of Urology non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
      (NMIBC) guidelines recommend that all low- and intermediate-risk patients receive a 
      single immediate instillation of chemotherapy after transurethral resection of the 
      bladder (TURB), but its use remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To identify which 
      NMIBC patients benefit from a single immediate instillation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A 
      systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomized 
      trials comparing the efficacy of a single instillation after TURB with TURB alone in 
      NMIBC patients was carried out. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 13 eligible studies 
      were identified. IPD were obtained for 11 studies randomizing 2278 eligible 
      patients, 1161 to TURB and 1117 to a single instillation of epirubicin, mitomycin C, 
      pirarubicin, or thiotepa. A total of 1128 recurrences, 108 progressions, and 460 
      deaths (59 due to bladder cancer [BCa]) occurred. A single instillation reduced the 
      risk of recurrence by 35% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      0.58-0.74; p<0.001) and the 5-yr recurrence rate from 58.8% to 44.8%. The 
      instillation did not reduce recurrences in patients with a prior recurrence rate of 
      more than one recurrence per year or in patients with an European Organization for 
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recurrence score ≥5. The instillation did 
      not prolong either the time to progression or death from BCa, but it resulted in an 
      increase in the overall risk of death (HR: 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.51; p=0.015; 5-yr 
      death rates 12.0% vs 11.2%), with the difference appearing in patients with an EORTC 
      recurrence score ≥5. CONCLUSIONS: A single immediate instillation reduced the risk 
      of recurrence, except in patients with a prior recurrence rate of more than one 
      recurrence per year or an EORTC recurrence score ≥5. It does not prolong either time 
      to progression or death from BCa. The instillation may be associated with an 
      increase in the risk of death in patients at high risk of recurrence in whom the 
      instillation is not effective or recommended. PATIENT SUMMARY: A single instillation 
      of chemotherapy immediately after resection reduces the risk of recurrence in 
      non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer; however, it should not be given to patients at 
      high risk of recurrence due to its lack of efficacy in this subgroup.

TI  - Continuous versus Intermittent β-Lactam Infusion in Severe Sepsis. A Meta-analysis 
      of Individual Patient Data from Randomized Trials.
PG  - 681-91
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201601-0024OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Optimization of β-lactam antibiotic dosing for critically ill patients is 
      an intervention that may improve outcomes in severe sepsis. OBJECTIVES: In this 
      individual patient data meta-analysis of critically ill patients with severe sepsis, 
      we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of those treated with continuous versus 
      intermittent infusion of β-lactam antibiotics. METHODS: We identified relevant 
      randomized controlled trials comparing continuous versus intermittent infusion of 
      β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients with severe sepsis. We assessed the 
      quality of the studies according to four criteria. We combined individual patient 
      data from studies and assessed data integrity for common baseline demographics and 
      study endpoints, including hospital mortality censored at 30 days and clinical cure. 
      We then determined the pooled estimates of effect and investigated factors 
      associated with hospital mortality in multivariable analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: We identified three randomized controlled trials in which researchers 
      recruited a total of 632 patients with severe sepsis. The two groups were well 
      balanced in terms of age, sex, and illness severity. The rates of hospital mortality 
      and clinical cure for the continuous versus intermittent infusion groups were 19.6% 
      versus 26.3% (relative risk, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-1.00; P = 0.045) 
      and 55.4% versus 46.3% (relative risk, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.40; 
      P = 0.021), respectively. In a multivariable model, intermittent β-lactam 
      administration, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, use 
      of renal replacement therapy, and infection by nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli 
      were significantly associated with hospital mortality. Continuous β-lactam 
      administration was not independently associated with clinical cure. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Compared with intermittent dosing, administration of β-lactam antibiotics by 
      continuous infusion in critically ill patients with severe sepsis is associated with 
      decreased hospital mortality.

TI  - Placebo Effects on the Neurologic Pain Signature: A Meta-analysis of Individual 
      Participant Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data.
PG  - 1321-1330
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.2017 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Placebo effects reduce pain and contribute to clinical analgesia, but 
      after decades of research, it remains unclear whether placebo treatments mainly 
      affect nociceptive processes or other processes associated with pain evaluation. 
      OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic, participant-level meta-analysis to test the 
      effect of placebo treatments on pain-associated functional neuroimaging responses in 
      the neurologic pain signature (NPS), a multivariate brain pattern tracking 
      nociceptive pain. DATA SOURCES: Medline (PubMed) was searched from inception to May 
      2015; the search was augmented with results from previous meta-analyses and expert 
      recommendations. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were original investigations that 
      were published in English in peer-reviewed journals and that involved functional 
      neuroimaging of the human brain with evoked pain delivered under stimulus 
      intensity-matched placebo and control conditions. The authors of all eligible 
      studies were contacted and asked to provide single-participant data. DATA EXTRACTION 
      AND SYNTHESIS: Data were collected between December 2015 and November 2017 following 
      the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of individual 
      participant data guidelines. Results were summarized across participants and studies 
      in a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main, a priori outcome 
      was NPS response; pain reports were assessed as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: We 
      obtained data from 20 of 28 identified eligible studies, resulting in a total sample 
      size of 603 healthy individuals. The NPS responses to painful stimulation compared 
      with baseline conditions were positive in 575 participants (95.4%), with a very 
      large effect size (g = 2.30 [95% CI, 1.92 to 2.69]), confirming its sensitivity to 
      nociceptive pain in this sample. Placebo treatments showed significant behavioral 
      outcomes on pain ratings in 17 of 20 studies (85%) and in the combined sample 
      (g = -0.66 [95% CI, -0.80 to -0.53]). However, placebo effects on the NPS response 
      were significant in only 3 of 20 studies (15%) and were very small in the combined 
      sample (g = -0.08 [95% CI, -0.15 to -0.01]). Similarly, analyses restricted to 
      studies with low risk of bias (g = -0.07 [95% CI, -0.15 to 0.00]) indicated very 
      small effects, and analyses of just placebo responders (g = -0.22 [95% CI, -0.34 to 
      -0.11]) indicated small effects, as well. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Placebo 
      treatments have moderate analgesic effects on pain reports. The very small effects 
      on NPS, a validated measure that tracks levels of nociceptive pain, indicate that 
      placebo treatments affect pain via brain mechanisms largely independent of effects 
      on bottom-up nociceptive processing.

      colds were on average 40% shorter for the zinc groups. However, the duration of 
      colds is a time outcome, and survival analysis may be a more informative approach. 
      The objective of this individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was to estimate 
      the effect of zinc acetate lozenges on the rate of recovery from colds. METHODS: We 
      analyzed IPD for 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials in which 80-92 mg/day of 
      elemental zinc were administered as zinc acetate lozenges to 199 common cold 
      patients. We used mixed-effects Cox regression to estimate the effect of zinc. 
      RESULTS: Patients administered zinc lozenges recovered faster by rate ratio 3.1 (95% 
      confidence interval, 2.1-4.7). The effect was not modified by age, sex, race, 
      allergy, smoking, or baseline common cold severity. On the 5th day, 70% of the zinc 
      patients had recovered compared with 27% of the placebo patients. Accordingly, 2.6 
      times more patients were cured in the zinc group. The difference also corresponds to 
      the number needed to treat of 2.3 on the 5th day. None of the studies observed 
      serious adverse effects of zinc. CONCLUSIONS: The 3-fold increase in the rate of 
      recovery from the common cold is a clinically important effect. The optimal 
      formulation of zinc lozenges and an ideal frequency of their administration should 
      be examined. Given the evidence of efficacy, common cold patients may be instructed 
      to try zinc acetate lozenges within 24 hours of onset of symptoms.

TI  - Effects of Whole-Body Electromyostimulation on Low Back Pain in People with Chronic 
      Unspecific Dorsal Pain: A Meta-Analysis of Individual Patient Data from Randomized 
      Controlled WB-EMS Trials.

AB  - In order to evaluate the favorable effect of whole-body electromyostimulation 
      (WB-EMS) on low back pain (LBP), an aspect which is frequently claimed by commercial 
      providers, we performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data. The analysis is 
      based on five of our recently conducted randomized controlled WB-EMS trials with 
      adults 60 years+, all of which applied similar WB-EMS protocols (1.5 sessions/week, 
      bipolar current, 16-25 min/session, 85 Hz, 350 μs, and 4-6 s impulse/4 s 
      impulse-break) and used the same pain questionnaire. From these underlying trials, 
      we included only subjects with frequent-chronic LBP in the present meta-analysis. 
      Study endpoints were pain intensity and frequency at the lumbar spine. In summary, 
      23 participants of the underlying WB-EMS and 22 subjects of the control groups (CG) 
      were pooled in a joint WB-EMS and CG. At baseline, no group differences with respect 
      to LBP intensity and frequency were observed. Pain intensity improved significantly 
      in the WB-EMS (p < .001) and was maintained (p = .997) in the CG. LBP frequency 
      decreased significantly in the WB-EMS (p < .001) and improved nonsignificantly in 
      the CG (p = .057). Group differences for both LBP parameters were significant (p ≤ 
      .035). We concluded that WB-EMS appears to be an effective training tool for 
      reducing LBP; however, RCTs should further address this issue with more specified 
      study protocols.

TI  - Vitamin D status and risk of incident tuberculosis disease: A nested case-control

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the association between preexisting vitamin D 
      deficiency and incident tuberculosis (TB). We assessed the impact of baseline 
      vitamins D levels on TB disease risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We assessed the 
      association between baseline vitamin D and incident TB in a prospective cohort of 
      6,751 HIV-negative household contacts of TB patients enrolled between September 1, 
      2009, and August 29, 2012, in Lima, Peru. We screened for TB disease at 2, 6, and 12 
      months after enrollment. We defined cases as household contacts who developed TB 
      disease at least 15 days after enrollment of the index patient. For each case, we 
      randomly selected four controls from among contacts who did not develop TB disease, 
      matching on gender and year of age. We also conducted a one-stage 
      individual-participant data (IPD) meta-analysis searching PubMed and Embase to 
      identify prospective studies of vitamin D and TB disease until June 8, 2019. We 
      included studies that assessed vitamin D before TB diagnosis. In the primary 
      analysis, we defined vitamin D deficiency as 25-(OH)D < 50 nmol/L, insufficiency as 
      50-75 nmol/L, and sufficiency as >75nmol/L. We estimated the association between 
      baseline vitamin D status and incident TB using conditional logistic regression in 
      the Lima cohort and generalized linear mixed models in the meta-analysis. We further 
      defined severe vitamin D deficiency as 25-(OH)D < 25 nmol/L and performed stratified 
      analyses by HIV status in the IPD meta-analysis. In the Lima cohort, we analyzed 180 
      cases and 709 matched controls. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for TB risk among 
      participants with baseline vitamin D deficiency compared to sufficient vitamin D was 
      1.63 (95% CI 0.75-3.52; p = 0.22). We included seven published studies in the 
      meta-analysis and analyzed 3,544 participants. In the pooled analysis, the aOR was 
      1.48 (95% CI 1.04-2.10; p = 0.03). The aOR for severe vitamin D deficiency was 2.05 
      (95% CI 0.87-4.87; p trend for decreasing 25-(OH)D levels from sufficient vitamin D 
      to severe deficiency = 0.02). Among 1,576 HIV-positive patients, vitamin D 
      deficiency conferred a 2-fold (aOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.22-3.90; p = 0.01) increased risk 
      of TB, and the aOR for severe vitamin D deficiency compared to sufficient vitamin D 
      was 4.28 (95% CI 0.85-21.45; p = 0.08). Our Lima cohort study is limited by the 
      short duration of follow-up, and the IPD meta-analysis is limited by the number of 
      possible confounding covariates available across all studies. CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings suggest vitamin D predicts TB disease risk in a dose-dependent manner and 
      that the risk of TB disease is highest among HIV-positive individuals with severe 
      vitamin D deficiency. Randomized control trials are needed to evaluate the possible 
      role of vitamin D supplementation on reducing TB disease risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Four studies previously indicated that the effect of malaria infection 
      during pregnancy on the risk of low birthweight (LBW; <2,500 g) may depend upon 
      maternal nutritional status. We investigated this dependence further using a large, 
      diverse study population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated the interaction between 
      maternal malaria infection and maternal anthropometric status on the risk of LBW 
      using pooled data from 14,633 pregnancies from 13 studies (6 cohort studies and 7 
      randomized controlled trials) conducted in Africa and the Western Pacific from 
      1996-2015. Studies were identified by the Maternal Malaria and Malnutrition (M3) 
      initiative using a convenience sampling approach and were eligible for pooling given 
      adequate ethical approval and availability of essential variables. Study-specific 
      adjusted effect estimates were calculated using inverse probability of 
      treatment-weighted linear and log-binomial regression models and pooled using a 
      random-effects model. The adjusted risk of delivering a baby with LBW was 8.8% among 
      women with malaria infection at antenatal enrollment compared to 7.7% among 
      uninfected women (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 
      0.91, 1.42]; N = 13,613), 10.5% among women with malaria infection at delivery 
      compared to 7.9% among uninfected women (aRR 1.32 [95% CI: 1.08, 1.62]; N = 11,826), 
      and 15.3% among women with low mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC <23 cm) at 
      enrollment compared to 9.5% among women with MUAC ≥ 23 cm (aRR 1.60 [95% CI: 1.36, 
      1.87]; N = 9,008). The risk of delivering a baby with LBW was 17.8% among women with 
      both malaria infection and low MUAC at enrollment compared to 8.4% among uninfected 
      women with MUAC ≥ 23 cm (joint aRR 2.13 [95% CI: 1.21, 3.73]; N = 8,152). There was 
      no evidence of synergism (i.e., excess risk due to interaction) between malaria 
      infection and MUAC on the multiplicative (p = 0.5) or additive scale (p = 0.9). 
      Results were similar using body mass index (BMI) as an anthropometric indicator of 
      nutritional status. Meta-regression results indicated that there may be 
      multiplicative interaction between malaria infection at enrollment and low MUAC 
      within studies conducted in Africa; however, this finding was not consistent on the 
      additive scale, when accounting for multiple comparisons, or when using other 
      definitions of malaria and malnutrition. The major limitations of the study included 
      availability of only 2 cross-sectional measurements of malaria and the limited 
      availability of ultrasound-based pregnancy dating to assess impacts on preterm birth 
      and fetal growth in all studies. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with malnutrition and 
      malaria infection are at increased risk of LBW compared to women with only 1 risk 
      factor or none, but malaria and malnutrition do not act synergistically.

TI  - Efficacy of Self-guided Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in the Treatment 
      of Depressive Symptoms: A Meta-analysis of Individual Participant Data.
PG  - 351-359
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.0044 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Self-guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has the 
      potential to increase access and availability of evidence-based therapy and reduce 
      the cost of depression treatment. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effect of self-guided 
      iCBT in treating adults with depressive symptoms compared with controls and evaluate 
      the moderating effects of treatment outcome and response. DATA SOURCES: A total of 
      13 384 abstracts were retrieved through a systematic literature search in PubMed, 
      Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library from database inception to January 1, 2016. 
      STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials in which self-guided iCBT was compared 
      with a control (usual care, waiting list, or attention control) in individuals with 
      symptoms of depression. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Primary authors provided 
      individual participant data from 3876 participants from 13 of 16 eligible studies. 
      Missing data were handled using multiple imputations. Mixed-effects models with 
      participants nested within studies were used to examine treatment outcomes and 
      moderators. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included the Beck Depression 
      Inventory, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, and 9-item Patient 
      Health Questionnaire scores. Scales were standardized across the pool of the 
      included studies. RESULTS: Of the 3876 study participants, the mean (SD) age was 
      42.0 (11.7) years, 2531 (66.0%) of 3832 were female, 1368 (53.1%) of 2574 completed 
      secondary education, and 2262 (71.9%) of 3146 were employed. Self-guided iCBT was 
      significantly more effective than controls on depressive symptoms severity 
      (β = -0.21; Hedges g  = 0.27) and treatment response (β = 0.53; odds ratio, 1.95; 
      95% CI, 1.52-2.50; number needed to treat, 8). Adherence to treatment was associated 
      with lower depressive symptoms (β = -0.19; P = .001) and greater response to 
      treatment (β = 0.90; P < .001). None of the examined participant and study-level 
      variables moderated treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Self-guided iCBT 
      is effective in treating depressive symptoms. The use of meta-analyses of individual 
      participant data provides substantial evidence for clinical and policy decision 
      making because self-guided iCBT can be considered as an evidence-based first-step 
      approach in treating symptoms of depression. Several limitations of the iCBT should 
      be addressed before it can be disseminated into routine care.

TI  - Survival Advantage of Laparoscopic Versus Open Resection For Colorectal Liver 
      Metastases: A Meta-analysis of Individual Patient Data From Randomized Trials and 
      Propensity-score Matched Studies.
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000003672 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform an individual participant data meta-analysis using randomized 
      trials and propensity-score matched (PSM) studies which compared laparoscopic versus 
      open hepatectomy for patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). BACKGROUND: 
      Randomized trials and PSM studies constitute the highest level of evidence in 
      addressing the long-term oncologic efficacy of laparoscopic versus open resection 
      for CLM. However, individual studies are limited by the reporting of overall 
      survival in ways not amenable to traditional methods of meta-analysis, and violation 
      of the proportional hazards assumption. METHODS: Survival information of individual 
      patients was reconstructed from the published Kaplan-Meier curves with the aid of a 
      computer vision program. Frequentist and Bayesian survival models (taking into 
      account random-effects and nonproportional hazards) were fitted to compare overall 
      survival of patients who underwent laparoscopic versus open surgery. To handle long 
      plateaus in the tails of survival curves, we also exploited "cure models" to 
      estimate the fraction of patients effectively "cured" of disease. RESULTS: 
      Individual patient data from 2 randomized trials and 13 PSM studies involving 3148 
      participants were reconstructed. Laparoscopic resection was associated with a lower 
      hazard rate of death (stratified hazard ratio = 0.853, 95% confidence interval: 
      0.754-0.965, P = 0.0114), and there was evidence of time-varying effects (P = 
      0.0324) in which the magnitude of hazard ratios increased over time. The fractions 
      of long-term cancer survivors were estimated to be 47.4% and 18.0% in the 
      laparoscopy and open surgery groups, respectively. At 10-year follow-up, the 
      restricted mean survival time was 8.6 months (or 12.1%) longer in the laparoscopy 
      arm (P < 0.0001). In a subgroup analysis, elderly patients (≥65 years old) treated 
      with laparoscopy experienced longer 3-year average life expectancy (+6.2%, P = 
      0.018), and those who live past the 5-year milestone (46.1%) seem to be cured of 
      disease. CONCLUSIONS: This patient-level meta-analysis of high-quality studies 
      demonstrated an unexpected survival benefit in favor of laparoscopic over open 
      resection for CLM in the long-term. From a conservative viewpoint, these results can 
      be interpreted to indicate that laparoscopy is at least not inferior to the standard 
      open approach.

TI  - Safety and Efficacy of Solitaire Stent Thrombectomy: Individual Patient Data 
      Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent positive randomized trials of endovascular therapy 
      for ischemic stroke used predominantly stent retrievers. We pooled data to 
      investigate the efficacy and safety of stent thrombectomy using the Solitaire device 
      in anterior circulation ischemic stroke. METHODS: Patient-level data were pooled 
      from trials in which the Solitaire was the only or the predominant device used in a 
      prespecified meta-analysis (SEER Collaboration): Solitaire FR With the Intention for 
      Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment (SWIFT PRIME), Endovascular Treatment 
      for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on 
      Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE), Extending the Time for Thrombolysis 
      in Emergency Neurological Deficits-Intra-Arterial (EXTEND-IA), and Randomized Trial 
      of Revascularization With Solitaire FR Device Versus Best Medical Therapy in the 
      Treatment of Acute Stroke Due to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion 
      Presenting Within Eight Hours of Symptom Onset (REVASCAT). The primary outcome was 
      ordinal analysis of modified Rankin Score at 90 days. The primary analysis included 
      all patients in the 4 trials with 2 sensitivity analyses: (1) excluding patients in 
      whom Solitaire was not the first device used and (2) including the 3 Solitaire-only 
      trials (excluding ESCAPE). Secondary outcomes included functional independence 
      (modified Rankin Score 0-2), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and mortality. 
      RESULTS: The primary analysis included 787 patients: 401 randomized to endovascular 
      thrombectomy and 386 to standard care, and 82.6% received intravenous thrombolysis. 
      The common odds ratio for modified Rankin Score improvement was 2.7 (2.0-3.5) with 
      no heterogeneity in effect by age, sex, baseline stroke severity, extent of computed 
      tomography changes, site of occlusion, or pretreatment with alteplase. The number 
      needed to treat to reduce disability was 2.5 and for an extra patient to achieve 
      independent outcome was 4.25 (3.29-5.99). Successful revascularization occurred in 
      77% treated with Solitaire device. The rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage 
      and overall mortality did not differ between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Solitaire thrombectomy for large vessel ischemic stroke was safe and highly 
      effective with substantially reduced disability. Benefits were consistent in all 
      prespecified subgroups.

TI  - Immediate Delivery Compared With Expectant Management in Late Preterm Prelabor 
      Rupture of Membranes: An Individual Participant Data Meta-analysis.
PG  - 269-279
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000002447 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of immediate delivery an expectant management 
      among women whose pregnancies were complicated by preterm prelabor rupture of 
      membranes (PROM) in the late preterm period (from 34 0/7 weeks until 36 6/7 weeks of 
      gestation). DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, EMBASE, and the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception until 
      December 2016. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We included all randomized controlled 
      trials with individual participant data reporting on late preterm PROM with 
      randomization to immediate delivery or expectant management. The primary outcome was 
      a composite of adverse neonatal outcomes: probable or definitive neonatal sepsis, 
      necrotizing enterocolitis, respiratory distress syndrome, stillbirth, or neonatal 
      death. TABULATION, INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Of eight eligible trials (total n=3,203 
      mothers), three (2,563 mothers, 2,572 neonates) had individual participant data 
      available. The composite adverse neonatal outcome occurred in 9.6% of neonates in 
      the immediate delivery group and 8.3% in the expectant management group (relative 
      risk [RR] 1.20, 95% CI 0.94-1.55). Neonatal sepsis rates were 2.6% and 3.5%, 
      respectively (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.47-1.15). Neonates in the immediate delivery group 
      were more likely to be diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome (RR 1.47, 95% CI 
      1.10-1.97), and to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit or special care 
      nursery (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.23) and had longer admissions. Mothers randomized to 
      immediate delivery were less likely to have an antepartum hemorrhage (RR 0.57, 95% 
      CI 0.34-0.95) or chorioamnionitis (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.13-0.35), but more likely to 
      undergo cesarean delivery (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.47). CONCLUSION: In women with 
      late preterm PROM, immediate delivery and expectant management resulted in 
      comparable rates of the composite of adverse neonatal outcomes. Effects on 
      individual secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes were mixed. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

TI  - First-line selective internal radiotherapy plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
      alone in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer (FOXFIRE, SIRFLOX, 
      and FOXFIRE-Global): a combined analysis of three multicentre, randomised, phase 3 
      trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data suggest selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) in third-line or 
      subsequent therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer has clinical benefit in patients 
      with colorectal liver metastases with liver-dominant disease after chemotherapy. The 
      FOXFIRE, SIRFLOX, and FOXFIRE-Global randomised studies evaluated the efficacy of 
      combining first-line chemotherapy with SIRT using yttrium-90 resin microspheres in 
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with liver metastases. The studies were 
      designed for combined analysis of overall survival. METHODS: FOXFIRE, SIRFLOX, and 
      FOXFIRE-Global were randomised, phase 3 trials done in hospitals and specialist 
      liver centres in 14 countries worldwide (Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, 
      Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, South Korea, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, 
      and the USA). Chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (WHO 
      performance status 0 or 1) with liver metastases not suitable for curative resection 
      or ablation were randomly assigned (1:1) to either oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy 
      (FOLFOX: leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) or FOLFOX plus single treatment 
      SIRT concurrent with cycle 1 or 2 of chemotherapy. In FOXFIRE, FOLFOX chemotherapy 
      was OxMdG (oxaliplatin modified de Gramont chemotherapy; 85 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin 
      infusion over 2 h, L-leucovorin 175 mg or D,L-leucovorin 350 mg infusion over 2 h, 
      and 400 mg/m(2) bolus fluorouracil followed by a 2400 mg/m(2) continuous 
      fluorouracil infusion over 46 h). In SIRFLOX and FOXFIRE-Global, FOLFOX chemotherapy 
      was modified FOLFOX6 (85 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin infusion over 2 h, 200 mg leucovorin, 
      and 400 mg/m(2) bolus fluorouracil followed by a 2400 mg/m(2) continuous 
      fluorouracil infusion over 46 h). Randomisation was done by central minimisation 
      with four factors: presence of extrahepatic metastases, tumour involvement of the 
      liver, planned use of a biological agent, and investigational centre. Participants 
      and investigators were not masked to treatment. The primary endpoint was overall 
      survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population, using a two-stage 
      meta-analysis of pooled individual patient data. All three trials have completed 2 
      years of follow-up. FOXFIRE is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number 
      ISRCTN83867919. SIRFLOX and FOXFIRE-Global are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      numbers NCT00724503 (SIRFLOX) and NCT01721954 (FOXFIRE-Global). FINDINGS: Between 
      Oct 11, 2006, and Dec 23, 2014, 549 patients were randomly assigned to FOLFOX alone 
      and 554 patients were assigned FOLFOX plus SIRT. Median follow-up was 43·3 months 
      (IQR 31·6-58·4). There were 411 (75%) deaths in 549 patients in the FOLFOX alone 
      group and 433 (78%) deaths in 554 patients in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group. There was 
      no difference in overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1·04, 95% CI 0·90-1·19; 
      p=0·61). The median survival time in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group was 22·6 months (95% 
      CI 21·0-24·5) compared with 23·3 months (21·8-24·7) in the FOLFOX alone group. In 
      the safety population containing patients who received at least one dose of study 
      treatment, as treated, the most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia (137 
      [24%] of 571 patients receiving FOLFOX alone vs 186 (37%) of 507 patients receiving 
      FOLFOX plus SIRT). Serious adverse events of any grade occurred in 244 (43%) of 571 
      patients receiving FOLFOX alone and 274 (54%) of 507 patients receiving FOLFOX plus 
      SIRT. 10 patients in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group and 11 patients in the FOLFOX alone 
      group died due to an adverse event; eight treatment-related deaths occurred in the 
      FOLFOX plus SIRT group and three treatment-related deaths occurred in the FOLFOX 
      alone group. INTERPRETATION: Addition of SIRT to first-line FOLFOX chemotherapy for 
      patients with liver-only and liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer did not 
      improve overall survival compared with that for FOLFOX alone. Therefore, early use 
      of SIRT in combination with chemotherapy in unselected patients with metastatic 
      colorectal cancer cannot be recommended. To further define the role of SIRT in 
      metastatic colorectal cancer, careful patient selection and studies investigating 
      the role of SIRT as consolidation therapy after chemotherapy are needed. FUNDING:

TI  - Thread-embedding acupuncture for lumbar herniated intervertebral disc: Protocol for 
      a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e17847
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000017847 [doi]
LID - e17847
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lumbar herniated intervertebral disc (LHIVD) is a frequent disease among 
      patients attending Korean medicine hospitals, and it is associated with considerable 
      medical expenses for the patients. Although several recent randomized clinical 
      trials (RCTs) have reported that thread-embedding acupuncture (TEA) has a more 
      favorable therapeutic effect on LHIVD than other types of acupuncture or other 
      treatments, the evidence remains limited because these trials used poor assessment 
      methods and had a high risk of bias. This study aims to evaluate the evidence for 
      the effectiveness and safety of TEA for LHIVD. In this article, we describe our 
      methods and plan for a systematic review. METHODS: We will conduct an electronic 
      search of the following databases from their inception to May 2018: MEDLINE; EMBASE; 
      COCHRANE; China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (a Chinese database); CiNii 
      and J-STAGE (Japanese databases); and KoreaMed, Korean Medical Database (KMbase), 
      Korean Studies Information Service System (KISS), National Digital Science Library 
      (NDSL), Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI), Oriental 
      Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS). RCTs investigating any type 
      of TEA will be included. The risk of bias in each study will be evaluated using the 
      Cochrane risk of bias tool. Risk ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence 
      intervals will be used to show the effects of TEA if it will be possible to conduct 
      a meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses will also be conducted in this study. ETHICS 
      AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not necessary as this paper does not involve 
      patient data. The review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal or presented 
      in a conference. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42019133060.

TI  - Metastasis-Free Survival Is a Strong Surrogate of Overall Survival in Localized 
      Prostate Cancer.
PG  - 3097-3104
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2017.73.9987 [doi]
AB  - Purpose Adjuvant therapy for intermediate-risk and high-risk localized prostate 
      cancer decreases the number of deaths from this disease. Surrogates for overall 
      survival (OS) could expedite the evaluation of new adjuvant therapies. Methods By 
      June 2013, 102 completed or ongoing randomized trials were identified and individual 
      patient data were collected from 28 trials with 28,905 patients. Disease-free 
      survival (DFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) were determined for 21,140 
      patients from 24 trials and 12,712 patients from 19 trials, respectively. We 
      evaluated the surrogacy of DFS and MFS for OS by using a two-stage meta-analytic 
      validation model by determining the correlation of an intermediate clinical end 
      point with OS and the correlation of treatment effects on both the intermediate 
      clinical end point and OS. Results Trials enrolled patients from 1987 to 2011. After 
      a median follow-up of 10 years, 45% of 21,140 men and 45% of 12,712 men experienced 
      a DFS and MFS event, respectively. For DFS and MFS, 61% and 90% of the patients, 
      respectively, were from radiation trials, and 63% and 66%, respectively, had 
      high-risk disease. At the patient level, Kendall's τ correlation with OS was 0.85 
      and 0.91 for DFS and MFS, respectively. At the trial level, R(2) was 0.86 (95% CI, 
      0.78 to 0.90) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.88) from weighted linear regression of 
      8-year OS rates versus 5-year DFS and MFS rates, respectively. Treatment 
      effects-measured by log hazard ratios-for the surrogates and OS were well correlated 
      ( R(2), 0.73 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.82] for DFS and 0.92 [95% CI, 0.81 to 0.95] for 
      MFS). Conclusion MFS is a strong surrogate for OS for localized prostate cancer that 
      is associated with a significant risk of death from prostate cancer.

TI  - Targeting Exercise Interventions to Patients With Cancer in Need: An Individual 
      Patient Data Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1190-1200
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djy161 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exercise effects in cancer patients often appear modest, possibly 
      because interventions rarely target patients most in need. This study investigated 
      the moderator effects of baseline values on the exercise outcomes of fatigue, 
      aerobic fitness, muscle strength, quality of life (QoL), and self-reported physical 
      function (PF) in cancer patients during and post-treatment. METHODS: Individual 
      patient data from 34 randomized exercise trials (n = 4519) were pooled. Linear 
      mixed-effect models were used to study moderator effects of baseline values on 
      exercise intervention outcomes and to determine whether these moderator effects 
      differed by intervention timing (during vs post-treatment). All statistical tests 
      were two-sided. RESULTS: Moderator effects of baseline fatigue and PF were 
      consistent across intervention timing, with greater effects in patients with worse 
      fatigue (Pinteraction = .05) and worse PF (Pinteraction = .003). Moderator effects 
      of baseline aerobic fitness, muscle strength, and QoL differed by intervention 
      timing. During treatment, effects on aerobic fitness were greater for patients with 
      better baseline aerobic fitness (Pinteraction = .002). Post-treatment, effects on 
      upper (Pinteraction < .001) and lower (Pinteraction = .01) body muscle strength and 
      QoL (Pinteraction < .001) were greater in patients with worse baseline values. 
      CONCLUSION: Although exercise should be encouraged for most cancer patients during 
      and post-treatments, targeting specific subgroups may be especially beneficial and 
      cost effective. For fatigue and PF, interventions during and post-treatment should 
      target patients with high fatigue and low PF. During treatment, patients experience 
      benefit for muscle strength and QoL regardless of baseline values; however, only 
      patients with low baseline values benefit post-treatment. For aerobic fitness, 
      patients with low baseline values do not appear to benefit from exercise during 
      treatment.

TI  - Change in FEV(1) and Feno Measurements as Predictors of Future Asthma Outcomes in 
      Children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeated measurements of spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric oxide 
      (Feno) are recommended as part of the management of childhood asthma, but the 
      evidence base for such recommendations is small. We tested the hypothesis that 
      reducing spirometric indices or increasing Feno will predict poor future asthma 
      outcomes. METHODS: A one-stage individual patient data meta-analysis used data from 
      seven randomized controlled trials in which Feno was used to guide asthma treatment; 
      spirometric indices were also measured. Change in %FEV(1) and % change in Feno 
      between baseline and 3 months were related to having poor asthma control and to 
      having an asthma exacerbation between 3 and 6 months after baseline. RESULTS: Data 
      were available from 1,112 children (mean age, 12.6 years; mean %FEV(1), 94%). A 
      10% reduction in %FEV(1) between baseline and 3 months was associated with 
      28% increased odds for asthma exacerbation (95% CI, 3-58) and with 21% increased 
      odds for having poor asthma control (95% CI, 0-45) 6 months after baseline. A 
      50% increase in Feno between baseline and 3 months was associated with 11% increase 
      in odds for poor asthma control 6 months after baseline (95% CI, 0-16). Baseline 
      Feno and %FEV(1) were not related to asthma outcomes at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Repeated measurements of %FEV(1) that are typically within the "normal" range add to 
      clinical risk assessment of future asthma outcomes in children. The role of repeated 
      Feno measurements is less certain because large changes were associated with small 
      changes in outcome risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical benefit of aspirin for the primary prevention of 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes remains uncertain. To evaluate the efficacy 
      and safety of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes and 
      all-cause mortality events in people with diabetes, we conducted an updated 
      meta-analysis of published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and a pooled analysis 
      of individual participant data (IPD) from three trials. METHODS: Randomised 
      controlled trials of aspirin compared with placebo (or no treatment) in participants 
      with diabetes with no known CVD were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane 
      Library, and manual search of bibliographies to January 2019. Relative risks with 
      95% confidence intervals were used as the summary measures of associations. RESULTS: 
      We included 12 RCTs based on 34,227 participants with a median treatment duration of 
      5.0 years. Comparing aspirin use with no aspirin, there was a significant reduction 
      in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)0.89 (0.83-0.95), with a number 
      needed to treat (NNT)of 95 (95% CI 61 to 208) to prevent one MACE over 5 years 
      average follow-up. Evidence was lacking of heterogeneity and publication bias among 
      contributing trials for MACE. Aspirin use had no effect on other endpoints including 
      all-cause mortality; however, there was a significant reduction in stroke for 
      aspirin dosage ≤ 100 mg/day 0.75 (0.59-0.95). There were no significant effects of 
      aspirin use on major bleeding and other bleeding events, though some of the 
      estimates were imprecise. Pooled IPD from the three trials (2306 participants) 
      showed no significant evidence of an effect of aspirin on any of the outcomes 
      evaluated; however, aspirin reduced the risk of MACE in non-smokers 0.70 (0.51-0.96) 
      with a NNT of 33 (95% CI 20 to 246) to prevent one MACE. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin has 
      potential benefits in cardiovascular primary prevention in diabetes. The use of low 
      dose aspirin may need to be individualised and based on each individual's baseline 
      CVD and bleeding risk. Systematic review registration PROSPERO: CRD42019122326.

TI  - Association of Time From Stroke Onset to Groin Puncture With Quality of Reperfusion 
      After Mechanical Thrombectomy: A Meta-analysis of Individual Patient Data From 7 
      Randomized Clinical Trials.
PG  - 405-411
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.4510 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Reperfusion is a key factor for clinical outcome in patients with acute 
      ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for large-vessel 
      intracranial occlusion. However, data are scarce on the association between the time 
      from onset and reperfusion results. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the rate of reperfusion 
      after EVT started at different intervals after symptom onset in patients with AIS. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a meta-analysis of individual 
      patient data from 7 randomized trials of the Highly Effective Reperfusion Using 
      Multiple Endovascular Devices (HERMES) group. This is a multicenter cohort study of 
      the intervention arm of randomized clinical trials included in the HERMES group. 
      Patients with anterior circulation AIS who underwent EVT for M1/M2 or intracranial 
      carotid artery occlusion were included. Each trial enrolled patients according to 
      its specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data on patients eligible but not 
      enrolled (eg, refusals or exclusions) were not available. All analyses were 
      performed by the HERMES biostatistical core laboratory using the pooled database. 
      Data were analyzed between December 2010 and April 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Successful reperfusion was defined as a modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 
      score of 2b/3 at the end of the EVT procedure adjusted for age, occlusion location, 
      pretreatment intravenous thrombolysis, and clot burden score and was analyzed in 
      relation to different intervals (onset, emergency department arrival, imaging, and 
      puncture) using mixed-methods logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 728 included 
      patients, with a mean (SD) age of 65.4 (13.5) years and of whom 345 were female 
      (47.4%), decreases in rates of successful reperfusion defined as a thrombolysis in 
      cerebral infarction score of 2b/3 were observed with increasing time from admission 
      or first imaging to groin puncture. The magnitude of effect was a 22% relative 
      reduction (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95) per additional hour between 
      admission and puncture and a 26% relative reduction (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 
      0.59-0.93) per additional hour between imaging and puncture. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Because the probability of reperfusion declined significantly with time 
      between hospital arrival and groin puncture, we provide additional arguments for 
      minimizing the intervals after symptom onset in anterior circulation acute ischemic 
      stroke.

TI  - What Is the Best Treatment of Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma? An 
      Individual Patient Data Network Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 498-505
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2016.67.4119 [doi]
AB  - Purpose The role of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) or induction chemotherapy (IC) in the 
      treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma is controversial. The 
      individual patient data from the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Nasopharynx 
      Carcinoma database were used to compare all available treatments. Methods All 
      randomized trials of radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy in nonmetastatic 
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma were considered. Overall, 20 trials and 5,144 patients were 
      included. Treatments were grouped into seven categories: RT alone (RT), IC followed 
      by RT (IC-RT), RT followed by AC (RT-AC), IC followed by RT followed by AC 
      (IC-RT-AC), concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT), IC followed by CRT (IC-CRT), and 
      CRT followed by AC (CRT-AC). P-score was used to rank the treatments. Fixed- and 
      random-effects frequentist network meta-analysis models were applied. Results The 
      three treatments with the highest probability of benefit on overall survival (OS) 
      were CRT-AC, followed by CRT and IC-CRT, with respective hazard ratios (HRs [95% 
      CIs]) compared with RT alone of 0.65 (0.56 to 0.75), 0.77 (0.64 to 0.92), and 0.81 
      (0.63 to 1.04). HRs (95% CIs) of CRT-AC compared with CRT for OS, progression-free 
      survival (PFS), locoregional control, and distant control (DC) were, respectively, 
      0.85 (0.68 to 1.05), 0.81 (0.66 to 0.98), 0.70 (0.48 to 1.02), and 0.87 (0.61 to 
      1.25). IC-CRT ranked second for PFS and the best for DC. CRT never ranked first. HRs 
      of CRT compared with IC-CRT for OS, PFS, locoregional control, and DC were, 
      respectively, 0.95 (0.72 to 1.25), 1.13 (0.88 to 1.46), 1.05 (0.70 to 1.59), and 
      1.55 (0.94 to 2.56). Regimens with more chemotherapy were associated with increased 
      risk of acute toxicity. Conclusion The addition of AC to CRT achieved the highest 
      survival benefit and consistent improvement for all end points. The addition of IC 
      to CRT achieved the highest effect on DC.

TI  - Antiplatelet agents for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications.
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD004659.pub3 [doi]
LID - CD004659
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of 
      prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a 
      vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the 
      hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, low-dose aspirin in particular, might prevent 
      or delay development of pre-eclampsia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and 
      safety of antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and dipyridamole, when given to women 
      at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched 
      Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO 
      International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 March 2018), and 
      reference lists of retrieved studies. We updated the search in September 2019 and 
      added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. SELECTION 
      CRITERIA: All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or 
      no antiplatelet agent were included. Studies only published in abstract format were 
      eligible for inclusion if sufficient information was available. We would have 
      included cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with 
      individually-randomised trials, if any had been identified in our search strategy. 
      Quasi-random studies were excluded. Participants were pregnant women at risk of 
      developing pre-eclampsia. Interventions were administration of an antiplatelet agent 
      (such as low-dose aspirin or dipyridamole), comparisons were either placebo or no 
      antiplatelet. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed trials for 
      inclusion and extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk 
      ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For 
      this update we incorporated individual participant data (IPD) from trials with this 
      available, alongside aggregate data (AD) from trials where it was not, in order to 
      enable reliable subgroup analyses and inclusion of two key new outcomes. We assessed 
      risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using 
      GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-seven trials (40,249 women, and their babies) were 
      included, although three trials (relating to 233 women) did not contribute data to 
      the meta-analysis. Nine of the trials contributing data were large (> 1000 women 
      recruited), accounting for 80% of women recruited. Although the trials took place in 
      a wide range of countries, all of the nine large trials involved only women in 
      high-income and/or upper middle-income countries. IPD were available for 36 trials 
      (34,514 women), including all but one of the large trials. Low-dose aspirin alone 
      was the intervention in all the large trials, and most trials overall. Dose in the 
      large trials was 50 mg (1 trial, 1106 women), 60 mg (5 trials, 22,322 women), 75mg 
      (1 trial, 3697 women) 100 mg (1 trial, 3294 women) and 150 mg (1 trial, 1776 women). 
      Most studies were either low risk of bias or unclear risk of bias; and the large 
      trials were all low risk of bas. Antiplatelet agents versus placebo/no treatment The 
      use of antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of proteinuric pre-eclampsia by 18% 
      (36,716 women, 60 trials, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.88; high-quality evidence), 
      number needed to treat for one women to benefit (NNTB) 61 (95% CI 45 to 92). There 
      was a small (9%) reduction in the RR for preterm birth <37 weeks (35,212 women, 47 
      trials; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.95, high-quality evidence), NNTB 61 (95% CI 42 to 
      114), and a 14% reduction infetal deaths, neonatal deaths or death before hospital 
      discharge (35,391 babies, 52 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95; high-quality 
      evidence), NNTB 197 (95% CI 115 to 681). Antiplatelet agents slightly reduced the 
      risk of small-for-gestational age babies (35,761 babies, 50 trials; RR 0.84, 95% CI 
      0.76 to 0.92; high-quality evidence), NNTB 146 (95% CI 90 to 386), and pregnancies 
      with serious adverse outcome (a composite outcome including maternal death, baby 
      death, pre-eclampsia, small-for-gestational age, and preterm birth) (RR 0.90, 95% CI 
      0.85 to 0.96; 17,382 women; 13 trials, high-quality evidence), NNTB 54 (95% CI 34 to 
      132). Antiplatelet agents probably slightly increase postpartum haemorrhage > 500 mL 
      (23,769 women, 19 trials; RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12; moderate-quality evidence 
      due to clinical heterogeneity), and they probably marginally increase the risk of 
      placental abruption, although for this outcome the evidence was downgraded due to a 
      wide confidence interval including the possibility of no effect (30,775 women; 29 
      trials; RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.54; moderate-quality evidence). Data from two 
      large trials which assessed children at aged 18 months (including results from over 
      5000 children), did not identify clear differences in development between the two 
      groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Administering low-dose aspirin to pregnant women led 
      to small-to-moderate benefits, including reductions in pre-eclampsia (16 fewer per 
      1000 women treated), preterm birth (16 fewer per 1000 treated), the baby being born 
      small-for-gestational age (seven fewer per 1000 treated) and fetal or neonatal death 
      (five fewer per 1000 treated). Overall, administering antiplatelet agents to 1000 
      women led to 20 fewer pregnancies with serious adverse outcomes. The quality of 
      evidence for all these outcomes was high. Aspirin probably slightly increased the 
      risk of postpartum haemorrhage of more than 500 mL, however, the quality of evidence 
      for this outcome was downgraded to moderate, due to concerns of clinical 
      heterogeneity in measurements of blood loss. Antiplatelet agents probably marginally 
      increase placental abruption, but the quality of the evidence was downgraded to 
      moderate due to low event numbers and thus wide 95% CI. Overall, antiplatelet agents 
      improved outcomes, and at these doses appear to be safe. Identifying women who are 
      most likely to respond to low-dose aspirin would improve targeting of treatment. As 
      almost all the women in this review were recruited to the trials after 12 weeks' 
      gestation, it is unclear whether starting treatment before 12 weeks' would have 
      additional benefits without any increase in adverse effects. While there was some 
      indication that higher doses of aspirin would be more effective, further studies 
      would be warranted to examine this.

TI  - Glucocorticosteroids for people with alcoholic hepatitis.
PG  - CD001511
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub3 [doi]
LID - CD001511
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcoholic hepatitis is a form of alcoholic liver disease, characterised 
      by steatosis, necroinflammation, fibrosis, and potential complications to the liver 
      disease. Typically, alcoholic hepatitis presents in people between 40 and 50 years 
      of age. Alcoholic hepatitis can be resolved if people abstain from drinking, but the 
      risk of death will depend on the severity of the liver damage and abstinence from 
      alcohol. Glucocorticosteroids are used as anti-inflammatory drugs for people with 
      alcoholic hepatitis. Glucocorticosteroids have been studied extensively in 
      randomised clinical trials in order to assess their benefits and harms. However, the 
      results have been contradictory. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of 
      glucocorticosteroids in people with alcoholic hepatitis. SEARCH METHODS: We 
      identified trials through electronic searches in Cochrane Hepato-Biliary's (CHB) 
      Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation 
      Index Expanded. We looked for ongoing or unpublished trials in clinical trials 
      registers and pharmaceutical company sources. We also scanned reference lists of the 
      studies retrieved. The last search was 20 October 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: 
      Randomised clinical trials assessing glucocorticosteroids versus placebo or no 
      intervention in people with alcoholic hepatitis, irrespective of year, language of 
      publication, or format. We considered trials with adult participants diagnosed with 
      alcoholic hepatitis, which could have been established through clinical or 
      biochemical diagnostic criteria or both. We defined alcoholic hepatitis as mild 
      (Maddrey's score less than 32) and severe (Maddrey's score 32 or more). We allowed 
      co-interventions in the trial groups, provided they were similar. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: We followed Cochrane and CHB methodology, performing the meta-analyses 
      using Review Manager 5 and Trial Sequential Analysis. We presented the results of 
      dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and those of the continuous outcomes as 
      mean difference (MD). We applied both the fixed-effect model and the random-effects 
      model meta-analyses. Whenever there were significant discrepancies in the results, 
      we reported the more conservative point estimate of the two. We considered a P value 
      of 0.01 or less, two-tailed, as statistically significant if the required 
      information size was reached due to our three primary outcomes (all-cause mortality, 
      health-related quality of life, and serious adverse events during treatment) and our 
      post hoc decision to include analyses of mortality at more time points. We presented 
      heterogeneity using the I² statistic. If trialists used intention-to-treat analysis 
      to deal with missing data, we used these data in our primary analysis; otherwise, we 
      used the available data. We assessed the bias risk of the trials using bias risk 
      domains and the quality of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen trials 
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All trials were at high risk of bias. Fifteen 
      trials provided data for analysis (927 participants received glucocorticosteroids 
      and 934 participants received placebo or no intervention). The glucocorticosteroids 
      were administered orally or parenterally for a median of 28 days (range 3 days to 12 
      weeks). The participants were between 25 and 70 years old, had different stages of 
      alcoholic liver disease, and 65% were men. The follow-up of trial participants, when 
      it was reported, was up to the moment of discharge from the hospital, until they 
      died (a median of 63 days), or for at least a year. There was no evidence of effect 
      of glucocorticosteroids on all-cause mortality up to three months following 
      randomisation neither with traditional meta-analysis (random-effects RR 0.90, 95% CI 
      0.70 to 1.15; participants = 1861; trials = 15; I² = 45% (moderate heterogeneity) 
      nor with Trial Sequential Analysis. Meta-analysis showed no evidence of effect on 
      health-related quality of life up to three months (MD -0.04 points; 95% CI -0.11 to 
      0.03; participants = 377; trial = 1; low-quality evidence), measured with the 
      European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions-3 Levels (EQ- 5D-3L) scale. There was no 
      evidence of effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events during treatment, 
      neither with traditional meta-analysis (random-effects RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; 
      participants = 1861; trials = 15; I² = 36% (moderate heterogeneity), liver-related 
      mortality up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 0.89, 95% CI 
      0.69 to 1.14; participants = 1861; trials = 15; I² = 46% (moderate heterogeneity), 
      frequency of any complications up to three months following randomisation 
      (random-effects RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; participants = 1861; I² = 42% 
      (moderate heterogeneity), and frequency of non-serious adverse events up to three 
      months' follow-up after end of treatment (random-effects RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 
      5.48; participants = 160; trials = 4; I² = 0% (no heterogeneity) nor with Trial 
      Sequential Analysis. Nine of the trials were industry-funded. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: 
      We found no evidence of a difference between glucocorticosteroids and placebo or no 
      intervention on all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life, and serious 
      adverse events during treatment. The risk of bias was high and the quality of 
      evidence was very low or low. Therefore, we are very uncertain about this effect 
      estimate. Due to inadequate reporting, we cannot exclude increases in adverse 
      events. As the confidence intervals were wide, we cannot rule out significant 
      benefits and harms of glucocorticosteroids. Therefore, we need placebo-controlled, 
      randomised clinical trials, designed according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported 
      according to the CONSORT guidelines. Future trials ought to report depersonalised 
      individual participant data, so that proper individual participant data 
      meta-analyses of the effects of glucocorticosteroids in subgroups can be conducted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This is the third updated version of a Cochrane review first published 
      in Issue 4, 2003 of The Cochrane Library and first updated in 2007. Morphine has 
      been used for many years to relieve pain. Oral morphine in either immediate release 
      or modified release form remains the analgesic of choice for moderate or severe 
      cancer pain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of oral morphine in relieving 
      cancer pain, and to assess the incidence and severity of adverse events. SEARCH 
      METHODS: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9); MEDLINE (1966 to October 2015); and 
      EMBASE (1974 to October 2015). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov (1 October 2015). 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using placebo or 
      active comparators reporting on the analgesic effect of oral morphine in adults and 
      children with cancer pain. We excluded trials with fewer than 10 participants. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author extracted data, which were checked by 
      another review author. There were insufficient comparable data for meta-analysis to 
      be undertaken or to produce numbers needed to treat (NNTs) for the analgesic effect. 
      We extracted any available data on the number or proportion of participants with 'no 
      worse than mild pain' or treatment success (very satisfied, or very good or 
      excellent on patient global impression scales). MAIN RESULTS: We identified seven 
      new studies in this update. We excluded six, and one study is ongoing so also not 
      included in this update. This review contains a total of 62 included studies, with 
      4241 participants. Thirty-six studies used a cross-over design ranging from one to 
      15 days, with the greatest number (11) for seven days for each arm of the trial. 
      Overall we judged the included studies to be at high risk of bias because the 
      methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were poorly reported. The 
      primary outcomes for this review were participant-reported pain and pain 
      relief.Fifteen studies compared oral morphine modified release (Mm/r) preparations 
      with morphine immediate release (MIR). Fourteen studies compared Mm/r in different 
      strengths; six of these included 24-hour modified release products. Fifteen studies 
      compared Mm/r with other opioids. Six studies compared MIR with other opioids. Two 
      studies compared oral Mm/r with rectal Mm/r. Three studies compared MIR with MIR by 
      a different route of administration. Two studies compared Mm/r with Mm/r at 
      different times and two compared MIR with MIR given at a different time. One study 
      was found comparing each of the following: Mm/r tablet with Mm/r suspension; Mm/r 
      with non-opioids; MIR with non-opioids; and oral morphine with epidural morphine.In 
      the previous update, a standard of 'no worse than mild pain' was set, equivalent to 
      a score of 30/100 mm or less on a visual analogue pain intensity scale (VAS), or the 
      equivalent in other pain scales. Eighteen studies achieved this level of pain relief 
      on average, and no study reported that good levels of pain relief were not attained. 
      Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies, 'no worse 
      than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome 
      equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638).Morphine is an effective analgesic 
      for cancer pain. Pain relief did not differ between Mm/r and MIR. Modified release 
      versions of morphine were effective for 12- or 24-hour dosing depending on the 
      formulation. Daily doses in studies ranged from 25 mg to 2000 mg with an average of 
      between 100 mg and 250 mg. Dose titration was undertaken with both instant release 
      and modified release products. A small number of participants did not achieve 
      adequate analgesia with morphine. Adverse events were common, predictable, and 
      approximately 6% of participants discontinued treatment with morphine because of 
      intolerable adverse events.The quality of the evidence is generally poor. Studies 
      are old, often small, and were largely carried out for registration purposes and 
      therefore were only designed to show equivalence between different formulations. 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The conclusions have not changed for this update. The 
      effectiveness of oral morphine has stood the test of time, but the randomised trial 
      literature for morphine is small given the importance of this medicine. Most trials 
      recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide appropriate data for 
      meta-analysis. Only a few reported how many people had good pain relief, but where 
      it was reported, over 90% had no worse than mild pain within a reasonably short time 
      period. The review demonstrates the wide dose range of morphine used in studies, and 
      that a small percentage of participants are unable to tolerate oral morphine. The 
      review also shows the wide range of study designs, and inconsistency in cross-over 
      designs. Trial design was frequently based on titration of morphine or comparator to 
      achieve adequate analgesia, then crossing participants over in cross-over design 
      studies. It was not clear if these trials were sufficiently powered to detect any 
      clinical differences between formulations or comparator drugs. New studies added to 
      the review for the previous update reinforced the view that it is possible to use 
      modified release morphine to titrate to analgesic effect. There is qualitative 
      evidence that oral morphine has much the same efficacy as other available opioids.

AB  - Intestinal parasites affect millions of children globally. We aimed to assess 
      effects of deworming children on nutritional and cognitive outcomes across potential 
      effect modifiers using individual participant data (IPD). We searched multiple 
      databases to 27 March 2018, grey literature, and other sources. We included 
      randomised and quasi randomised trials of deworming compared to placebo or other 
      nutritional interventions with data on baseline infection. We used 
      a random-effects network meta-analysis with IPD and assessed overall quality, 
      following a pre-specified protocol. We received IPD from 19 trials of STH deworming. 
      Overall risk of bias was low. There were no statistically significant subgroup 
      effects across age, sex, nutritional status or infection intensity for each type of 
      STH. These analyses showed that children with moderate or heavy 
      intensity infections, deworming for STH may increase weight gain (very low 
      certainty). The added value of this review is an exploration of effects on growth 
      and cognition in children with moderate to heavy infections as well as replicating 
      prior systematic review results of small effects at the population level. Policy 
      implications are that complementary public health strategies need to be assessed and 
      considered to achieve growth and cognition benefits for children in helminth endemic 
      areas.

TI  - Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Markers of Vascular Function: A Systematic 
      Review and Individual Participant Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.117.008273 [doi]
LID - e008273
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of 
      cardiovascular events, but the effect of vitamin D supplementation on markers of 
      vascular function associated with major adverse cardiovascular events is unclear. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a systematic review and individual participant 
      meta-analysis to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on flow-mediated 
      dilatation of the brachial artery, pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, central 
      blood pressure, microvascular function, and reactive hyperemia index. MEDLINE, 
      CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and 
      http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov were searched until the end of 2016 without language 
      restrictions. Placebo-controlled randomized trials of at least 4 weeks duration were 
      included. Individual participant data were sought from investigators on included 
      trials. Trial-level meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models; 
      individual participant meta-analyses used a 2-stage analytic strategy, examining 
      effects in prespecified subgroups. 31 trials (2751 participants) were included; 29 
      trials (2641 participants) contributed data to trial-level meta-analysis, and 24 
      trials (2051 participants) contributed to individual-participant analyses. Vitamin 
      D3 daily dose equivalents ranged from 900 to 5000 IU; duration was 4 weeks to 
      12 months. Trial-level meta-analysis showed no significant effect of supplementation 
      on macrovascular measures (flow-mediated dilatation, 0.37% [95% confidence interval, 
      -0.23 to 0.97]; carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, 0.00 m/s [95% confidence 
      interval, -0.36 to 0.37]); similar results were obtained from individual participant 
      data. Microvascular function showed a modest improvement in trial-level data only. 
      No consistent benefit was observed in subgroup analyses or between different vitamin 
      D analogues. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on 
      most markers of vascular function in this analysis.

TI  - Do self-management interventions in COPD patients work and which patients benefit 
      most? An individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 2063-74
LID - 10.2147/COPD.S107884 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management interventions are considered effective in patients with 
      COPD, but trials have shown inconsistent results and it is unknown which patients 
      benefit most. This study aimed to summarize the evidence on effectiveness of 
      self-management interventions and identify subgroups of COPD patients who benefit 
      most. METHODS: Randomized trials of self-management interventions between 1985 and 
      2013 were identified through a systematic literature search. Individual patient data 
      of selected studies were requested from principal investigators and analyzed in an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis using generalized mixed effects models. 
      RESULTS: Fourteen trials representing 3,282 patients were included. Self-management 
      interventions improved health-related quality of life at 12 months (standardized 
      mean difference 0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.00-0.16) and time to first 
      respiratory-related hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.94) and 
      all-cause hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.90), but had no effect 
      on mortality. Prespecified subgroup analyses showed that interventions were more 
      effective in males (6-month COPD-related hospitalization: interaction P=0.006), 
      patients with severe lung function (6-month all-cause hospitalization: interaction 
      P=0.016), moderate self-efficacy (12-month COPD-related hospitalization: interaction 
      P=0.036), and high body mass index (6-month COPD-related hospitalization: 
      interaction P=0.028 and 6-month mortality: interaction P=0.026). In none of these 
      subgroups, a consistent effect was shown on all relevant outcomes. CONCLUSION: 
      Self-management interventions exert positive effects in patients with COPD on 
      respiratory-related and all-cause hospitalizations and modest effects on 12-month 
      health-related quality of life, supporting the implementation of self-management 
      strategies in clinical practice. Benefits seem similar across the subgroups studied 
      and limiting self-management interventions to specific patient subgroups cannot be 
      recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of exercise interventions on sleep disturbances 
      and sleep quality in patients with mixed cancer diagnoses, and identify demographic, 
      clinical, and intervention-related moderators of these effects. METHODS: Individual 
      patient data (IPD) and aggregated meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs). Using data from the Predicting OptimaL cAncer RehabIlitation and Supportive 
      care project, IPD of 2173 adults (mean age = 54.8) with cancer from 17 RCTs were 
      analyzed. A complementary systematic search was conducted (until November 2018) to 
      study the overall effects and test the representativeness of analyzed IPD. Effect 
      sizes of exercise effects on self-reported sleep outcomes were calculated for all 
      included RCTs. Linear mixed-effect models were used to evaluate the effects of 
      exercise on post-intervention outcome values, adjusting for baseline values. 
      Moderator effects were studied by testing interactions for demographic, clinical and 
      intervention-related characteristics. RESULTS: For all 27 eligible RCTs from the 
      updated search, exercise interventions significantly decreased sleep disturbances in 
      adults with cancer (g = -0.09, 95% CI [-0.16; -0.02]). No significant effect was 
      obtained for sleep quality. RCTs included in IPD analyses constituted a 
      representative sample of the published literature. The intervention effects on sleep 
      disturbances were not significantly moderated by any demographic, clinical, or 
      intervention-related factor, nor by sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      meta-analysis provides some evidence that, compared to control conditions, exercise 
      interventions may improve sleep disturbances, but not sleep quality, in cancer 
      patients, although this effect is of a small magnitude. Among the investigated 
      variables, none was found to significantly moderate the effect of exercise 
      interventions on sleep disturbances.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fear of childbirth is a problematic mental health issue during 
      pregnancy. But, effective interventions to reduce this problem are not well 
      understood. OBJECTIVES: To examine effective interventions for reducing fear of 
      childbirth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials, PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO were searched since inception till September 
      2017 without any restriction. Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised 
      controlled trials comparing interventions for treatment of fear of childbirth were 
      included. The standardized mean differences were pooled using random and fixed 
      effect models. The heterogeneity was determined using the Cochran's test and I(2) 
      index and was further explored in meta-regression model and subgroup analyses. 
      RESULTS: Ten studies inclusive of 3984 participants were included in the 
      meta-analysis (2 quasi-randomized and 8 randomized clinical trials). Eight studies 
      investigated education and two studies investigated hypnosis-based intervention. The 
      pooled standardized mean differences of fear for the education intervention and 
      hypnosis group in comparison with control group were -0.46 (95% CI -0.73 to -0.19) 
      and -0.22 (95% CI -0.34 to -0.10), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both types of 
      interventions were effective in reducing fear of childbirth; however our pooled 
      results revealed that educational interventions may reduce fear with double the 
      effect of hypnosis. Further large scale randomized clinical trials and individual 
      patient data meta-analysis are warranted for assessing the association.

TI  - The Impact of Dietary Protein or Amino Acid Supplementation on Muscle Mass and 
      Strength in Elderly People: Individual Participant Data and Meta-Analysis of RCT's.
PG  - 994-1001
LID - 10.1007/s12603-017-0896-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increasing protein or amino acid intake has been promoted as a promising 
      strategy to increase muscle mass and strength in elderly people, however, long-term 
      intervention studies show inconsistent findings. Therefore, we aim to determine the 
      impact of protein or amino acid supplementation compared to placebo on muscle mass 
      and strength in older adults by combining the results from published trials in a 
      meta-analysis and pooled individual participant data analysis. DESIGN: We searched 
      Medline and Cochrane databases and performed a meta-analysis on eight available 
      trials on the effect of protein or amino acid supplementation on muscle mass and 
      strength in older adults. Furthermore, we pooled individual data of six of these 
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials. The main outcomes were change in 
      lean body mass and change in muscle strength for both the meta-analysis and the 
      pooled analysis. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of eight studies (n=557) showed no 
      significant positive effects of protein or amino acid supplementation on lean body 
      mass (mean difference: 0.014 kg: 95% CI -0.152; 0.18), leg press strength (mean 
      difference: 2.26 kg: 95% CI -0.56; 5.08), leg extension strength (mean difference: 
      0.75 kg: 95% CI: -1.96, 3.47) or handgrip strength (mean difference: -0.002 kg: 95% 
      CI -0.182; 0.179). Likewise, the pooled analysis showed no significant difference 
      between protein and placebo treatment on lean body mass (n=412: p=0.78), leg press 
      strength (n=121: p=0.50), leg extension strength (n=121: p=0.16) and handgrip 
      strength (n=318: p=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no evidence to suggest 
      that protein or amino acid supplementation without concomitant nutritional or 
      exercise interventions increases muscle mass or strength in predominantly healthy 
      elderly people.

AB  - Biomarkers that predict treatment effects may be used to guide treatment decisions, 
      thus improving patient outcomes. A meta-analysis of individual participant data 
      (IPD) is potentially more powerful than a single-study data analysis in evaluating 
      markers for treatment selection. Our study was motivated by the IPD that were 
      collected from 2 randomized controlled trials of hypertension and preeclampsia among 
      pregnant women to evaluate the effect of labor induction over expectant management 
      of the pregnancy in preventing progression to severe maternal disease. The existing 
      literature on statistical methods for biomarker evaluation in IPD meta-analysis have 
      evaluated a marker's performance in terms of its ability to predict risk of disease 
      outcome, which do not directly apply to the treatment selection problem. In this 
      study, we propose a statistical framework for evaluating a marker for treatment 
      selection given IPD from a small number of individual clinical trials. We derive 
      marker-based treatment rules by minimizing the average expected outcome across 
      studies. The application of the proposed methods to the IPD from 2 studies in women 
      with hypertension in pregnancy is presented.

TI  - Predictors of placebo response to local (intra-articular) therapy in osteoarthritis: 
      an individual patient data meta-analysis protocol.
PG  - e027372

LID - e027372
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent and disabling condition with 
      limited safe and effective treatment options. Intra-articular therapies are 
      increasingly being used, however whether the effect of these agents is due to active 
      treatment or placebo remains unclear. As the placebo response can be attributed to 
      multiple factors, assessment of the placebo response using individual patient data 
      (IPD) meta-analysis will give insight into the different modifiers of response to 
      placebo. The aim of this IPD meta-analysis is to investigate the predictors of 
      placebo response in intra-articular injection trials in OA. IPD meta-analysis is 
      considered to be superior to conventional meta-analysis, as it combines multiple 
      trial data, facilitates the standardisation of analyses across different studies and 
      allows measuring derivation of the desired information. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: A 
      systematic literature search will be conducted for randomised clinical trials 
      comparing corticosteroid and viscosupplementation/hyaluronic acid intra-articular 
      injections with placebo for knee and hip OA. Pubmed (Medline), EMBASE, Web of 
      Science, Cochrane Central and SCOPUS will be searched from inception to September 
      2018. Corresponding authors of the original trials will be contacted to obtain IPD. 
      Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. The primary 
      outcome will be change in pain from baseline. Secondary outcomes will be change in 
      function and patient's global assessment. Potential predictors of placebo response 
      assessed will include patient's characteristics, pain mechanism characteristics, 
      radiographic severity, pain severity, intervention characteristics and trial design 
      characteristics. A multilevel logistic regression analyses will be applied. Results 
      will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and 
      Meta-Analysis -IPD guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study does not include 
      identifiable data and ethical approval was obtained by the original investigators. 
      Results of the IPD meta-analysis will be disseminated for publication in 
      peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Insomnia in Alcohol-Dependent Patients: Prevalence, Risk Factors and Acamprosate 
      Effect: An Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 611-618
LID - 10.1093/alcalc/agy013 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The prevalence of insomnia ranges from 36% to 91% in alcohol-dependent 
      patients and may persist after alcohol withdrawal. Acamprosate has been shown to 
      decrease insomnia in abstinent patients. Based on a large clinical trial database, 
      the aim of the present study is to assess the efficacy of acamprosate in reducing 
      insomnia, and if indeed it does reduce insomnia, to better understand its action 
      mechanism. SHORT SUMMARY: The aim of the study is to confirm the efficacy of 
      acamprosate to reduce insomnia using an individual patient data meta-analysis. 
      Twelve studies were found including 3508 patients. After a 6-month follow-up, the 
      mean insomnia decrease over baseline was -26% and -45% for the placebo and 
      acamprosate groups, respectively (P < 0.001). METHODS: An individual patient data 
      meta-analysis selected all the randomized trials of acamprosate in which insomnia 
      was documented. Our main endpoint was insomnia change after a 6-month follow-up, 
      measured by the validated Short Sleep Index (SSI) derived from the Hamilton 
      Depression and Anxiety Scale. The meta-analysis was conducted using a two-level 
      multilevel (patient/trial) mixed model with random treatment effect, random study 
      effect and adjusting for baseline severity covariates. RESULTS: Twelve studies were 
      found including 3508 patients, 59.8% of whom were suffering from insomnia (95% CI 
      58.1-61.4). Psychiatric history, severe addiction, living alone and abnormal 
      gamma-GT levels were found to be the risk factors of insomnia. After 6 months, the 
      mean SSI decrease over baseline was -26% and -45% for placebo and acamprosate, 
      respectively (treatment effect = 19%, 12.5-25.5; P < 0.001). By using a univariate 
      mediation model, we found that the mediating effect of abstinence on insomnia 
      accounted for 55.7% of the overall effect of acamprosate on insomnia reduction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia is prevalent among alcohol-dependent patients. It decreases 
      spontaneously with abstinence but more frequently with acamprosate treatment.

TI  - Lifestyle Interventions Limit Gestational Weight Gain in Women with Overweight or 
      Obesity: LIFE-Moms Prospective Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1396-1404
LID - 10.1002/oby.22250 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of varied lifestyle intervention 
      programs designed to ameliorate excess gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant 
      women with overweight or obesity compared with standard care, including effects on 
      pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Seven clinical centers conducted separate randomized 
      clinical trials to test different lifestyle intervention strategies to modify GWG in 
      diverse populations. Eligibility criteria, specific outcome measures, and assessment 
      procedures were standardized across trials. The results of the separate trials were 
      combined using an individual-participant data meta-analysis. RESULTS: For the 1,150 
      women randomized, the percent with excess GWG per week was significantly lower in 
      the intervention group compared with the standard care group (61.8% vs. 75.0%; odds 
      ratio [95% CI]: 0.52 [0.40 to 0.67]). Total GWG from enrollment to 36 weeks' 
      gestation was also lower in the intervention group (8.1 ± 5.2 vs. 9.7 ± 5.4 kg; mean 
      difference: -1.59 kg [95% CI:-2.18 to -0.99 kg]). The results from the individual 
      trials were similar. The intervention and standard care groups did not differ in 
      preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, or birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Behavioral lifestyle interventions focusing primarily on diet and physical activity 
      among women with overweight and obesity resulted in a significantly lower proportion 
      of women with excess GWG. This modest beneficial effect was consistent across 
      diverse intervention modalities in a large, racially and socioeconomically diverse 
      US population of pregnant women.

TI  - The efficacy and heterogeneity of antipsychotic response in schizophrenia: A 
      meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1038/s41380-019-0502-5 [doi]
AB  - The response to antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia appears to vary, and as 
      such it has been proposed that different subtypes of schizophrenia exist, defined by 
      treatment-response. This has not been formally examined using meta-analysis. 
      Randomised controlled trials comparing placebo and antipsychotics in acute treatment 
      of schizophrenia listed in PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO from inception until 30 
      November 2018 were examined. Relative variability of symptomatic improvement in 
      antipsychotic-treated individuals compared to placebo-treated individuals was 
      quantified using coefficient of variation ratio (CVR). Mean difference in symptom 
      change was quantified using Hedges' g. In addition, individual patient data from two 
      clinical trials was examined in terms of both the distribution of total symptom 
      change, and the variability of individual symptoms and symptom factors. In total, 
      11,006 articles were identified. Sixty six met inclusion criteria, reporting on 
      17,202 patients. Compared with placebo, antipsychotic-treated patients demonstrated 
      greater total symptom improvement (g = 0.47, p < 0.001) and reduced variability in 
      symptomatic improvement for total (CVR = 0.86, p < 0.001), positive (CVR = 0.89, 
      p < 0.001), and negative symptoms (CVR = 0.86, p = 0.001). Lower variability in 
      antipsychotic-response relative to placebo was associated with studies published 
      earlier (z = 3.98, p < 0.001), younger patients (z = 3.07, p = 0.002), higher dose 
      treatments (z = -2.62, p = 0.009), and greater mean-difference in symptom-change 
      (z = -5.70, p < 0.001). In the individual patient dataset (N = 522 patients), 
      antipsychotic treated patients did not show significantly increased variability for 
      any individual symptom, and there was no evidence of a bimodal distribution of 
      response. Compared to placebo, antipsychotic treatment shows greater improvement and 
      lower variability of change in total, positive and negative symptoms. This is 
      contrary to the hypothesis that there is a subtype of antipsychotic non-responsive 
      schizophrenia. Instead our findings, provide evidence for a relatively homogeneous 
      effect of antipsychotic treatment in improving symptoms of schizophrenia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal pain is a common and disabling condition with considerable 
      socioeconomic burden. Spine pain management in the United States has gathered 
      increased scrutiny amidst concerns of overutilization of costly and potentially 
      harmful interventions and diagnostic tests. Conservative interventions such as 
      spinal manipulation, exercise and self-management may provide value for the care of 
      spinal pain, but little is known regarding the cost-effectiveness of these 
      interventions in the U.S. Our primary objective for this project is to estimate the 
      incremental cost-effectiveness of spinal manipulation, exercise therapy, and 
      self-management for spinal pain using an individual patient data meta-analysis 
      approach. METHODS/DESIGN: We will estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of 
      spinal manipulation, exercise therapy, and self-management using cost and clinical 
      outcome data collected in eight randomized clinical trials performed in the U.S. 
      Cost-effectiveness will be assessed from both societal and healthcare perspectives 
      using QALYs, pain intensity, and disability as effectiveness measures. The eight 
      randomized clinical trials used similar methods and included different combinations 
      of spinal manipulation, exercise therapy, or self-management for spinal pain. They 
      also collected similar clinical outcome, healthcare utilization, and work 
      productivity data. A two-stage approach to individual patient data meta-analysis 
      will be conducted. DISCUSSION: This project capitalizes on a unique opportunity to 
      combine clinical and economic data collected in a several clinical trials that used 
      similar methods. The findings will provide important information on the value of 
      spinal manipulation, exercise therapy, and self-management for spinal pain 
      management in the U.S.

TI  - Protocolised Management In Sepsis (ProMISe): a multicentre randomised controlled 
      trial of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early, goal-directed, 
      protocolised resuscitation for emerging septic shock.
PG  - i-xxv, 1-150
LID - 10.3310/hta19970 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) is recommended in international 
      guidance for the resuscitation of patients presenting with early septic shock. 
      However, adoption has been limited and uncertainty remains over its clinical 
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to 
      estimate the effect of EGDT compared with usual resuscitation on mortality at 90 
      days following randomisation and on incremental cost-effectiveness at 1 year. The 
      secondary objectives were to compare EGDT with usual resuscitation for requirement 
      for, and duration of, critical care unit organ support; length of stay in the 
      emergency department (ED), critical care unit and acute hospital; health-related 
      quality of life, resource use and costs at 90 days and at 1 year; all-cause 
      mortality at 28 days, at acute hospital discharge and at 1 year; and estimated 
      lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: A pragmatic, open, multicentre, 
      parallel-group randomised controlled trial with an integrated economic evaluation. 
      SETTING: Fifty-six NHS hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1260 patients 
      who presented at EDs with septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: EGDT (n = 630) or usual 
      resuscitation (n = 630). Patients were randomly allocated 1 : 1. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: All-cause mortality at 90 days after randomisation and incremental net 
      benefit (at £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year) at 1 year. RESULTS: Following 
      withdrawals, data on 1243 (EGDT, n = 623; usual resuscitation, n = 620) patients 
      were included in the analysis. By 90 days, 184 (29.5%) in the EGDT and 181 (29.2%) 
      patients in the usual-resuscitation group had died [p = 0.90; absolute risk 
      reduction -0.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.4 to 4.7; relative risk 1.01, 95% 
      CI 0.85 to 1.20]. Treatment intensity was greater for the EGDT group, indicated by 
      the increased use of intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs and red blood cell 
      transfusions. Increased treatment intensity was reflected by significantly higher 
      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and more advanced cardiovascular support 
      days in critical care for the EGDT group. At 1 year, the incremental net benefit for 
      EGDT versus usual resuscitation was negative at -£725 (95% CI -£3000 to £1550). The 
      probability that EGDT was more cost-effective than usual resuscitation was below 
      30%. There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes, 
      including health-related quality of life, or adverse events. LIMITATIONS: 
      Recruitment was lower at weekends and out of hours. The intervention could not be 
      blinded. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality at 
      90 days for EGDT compared with usual resuscitation among adults identified with 
      early septic shock presenting to EDs in England. On average, costs were higher in 
      the EGDT group than in the usual-resuscitation group while quality-adjusted 
      life-years were similar in both groups; the probability that it is cost-effective is 
      < 30%. FUTURE WORK: The ProMISe (Protocolised Management In Sepsis) trial completes 
      the planned trio of evaluations of EGDT across the USA, Australasia and England; all 
      have indicated that EGDT is not superior to usual resuscitation. Recognising that 
      each of the three individual, large trials has limited power for evaluating

TI  - Burden of Metastatic Castrate Naive Prostate Cancer Patients, to Identify Men More 
      Likely to Benefit from Early Docetaxel: Further Analyses of CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 
      Studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Docetaxel (D) at the time of starting androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) 
      for metastatic castrate naive prostate cancer shows a clear survival benefit for 
      patients with high-volume (HV) disease. It is unclear whether patients with 
      low-volume (LV) disease benefit from early D. OBJECTIVE: To define the overall 
      survival (OS) of aggregate data of patient subgroups from the CHAARTED and 
      GETUG-AFU15 studies, defined by metastatic burden (HV and LV) and time of metastasis 
      occurrence (at diagnosis or after prior local treatment [PRLT]). DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were accessed from two independent phase III trials of ADT 
      alone or ADT+D-GETUG-AFU15 (N=385) and CHAARTED (N=790), with median follow-ups for 
      survivors of 83.2 and 48.2 mo, respectively. The definition of HV and LV disease was 
      harmonized. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary end point was 
      OS. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Meta-analysis results of the aggregate data showed 
      significant heterogeneity in ADT+D versus ADT effect sizes between HV and LV 
      subgroups (p=0.017), and failed to detect heterogeneity in ADT+D versus ADT effect 
      sizes between upfront and PRLT subgroups (p=0.4). Adding D in patients with HV 
      disease has a consistent effect in improving median OS (HV-ADT: 34.4 and 35.1 mo, 
      HV-ADT+D: 51.2 and 39.8 mo in CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15, respectively; pooled average 
      hazard ratio or HR (95% confidence interval [CI]) 0.68 ([95% CI 0.56; 0.82], 
      p<0.001). Patients with LV disease showed much longer OS, without evidence that D 
      improved OS (LV-ADT: not reached [NR] and 83.4; LV-ADT+D: 63.5 and NR in CHAARTED 
      and GETUG-AFU15, respectively; pooled HR (95% CI) 1.03 (95% CI 0.77; 1.38). 
      Aggregate data showed no evidence of heterogeneity of early D in LV and HV subgroups 
      irrespective of whether patients had PRLT or not. Post hoc subgroup analysis was 
      based on aggregated data from two independent phase III randomized trials. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There was no apparent survival benefit in the CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 
      studies with D for LV. Across both studies, early D showed consistent effect and 
      improved OS in HV patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: Patients with a higher burden of 
      metastatic prostate cancer starting androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have a poorer 
      prognosis and are more likely to benefit from early docetaxel. Low-volume patients 
      have longer overall survival with ADT alone, and the toxicity of docetaxel may 
      outweigh its benefits.

TI  - The effect of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation on routine haematological 
      parameters in older people: an individual participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - 785-795
LID - 10.1038/s41430-018-0118-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Low vitamin B12 and folate levels in community-dwelling older 
      people are usually corrected with supplements. However, the effect of this 
      supplementation on haematological parameters in older persons is not known. 
      Therefore, we executed a systematic review and individual participant data 
      meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). SUBJECTS/METHODS: We 
      performed a systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane and 
      CENTRAL for RCTs published between January 1950 and April 2016, where 
      community-dwelling elderly (60+ years) who were treated with vitamin B12 or folic 
      acid or placebo. The presence of anaemia was not required. We analysed the data on 
      haematological parameters with a two-stage IPD meta-analysis. RESULTS: We found 494 
      full papers covering 14 studies. Data were shared by the authors of four RCTs 
      comparing vitamin B12 with placebo (n = 343) and of three RCTs comparing folic acid 
      with placebo (n = 929). We found no effect of vitamin B12 supplementation on 
      haemoglobin (change 0.00 g/dL, 95% CI: -0.19;0.18), and no effect of folic acid 
      supplementation (change -0.09 g/dL, 95% CI: -0.19;0.01). The effects of 
      supplementation on other haematological parameters were similar. The effects did not 
      differ by sex or by age group. Also, no effect was found in a subgroup of patients 
      with anaemia and a subgroup of patients who were treated >4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Evidence on the effects of supplementation of low concentrations of vitamin B12 and 
      folate on haematological parameters in community-dwelling older people is 
      inconclusive. Further research is needed before firm recommendations can be made 
      concerning the supplementation of vitamin B12 and folate.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess evidence for 'legacy' (post-trial) effects on cardiovascular 
      disease (CVD) mortality and all-cause mortality among adult participants of 
      placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of statins. DESIGN: 
      Meta-analysis of aggregate data. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Placebo-controlled statin 
      RCTS for primary and secondary CVD prevention. METHODS: Data sources: PubMed, Embase 
      from inception and forward citations of Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' 
      Collaborators RCTs to 16 June 2016. STUDY SELECTION: Two independent reviewers 
      identified all statin RCT follow-up reports including ≥1000 participants, and 
      cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two 
      independent reviewers extracted data in accordance with the Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES: Post-trial 
      CVD and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: We included eight trials, with mean post-trial 
      follow-up ranging from 1.6 to 15.1 years, and including 13 781 post-trial deaths 
      (6685 CVD). Direct effects of statins within trials were greater than legacy effects 
      post-trials. The pooled data from all eight studies showed no evidence overall of 
      legacy effects on CVD mortality, but some evidence of legacy effects on all-cause 
      mortality (p=0.01). Exploratory subgroup analysis found possible differences in 
      legacy effect for primary prevention trials compared with secondary prevention 
      trials for both CVD mortality (p=0.15) and all-cause mortality (p=0.02). Pooled 
      post-trial HR for the three primary prevention studies demonstrated possible 
      post-trial legacy effects on CVD mortality (HR=0.87; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95) and on 
      all-cause mortality (HR=0.90; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Possible post-trial 
      statin legacy effects on all-cause mortality appear to be driven by the primary 
      prevention studies. Although these relative benefits were smaller than those 
      observed within the trial, the absolute benefits may be similar for the two time 
      periods. Analysis of individual patient data from follow-up studies after 
      placebo-controlled statin RCTs in lower-risk populations may provide more definitive 
      evidence on whether early treatment of subclinical atherosclerosis is likely to be 
      beneficial.

TI  - The FOCUS, AFFINITY and EFFECTS trials studying the effect(s) of fluoxetine in 
      patients with a recent stroke: statistical and health economic analysis plan for the 
      trials and for the individual patient data meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Small trials have suggested that fluoxetine may improve neurological 
      recovery from stroke. FOCUS, AFFINITY and EFFECTS are a family of investigator-led, 
      multicentre, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled trials which aim to 
      determine whether the routine administration of fluoxetine (20 mg daily) for six 
      months after an acute stroke improves patients' functional outcome. METHODS/DESIGN: 
      The core protocol for the three trials has been published (Mead et al., Trials 
      20:369, 2015). The trials include patients aged 18 years and older with a clinical 
      diagnosis of stroke and persisting focal neurological deficits at randomisation 2-15 
      days after stroke onset. Patients are randomised centrally via each trials' 
      web-based randomisation system using a common minimisation algorithm. Patients are 
      allocated fluoxetine 20 mg once daily or matching placebo capsules for six months. 
      The primary outcome measure is the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at six months. 
      Secondary outcomes include: living circumstances; the Stroke Impact Scale; EuroQol 
      (EQ5D-5 L); the vitality subscale of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF36); 
      diagnosis of depression; adherence to medication; serious adverse events including 
      death and recurrent stroke; and resource use at six and 12 months and the mRS at 
      12 months. DISCUSSION: Minor variations have been tailored to the national setting 
      in the UK (FOCUS), Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam (AFFINITY) and Sweden 
      (EFFECTS). Each trial is run and funded independently and will report its own 
      results. A prospectively planned individual patient data meta-analysis of all three 
      trials will provide the most precise estimate of the overall effect and establish 
      whether any effects differ between trials or subgroups. This statistical analysis 
      plan describes the core analyses for all three trials and that for the individual 
      patient data meta-analysis. Recruitment and follow-up in the FOCUS trial is expected 
      to be completed by the end of 2018. AFFINITY and EFFECTS are likely to complete 
      follow-up in 2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: FOCUS: ISRCTN , ISRCTN83290762 . Registered

TI  - Meta-analysis of individual patient data of albumin dialysis in acute-on-chronic

PG  - 1756284819879565
LID - 1756284819879565
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a common complication of 
      cirrhosis characterized by single or multiple organ failures and high short-term 
      mortality. Treatment of ACLF consists of standard medical care (SMC) and organ(s) 
      support. Whether the efficacy of artificial liver support (ALS) depends on the 
      severity of ACLF or on the intensity of this treatment, or both, is unclear. This 
      study aimed to further assess these issues. METHODS: We performed an individual 
      patient data meta-analysis assessing the efficacy of Molecular Adsorbent 
      Recirculating System (MARS) in ACLF patients enrolled in prior randomized control 
      trials (RCTs). The meta-analysis was designed to assess the effect of patient 
      severity (ACLF grade) and treatment intensity [low-intensity therapy (LIT), SMC 
      alone or SMC plus ⩽ 4 MARS sessions, high-intensity therapy (HIT), SMC plus > 4 MARS 
      sessions] on mortality. RESULTS: Three RCTs suitable for the meta-analysis (n = 285, 
      ACLF patients = 165) were identified in a systematic review. SMC plus MARS 
      (irrespective of the number of sessions) did not improve survival compared with SMC 
      alone, neither in the complete population nor in the ACLF patients. Survival, 
      however, was significantly improved in the subgroup of patients receiving HIT both 
      in the entire cohort (10-day survival: 98.6% versus 82.8%, p = 0.001; 30-day 
      survival: 73.9% versus 64.3%, p = 0.032) and within the ACLF patients (10-day 
      survival: 97.8% versus 78.6%, p = 0.001; 30-day survival: 73.3% versus 58.5%, 
      p = 0.041). Remarkably, HIT increased survival independently of ACLF grade. 
      Independent predictors of survival were age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 
      (MELD), ACLF grade, number of MARS sessions received, and intensity of MARS therapy. 
      CONCLUSION: HIT with albumin dialysis may improve survival in patients with ACLF. 
      Appropriate treatment schedules should be determined in future clinical trials.

PG  - e15300
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000015300 [doi]
LID - e15300
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous clinical studies have reported that furosemide can be used to 
      treat liver cirrhosis (LC) effectively. However, no study systematically explored 
      this issue. This systematic review aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
      furosemide for treatment of LC. METHODS: This study will be conducted through 
      searching the following literature sources from their inception to February 28, 2019 
      without any language limitations: PUBMED, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, 
      OpenGrey, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
      Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Chinese Biomedical 
      Literature Database. In addition, reference lists of relevant reviews and websites 
      of clinical trial registry will also be searched. Only randomized controlled trials 
      of furosemide for treatment of LC will be included in this study. Two reviewers will 
      independently select studies, collect data, and determine risk of bias. RevMan 5.3 
      software will be used to pool the data and to conduct meta-analysis if sufficient 
      studies will be included with acceptable heterogeneity. RESULTS: This study will 
      investigate the efficacy and safety of furosemide for LC by the assessment of 
      primary and secondary outcomes. The primary outcome includes mortality rate. The 
      secondary outcomes consist of response rate, overall survival, body weight, urinary 
      volume, quality of life, as measured by any relevant scales, and adverse events. 
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study may provide summarized evidence of furosemide 
      for the treatment of LC. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No individual patient data will 
      be used in this study, thus no ethics approval is needed. The findings of this study 
      will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

TI  - Efficacy of bisphosphonates in specific knee osteoarthritis subpopulations: protocol 
      for an OA Trial Bank systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - e023889
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023889 [doi]
LID - e023889
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Randomised clinical trials to date investigating the efficacy of 
      bisphosphonates in knee osteoarthritis (OA) have found divergent results, with a 
      recent meta-analysis finding no superiority of these drugs over placebo. Whether 
      particular patient subgroups are more likely to benefit from this therapy than 
      others is still unclear. We aim to investigate the effects of bisphosphonates 
      compared with a control group (placebo, no treatment, another active treatment) on 
      clinical and structural outcomes in specific knee OA subpopulations with possible 
      distinct rates of subchondral bone turnover. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Medline, Embase, 
      Scopus, Web of Sciences and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be 
      searched from inception to February 2018. Randomised clinical trials will be 
      eligible if they reported at least one potential treatment effect modifier at 
      baseline: gender, menopausal status, age, body mass index, radiographic stage, knee 
      pain severity, presence of bone marrow lesions, levels of biochemical markers of 
      bone turnover (serum and/or urinary) and systemic bone mineral density status. 
      Authors of original trials will be contacted to obtain individual patient data from 
      each study. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. 
      The primary outcomes will include pain and radiographic joint space width loss. 
      Studies using other MRI-based assessment of disease progression will also be 
      eligible. Outcomes will be grouped into short-term (≤3 months), intermediate-term 
      (>3 months; ≤12 months) and long-term (>12 months). Regression models will be used, 
      adding an interaction term for each subgroup of interest to determine possible 
      subgroup effects. There was no source of funding for this study. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Dissemination of our findings is planned to occur through conference 
      presentations, publication in peer-reviewed journals and social media. No formal 
      ethics approval is generally required as no new data collection will be undertaken.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of Osimertinib in the First-Line Treatment of Patients With 
      EGFR-Mutated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
PG  - 1080-1084
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1395 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations has improved 
      substantially in the last decade with the development of targeted tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (TKIs). Osimertinib, a third-generation TKI that is approved by the US 
      Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients who develop EGFR T790M 
      mutations, has recently shown improved clinical outcomes compared with gefitinib and 
      erlotinib for treatment-naive patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      assess the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib for the first-line treatment of 
      patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For this 
      cost-effectiveness analysis, we extracted individual patient data from the FLAURA 
      randomized clinical trial and used findings of our earlier meta-analysis to develop 
      a decision-analytic model and determine the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib 
      (AZD9291) compared with first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs over a 10-year time 
      horizon. All direct costs were based on US and Brazilian payer perspectives. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome of this study was the incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
      (QALY) gained by using osimertinib compared with first- or second-generation 
      EGFR-TKIs in previously untreated EGFR-mutated NSCLC. RESULTS: In the base case 
      using the data as reported in the FLAURA trial, the incremental QALY for osimertinib 
      was 0.594 compared with the first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. In the United 
      States, the osimertinib ICERs were $226 527 vs erlotinib, $231 123 vs gefitinib, and 
      $219 874 vs afatinib. In Brazil, the ICERs were $162 329, $180 804, and $175 432, 
      respectively. The overall survival (95% CI) reported in the FLAURA trial (hazard 
      ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.88) had the strongest association with the ICER (ranging 
      from $84 342 to $859 771). Osimertinib price adjustments to the FLAURA trial data 
      improved cost-effectiveness. For example, a discount of 10% on osimertinib 
      acquisition cost was associated with a 20% decreased ICER compared with the base 
      case ICER, and a discount of 20% on osimertinib acquisition cost was associated with 
      a 40% decreased ICER compared with the base case ICER. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: At 
      current costs, by World Health Organization cost-effectiveness threshold criteria, 
      osimertinib is not cost-effective for first-line therapy of EGFR-mutated NSCLC in 
      either the United States or Brazil.

LID - 10.1017/ice.2018.84 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVETo determine whether probiotic prophylaxes reduce the odds of Clostridium 
      difficile infection (CDI) in adults and children.DESIGNIndividual participant data 
      (IPD) meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), adjusting for risk 
      factors.METHODSWe searched 6 databases and 11 grey literature sources from inception 
      to April 2016. We identified 32 RCTs (n=8,713); among them, 18 RCTs provided IPD 
      (n=6,851 participants) comparing probiotic prophylaxis to placebo or no treatment 
      (standard care). One reviewer prepared the IPD, and 2 reviewers extracted data, 
      rated study quality, and graded evidence quality.RESULTSProbiotics reduced CDI odds 
      in the unadjusted model (n=6,645; odds ratio [OR] 0.37; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.25-0.55) and the adjusted model (n=5,074; OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.23-0.55). 
      Using 2 or more antibiotics increased the odds of CDI (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.11-4.37), 
      whereas age, sex, hospitalization status, and high-risk antibiotic exposure did not. 
      Adjusted subgroup analyses suggested that, compared to no probiotics, multispecies 
      probiotics were more beneficial than single-species probiotics, as was using 
      probiotics in clinical settings where the CDI risk is ≥5%. Of 18 studies, 14 
      reported adverse events. In 11 of these 14 studies, the adverse events were retained 
      in the adjusted model. Odds for serious adverse events were similar for both groups 
      in the unadjusted analyses (n=4,990; OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.89-1.26) and adjusted 
      analyses (n=4,718; OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.89-1.28). Missing outcome data for CDI ranged 
      from 0% to 25.8%. Our analyses were robust to a sensitivity analysis for 
      missingness.CONCLUSIONSModerate quality (ie, certainty) evidence suggests that 
      probiotic prophylaxis may be a useful and safe CDI prevention strategy, particularly 
      among participants taking 2 or more antibiotics and in hospital settings where the 
      risk of CDI is ≥5%.TRIAL REGISTRATIONPROSPERO 2015 identifier: CRD42015015701Infect

TI  - The association between blood pressure variability (BPV) with dementia and cognitive 
      function: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.
PG  - 163
LID - 10.1186/s13643-018-0811-9 [doi]
LID - 163
AB  - BACKGROUND: A body of empirical work demonstrates that wide fluctuations in a 
      person's blood pressure across consecutive measures, known as blood pressure 
      variability (BPV), hold prognostic value to predict stroke and transient ischemic 
      attack. However, the magnitude of association between BPV and other neurological 
      outcomes remains less clear. This systematic review aims to pool together data 
      regarding BPV with respect to incident dementia, cognitive impairment, and cognitive 
      function. METHODS: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS) will be 
      searched for the key words blood pressure variability and outcomes of dementia, 
      cognitive impairment, and cognitive function. Authors and reference lists of 
      included studies will also be contacted to identify additional published and 
      unpublished studies. Eligibility criteria are as follows: population-adult humans 
      (over 18 years but with no upper age limit) without dementia at baseline, with or 
      without elevated blood pressure, or from hypertensive populations (systolic blood 
      pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg or use of 
      antihypertensive drug for hypertension) and from primary care, community cohort, 
      electronic database registry, or randomized controlled trial (RCT); exposure-any 
      metric of BPV (systolic, diastolic or both) over any duration; comparison-persons 
      without dementia who do not have elevated BPV; and outcome-dementia, cognitive 
      impairment, cognitive function at follow-up from standardized neurological 
      assessment, or cognitive testing. Article screening will be undertaken by two 
      independent reviewers with disagreements resolved through discussion. Data 
      extraction will include original data specified as hazard ratios, odds ratios, 
      correlations, regression coefficients, and original cell data if available. Risk of 
      bias assessment will be undertaken by two independent reviewers. Meta-analytic 
      methods will be used to synthesize the data collected relating to the neurological 
      outcomes with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2.0 (Biostat Inc., Engelwood, NJ). 
      DISCUSSION: This systematic review aims to clarify whether BPV is associated with 
      elevated risk for dementia, cognitive impairment, and cognitive function. An 
      evaluation of the etiological links between BPV with incident dementia might inform 
      evidence-based clinical practice and policy concerning blood pressure measurement 
      and hypertension management. The review will identify sources of heterogeneity and 
      may inform decisions on whether it is feasible and desirable to proceed with an 
      individual participant data meta-analysis. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) can be effective in treating 
      chronic pain. Despite evidence supporting the effectiveness of ACT, uncertainties 
      remain regarding which subgroups in the chronic pain population are likely to 
      benefit most and least. This protocol describes the application for two 
      meta-analytic approaches, one at the level of individual participant data and the 
      other at the level of aggregated data, from randomized controlled trials of ACT for 
      chronic pain (ACT-CP-MA). METHODS: We will systematically conduct literature 
      searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and trial registers. Two reviewers 
      will independently select studies for inclusion and data extraction. ACT-CP-MA will 
      include randomized controlled trials with ACT for chronic pain compared to control 
      conditions for adults (≥ 18 years) with chronic pain (> 3 months). We will invite 
      the authors of all eligible trials to share individual participant data. Outcomes 
      will include standardized measures of pain interference, pain intensity, depression, 
      anxiety, health-related quality of life, participants' rating of overall 
      improvement, and ACT-related process variables. Using the Cochrane Collaboration's 
      tool and GRADE, reviewers will independently check for risk of bias, quality of 
      evidence, and strength of recommendations. In the individual participant data 
      meta-analysis, we will use a one-step approach where participants are clustered with 
      studies and data from all studies are modeled simultaneously. For analyses, we will 
      use mixed-effects models. Additionally, we will employ a meta-analysis with 
      aggregate data and compare the results of both meta-analyses. DISCUSSION: This 
      collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomized 
      controlled trials of ACT for chronic pain versus control conditions will demonstrate 
      how the known benefits of ACT for chronic pain vary across different subtypes of the 
      chronic pain population. The results of the meta-analyses will be based on a 
      comprehensive search of multiple databases and will help to inform future clinical 
      trials and decision-making on the use of ACT in chronic pain and improve the 
      quality, design, and reporting of future trials in this field. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the effect of MRA treatment (vs. placebo) in 
      older patients (≥75 years of age) compared with younger patients (<75 years of age) 
      with heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) 
      have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HF with reduced 
      ejection fraction (HFrEF) and in a subset of patients with HF with preserved EF 
      (HFpEF). Notwithstanding, MRAs are underused, especially in the elderly. Pooling the 
      individual patient data (IPD) provided more statistical power with which to assess 
      the efficacy and safety of MRA treatment in this subpopulation. METHODS: An IPD 
      meta-analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by 
      trial. A total of 1,756 patients (853 randomized to placebo and 903 to MRA) ≥75 
      years of age, along with 4,411 patients (2,242 randomized to placebo and 2,169 to 
      MRA) <75 years of age were included. The primary outcome was a composite of death 
      from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for HF. RESULTS: The treatment groups 
      were well balanced. Patients ≥75 years of age or older and those 80 years of age, 
      61% were male, 30% had diabetes, and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      59 ml/min. The primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (38.8%) in the placebo group 
      versus 281 (31.1%) in the MRA group (hazard ratio: 0.74; 95% confidence interval: 
      0.63 to 0.86; p < 0.001; and the heterogeneity p value [heterogeneity p = Cochran's 
      Q p value of treatment effect by study interaction] was 0.52). Cardiovascular death 
      and all-cause death were also reduced by MRAs without significant between-trial or 
      age (younger vs. older) heterogeneity. Worsening renal function and hyperkalemia 
      occurred more frequently in patients taking MRAs (vs. placebo). Compared to younger 
      patients, worsening renal function (but not hyperkalemia) was found more frequently 
      in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: MRAs reduced morbidity and mortality in elderly 
      patients with HF, a beneficial effect that is more marked in patients with HFrEF but 
      homogenous across HFrEF and HFpEF. Implementation of measures that increase MRA 
      treatment in this population are warranted.

LID - CD012621
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) comprises a group of complex and 
      heterogenous conditions, characterised by elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and 
      which left untreated leads to right-heart failure and death. PH includes World 
      Health Organisation (WHO) Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Group 2 
      consists of PH due to left-heart disease (PH-LHD); Group 3 comprises PH as a result 
      of lung diseases or hypoxia, or both; Group 4 includes PH due to chronic 
      thromboembolic occlusion of pulmonary vasculature (CTEPH), and Group 5 consists of 
      cases of PH due to unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms including 
      haematological, systemic, or metabolic disorders. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) 
      inhibitors increase vasodilation and inhibit proliferation. OBJECTIVES: To determine 
      the efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors for pulmonary hypertension in adults and children. 
      SEARCH METHODS: We performed searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web 
      of Science up to 26 September 2018. We handsearched review articles, clinical trial 
      registries, and reference lists of retrieved articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We 
      included randomised controlled trials that compared any PDE5 inhibitor versus 
      placebo, or any other PAH disease-specific therapies, for at least 12 weeks. We 
      include separate analyses for each PH group. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We 
      imported studies identified by the search into a reference manager database. We 
      retrieved the full-text versions of relevant studies, and two review authors 
      independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were: change in WHO functional class, 
      six-minute walk distance (6MWD), and mortality. Secondary outcomes were haemodynamic 
      parameters, quality of life/health status, dyspnoea, clinical worsening 
      (hospitalisation/intervention), and adverse events. When appropriate, we performed 
      meta-analyses and subgroup analyses by severity of lung function, connective tissue 
      disease diagnosis, and radiological pattern of fibrosis. We assessed the evidence 
      using the GRADE approach and created 'Summary of findings' tables. MAIN RESULTS: We 
      included 36 studies with 2999 participants (with pulmonary hypertension from all 
      causes) in the final review. Trials were conducted for 14 weeks on average, with 
      some as long as 12 months. Two trials specifically included children.Nineteen trials 
      included group 1 PAH participants. PAH participants treated with PDE5 inhibitors 
      were more likely to improve their WHO functional class (odds ratio (OR) 8.59, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 3.95 to 18.72; 4 trials, 282 participants), to walk 48 
      metres further in 6MWD (95% CI 40 to 56; 8 trials, 880 participants), and were 22% 
      less likely to die over a mean duration of 14 weeks (95% CI 0.07 to 0.68; 8 trials, 
      1119 participants) compared to placebo (high-certainty evidence). The number needed 
      to treat to prevent one additional death was 32 participants. There was an increased 
      risk of adverse events with PDE5 inhibitors, especially headache (OR 1.97, 95% CI 
      1.33 to 2.92; 5 trials, 848 participants), gastrointestinal upset (OR 1.63, 95% CI 
      1.07 to 2.48; 5 trials, 848 participants), flushing (OR 4.12, 95% CI 1.83 to 9.26; 3 
      trials, 748 participants), and muscle aches and joint pains (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.59 to 
      3.99; 4 trials, 792 participants).Data comparing PDE5 inhibitors to placebo whilst 
      on other PAH-specific therapy were limited by the small number of included trials. 
      Those PAH participants on PDE5 inhibitors plus combination therapy walked 19.66 
      metres further in six minutes (95% CI 9 to 30; 4 trials, 509 participants) compared 
      to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence). There were limited trials comparing PDE5 
      inhibitors directly with other PAH-specific therapy (endothelin receptor antagonists 
      (ERAs)). Those on PDE5 inhibitors walked 49 metres further than on ERAs (95% CI 4 to 
      95; 2 trials, 36 participants) (low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a 
      difference in WHO functional class or mortality across both treatments.Five trials 
      compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo in PH secondary to left-heart disease (PH-LHD). 
      The quality of data were low due to imprecision and inconsistency across trials. In 
      those with PH-LHD there were reduced odds of an improvement in WHO functional class 
      using PDE5 inhibitors compared to placebo (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87; 3 trials, 
      285 participants), and those using PDE5 inhibitors walked 34 metres further compared 
      to placebo (95% CI 23 to 46; 3 trials, 284 participants). There was no evidence of a 
      difference in mortality. Five trials compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo in PH 
      secondary to lung disease/hypoxia, mostly in COPD. Data were of low quality due to 
      imprecision of effect and inconsistency across trials. There was a small improvement 
      of 27 metres in 6MWD using PDE5 inhibitors compared to placebo in those with PH due 
      to lung disease. There was no evidence of worsening hypoxia using PDE5 inhibitors, 
      although data were limited. Three studies compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo or 
      other PAH-specific therapy in chronic thromboembolic disease. There was no 
      significant difference in any outcomes. Data quality was low due to imprecision of 
      effect and heterogeneity across trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: PDE5 inhibitors appear 
      to have clear beneficial effects in group 1 PAH. Sildenafil, tadalafil and 
      vardenafil are all efficacious in this clinical setting, and clinicians should 
      consider the side-effect profile for each individual when choosing which PDE5 
      inhibitor to prescribe.While there appears to be some benefit for the use of PDE5 
      inhibitors in PH-left-heart disease, it is not clear based on the mostly small, 
      short-term studies, which type of left-heart disease stands to benefit. These data 
      suggest possible harm in valvular heart disease. There is no clear benefit for PDE5 
      inhibitors in pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease or chronic 
      thromboembolic disease. Further research is required into the mechanisms of 
      pulmonary hypertension secondary to left-heart disease, and cautious consideration 
      of which subset of these patients may benefit from PDE5 inhibitors. Future trials in 
      PH-LHD should be sufficiently powered, with long-term follow-up, and should include 
      invasive haemodynamic data, WHO functional class, six-minute walk distance, and 
      clinical worsening.

TI  - Examination of Injury, Host, and Social-Environmental Moderators of Online Family 
      Problem Solving Treatment Efficacy for Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Using an 
      Individual Participant Data Meta-Analytic Approach.
PG  - 1147-1155
LID - 10.1089/neu.2018.5885 [doi]
AB  - A series of five randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) conducted between 2002 
      and 2015 support the potential efficacy of online family problem-solving treatment 
      (OFPST) in improving both child and parent/family outcomes after pediatric traumatic 
      brain injury (TBI). However, small sample sizes and heterogeneity across individual 
      studies have precluded examination of potentially important moderators. We jointly 
      analyzed individual participant data (IPD) from these five RCTs, involving 359 
      children and adolescents between the ages of 5 and 18 years, to confirm the role of 
      previously identified moderators (child's age and pre-treatment symptom levels, 
      parental education) and to examine other potential moderators (race, sex, IQ), using 
      IPD meta-analysis. This reanalysis revealed statistically strong evidence that 
      parental education, child age at baseline, IQ, sex, and parental depression level 
      pre-treatment moderated the effect of OFPST on various outcomes. In particular, 
      children of parents with a less than high school education exhibited fewer 
      internalizing problems and better social competence. Children injured at an older 
      age exhibited fewer externalizing behaviors and less executive dysfunction following 
      OFPST. Child IQ moderated the effect of OFPST on social competence, with 
      significantly better competence for children with lower IQ who received OFPST. Lower 
      levels of parental depression followed OFPST among subgroups with lower IQ, boys, 
      and higher parental depression scores at baseline. Our findings indicate that the 
      optimal application of OFPST is likely to involve older children, those with lower 
      IQ scores, or those from families with lower socioeconomic status (SES).

TI  - Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for perioperative monitoring of brain 
      oxygenation in children and adults.
PG  - CD010947
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010947.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD010947
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various techniques have been employed for the early detection of 
      perioperative cerebral ischaemia and hypoxia. Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy 
      (NIRS) is increasingly used in this clinical scenario to monitor brain oxygenation. 
      However, it is unknown whether perioperative cerebral NIRS monitoring and the 
      subsequent treatment strategies are of benefit to patients. OBJECTIVES: To assess 
      the effects of perioperative cerebral NIRS monitoring and corresponding treatment 
      strategies in adults and children, compared with blinded or no cerebral oxygenation 
      monitoring, or cerebral oxygenation monitoring based on non-NIRS technologies, on 
      the detection of cerebral oxygen desaturation events (CDEs), neurological outcomes, 
      non-neurological outcomes and socioeconomic impact (including cost of 
      hospitalization and length of hospital stay). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 12), Embase 
      (1974 to 20 December 2016) and MEDLINE (PubMed) (1975 to 20 December 2016). We also 
      searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry 
      Platform for ongoing studies on 20 December 2016. We updated this search in November 
      2017, but these results have not yet been incorporated in the review. We imposed no 
      language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all relevant randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) dealing with the use of cerebral NIRS in the perioperative 
      setting (during the operation and within 72 hours after the operation), including 
      the operating room, the postanaesthesia care unit and the intensive care unit. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk 
      of bias and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) 
      and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we estimated the mean 
      difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. As we expected clinical and 
      methodological heterogeneity between studies, we employed a random-effects model for 
      analyses and we examined the data for heterogeneity (I(2) statistic). We created a 
      'Summary of findings' table using GRADEpro. MAIN RESULTS: We included 15 studies in 
      the review, comprising a total of 1822 adult participants. There are 12 studies 
      awaiting classification, and eight ongoing studies.None of the 15 included studies 
      considered the paediatric population. Four studies were conducted in the abdominal 
      and orthopaedic surgery setting (lumbar spine, or knee and hip replacement), one 
      study in the carotid endarterectomy setting, and the remaining 10 studies in the 
      aortic or cardiac surgery setting. The main sources of bias in the included studies 
      related to potential conflict of interest from industry sponsorship, unclear 
      blinding status or missing participant data.Two studies with 312 participants 
      considered postoperative neurological injury, however no pooled effect estimate 
      could be calculated due to discordant direction of effect between studies 
      (low-quality evidence). One study (N = 126) in participants undergoing major 
      abdominal surgery reported that 4/66 participants experienced neurological injury 
      with blinded monitoring versus 0/56 in the active monitoring group. A second study 
      (N = 195) in participants having coronary artery bypass surgery reported that 1/96 
      participants experienced neurological injury in the blinded monitoring group 
      compared with 4/94 participants in the active monitoring group.We are uncertain 
      whether active cerebral NIRS monitoring has an important effect on the risk of 
      postoperative stroke because of the low number of events and wide confidence 
      interval (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.20; 2 studies, 240 participants; low-quality 
      evidence).We are uncertain whether active cerebral NIRS monitoring has an important 
      effect on postoperative delirium because of the wide confidence interval (RR 0.63, 
      95% CI 0.27 to 1.45; 1 study, 190 participants; low-quality evidence).Two studies 
      with 126 participants showed that active cerebral NIRS monitoring may reduce the 
      incidence of mild postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) as defined by the 
      original studies at one week after surgery (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.95, I(2) = 
      49%, low-quality evidence).Based on six studies with 962 participants, there was 
      moderate-quality evidence that active cerebral oxygenation monitoring probably does 
      not decrease the occurrence of POCD (decline in cognitive function) at one week 
      after surgery (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.04, I(2) = 80%). The different type of 
      monitoring equipment in one study could potentially be the cause of the 
      heterogeneity.We are uncertain whether active cerebral NIRS monitoring has an 
      important effect on intraoperative mortality or postoperative mortality because of 
      the low number of events and wide confidence interval (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.03, 
      I(2)= 0%; 3 studies, 390 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence 
      to determine whether routine use of NIRS-based cerebral oxygenation monitoring 
      causes adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effects of perioperative active 
      cerebral NIRS monitoring of brain oxygenation in adults for reducing the occurrence 
      of short-term, mild POCD are uncertain due to the low quality of the evidence. There 
      is uncertainty as to whether active cerebral NIRS monitoring has an important effect 
      on postoperative stroke, delirium or death because of the low number of events and 
      wide confidence intervals. The conclusions of this review may change when the eight 
      ongoing studies are published and the 12 studies awaiting assessment are classified. 
      More RCTs performed in the paediatric population and high-risk patients undergoing 
      non-cardiac surgery (e.g. neurosurgery, carotid endarterectomy and other surgery) 
      are needed.

TI  - Tramadol for neuropathic pain in adults.
PG  - CD003726
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD003726.pub4 [doi]
LID - CD003726
AB  - BACKGROUND: This review is an update of a review of tramadol for neuropathic pain, 
      published in 2006; updating was to bring the review in line with current standards. 
      Neuropathic pain, which is caused by a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory 
      system, may be central or peripheral in origin. Peripheral neuropathic pain often 
      includes symptoms such as burning or shooting sensations, abnormal sensitivity to 
      normally painless stimuli, or an increased sensitivity to normally painful stimuli. 
      Neuropathic pain is a common symptom in many diseases of the peripheral nervous 
      system. OBJECTIVES: To assess the analgesic efficacy of tramadol compared with 
      placebo or other active interventions for chronic neuropathic pain in adults, and 
      the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials. SEARCH METHODS: We 
      searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from 
      inception to January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies 
      and reviews, and online clinical trial registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included 
      randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing tramadol 
      (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for 
      neuropathic pain, with subjective pain assessment by the participant. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and 
      assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with 
      substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much 
      improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)), or moderate pain 
      relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on 
      PGIC). Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate 
      risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 
      (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH), using standard methods. We assessed the quality of 
      the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables. MAIN RESULTS: We 
      identified six randomised, double-blind studies involving 438 participants with 
      suitably characterised neuropathic pain. In each, tramadol was started at a dose of 
      about 100 mg daily and increased over one to two weeks to a maximum of 400 mg daily 
      or the maximum tolerated dose, and then maintained for the remainder of the study. 
      Participants had experienced moderate or severe neuropathic pain for at least three 
      months due to cancer, cancer treatment, postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral diabetic 
      neuropathy, spinal cord injury, or polyneuropathy. The mean age was 50 to 67 years 
      with approximately equal numbers of men and women. Exclusions were typically people 
      with other significant comorbidity or pain from other causes. Study duration for 
      treatments was four to six weeks, and two studies had a cross-over design.Not all 
      studies reported all the outcomes of interest, and there were limited data for pain 
      outcomes. At least 50% pain intensity reduction was reported in three studies (265 
      participants, 110 events). Using a random-effects analysis, 70/132 (53%) had at 
      least 50% pain relief with tramadol, and 40/133 (30%) with placebo; the risk ratio 
      (RR) was 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 4.6). The NNT calculated from 
      these data was 4.4 (95% CI 2.9 to 8.8). We downgraded the evidence for this outcome 
      by two levels to low quality because of the small size of studies and of the pooled 
      data set, because there were only 110 actual events, the analysis included different 
      types of neuropathic pain, the studies all had at least one high risk of potential 
      bias, and because of the limited duration of the studies.Participants experienced 
      more adverse events with tramadol than placebo. Report of any adverse event was 
      higher with tramadol (58%) than placebo (34%) (4 studies, 266 participants, 123 
      events; RR 1.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.1); NNH 4.2 (95% CI 2.8 to 8.3)). Adverse event 
      withdrawal was higher with tramadol (16%) than placebo (3%) (6 studies, 485 
      participants, 45 events; RR 4.1 (95% CI 2.0 to 8.4); NNH 8.2 (95% CI 5.8 to 14)). 
      Only four serious adverse events were reported, without obvious attribution to 
      treatment, and no deaths were reported. We downgraded the evidence for this outcome 
      by two or three levels to low or very low quality because of small study size, 
      because there were few actual events, and because of the limited duration of the 
      studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is only modest information about the use of 
      tramadol in neuropathic pain, coming from small, largely inadequate studies with 
      potential risk of bias. That bias would normally increase the apparent benefits of 
      tramadol. The evidence of benefit from tramadol was of low or very low quality, 
      meaning that it does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect, and the 
      likelihood is very high that the effect will be substantially different from the 
      estimate in this systematic review.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of Cerebrolysin in early post-stroke recovery: a meta-analysis 
      of nine randomized clinical trials.
PG  - 629-640
LID - 10.1007/s10072-017-3214-0 [doi]
AB  - This meta-analysis combines the results of nine ischemic stroke trials, assessing 
      efficacy of Cerebrolysin on global neurological improvement during early post-stroke 
      period. Cerebrolysin is a parenterally administered neuropeptide preparation 
      approved for treatment of stroke. All included studies had a prospective, 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The patients were treated with 
      30-50 ml Cerebrolysin once daily for 10-21 days, with treatment initiation within 
      72 h after onset of ischemic stroke. For five studies, original analysis data were 
      available for meta-analysis (individual patient data analysis); for four studies, 
      aggregate data were used. The combination by meta-analytic procedures was 
      pre-planned and the methods of synthesis were pre-defined under blinded conditions. 
      Search deadline for the present meta-analysis was December 31, 2016. The 
      nonparametric Mann-Whitney (MW) effect size for National Institutes of Health Stroke 
      Scale (NIHSS) on day 30 (or 21), combining the results of nine randomized, 
      controlled trials by means of the robust Wei-Lachin pooling procedure 
      (maximin-efficient robust test), indicated superiority of Cerebrolysin as compared 
      with placebo (MW 0.60, P < 0.0001, N = 1879). The combined number needed to treat 
      for clinically relevant changes in early NIHSS was 7.7 (95% CI 5.2 to 15.0). The 
      additional full-scale ordinal analysis of modified Rankin Scale at day 90 in 
      moderate to severe patients resulted in MW 0.61 with statistical significance in 
      favor of Cerebrolysin (95% CI 0.52 to 0.69, P = 0.0118, N = 314). Safety aspects 
      were comparable to placebo. Our meta-analysis confirms previous evidence that 
      Cerebrolysin has a beneficial effect on early global neurological deficits in 
      patients with acute ischemic stroke.

TI  - The concepts of evidence-based periodontal plastic surgery: Application of the 
      principles of evidence-based dentistry for the treatment of recession-type defects.
PG  - 81-106
LID - 10.1111/prd.12248 [doi]
AB  - The decision-making process for the treatment of recession-type defects is based on 
      translation of the outcomes from randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews 
      to clinical practice. Such an approach is capable of assisting researchers, 
      clinicians, and patients to understand the mechanisms and effects of the treatment 
      of different root-coverage procedures, as well as turning treatment options into 
      usable and predictable tools to be applied in dental practice. This review explores: 
      (a) the aspects related to the etiology of gingival recession; (b) the history of 
      periodontal plastic surgery procedures used to achieve root coverage; (c) the main 
      findings, implications of research, and practice of root-coverage procedures 
      described from the current base of systematic reviews; (d) the role of the evidence 
      produced in Latin American research centers; and (e) the outcomes of an individual 
      patient data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating the role of 
      root coverage and restorative procedures in achieving complete root coverage of 
      noncarious cervical lesions. The findings of the current base of evidence clearly 
      indicate that all of the main periodontal plastic surgery procedures lead to 
      improvements in initial clinical parameters, but subepithelial connective tissue 
      grafts, either alone or associated with coronally advanced flaps, result in superior 
      complete root coverage, long-term stability, and greater increase of keratinized 
      tissue. Nonetheless, coronally advanced flaps, either associated with biomaterials 
      (acellular dermal matrix grafts, enamel derivative proteins and xenogeneic collagen 
      matrix) or used alone, provide satisfactory results and are suitable for use as 
      secondary/alternative procedures to subepithelial connective tissue grafts.

TI  - Exercise Interventions in Huntington's Disease: An Individual Patient Data 
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 567-575
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.12809 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity may be beneficial in Huntington's disease (HD); 
      however, studies to date have been underpowered to detect change. We combined data 
      from five randomized controlled feasibility trials using individual patient data 
      meta-analyses. METHODS/DESIGN: All trial interventions comprised a combination of 
      supervised and self-directed physical activity, with varied emphasis on aerobic, 
      strength, endurance, flexibility, and task training. Duration ranged from 8 to 16 
      weeks. The primary outcome was the modified Unified Huntington's Disease Rating 
      Motor Score. Secondary outcomes included the Symbol Digit Modality Test, Berg 
      Balance Scale, 30-second Chair stand, Timed Up and Go, Gait Speed, Physical 
      Performance Test, Six-Minute Walk, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, EuroQol Health Utility Index, and Short-Form 
      36 Health Related Quality of Life Scale. The primary analysis utilized a two-stage 
      approach. A one-stage approach was explored as a sensitivity analysis using a 
      cross-classified (by study site) linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS: One hundred 
      twenty-one participants provided complete data. Risk of bias was moderate; however, 
      primary outcomes were blind assessed. Primary pooled effect estimates adjusted for 
      baseline modified motor score (95% confidence interval) were 0.2 (-2.1 to 2.6) 
      favoring control. There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of an exercise effect on the modified motor score 
      in these relatively short-duration interventions. Longer-duration trials 
      incorporating supervised components meeting frequency, intensity, time, and type 
      principles are required. Lack of common outcomes limited the analysis and highlight 
      the importance of a core outcome set for evaluating exercise in HD.

TI  - Delivery or expectant management for prevention of adverse maternal and neonatal 
      outcomes in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: an individual participant data 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 443-453
LID - 10.1002/uog.20224 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypertensive disorders affect 3-10% of pregnancies. Delayed delivery 
      carries maternal risks, while early delivery increases fetal risk, so appropriate 
      timing is important. The aim of this study was to compare immediate delivery with 
      expectant management for prevention of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in 
      women with hypertensive disease in pregnancy. METHODS: CENTRAL, PubMed, MEDLINE and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing 
      immediate delivery to expectant management in women presenting with gestational 
      hypertension or pre-eclampsia without severe features from 34 weeks of gestation. 
      The primary neonatal outcome was respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and the primary 
      maternal outcome was a composite of HELLP syndrome and eclampsia. The PRISMA-IPD 
      guideline was followed and a two-stage meta-analysis approach was used. Relative 
      risks (RR) and numbers needed to treat or harm (NNT/NNH) with 95% CI were calculated 
      to evaluate the effect of the intervention. RESULTS: Main outcomes were available 
      for 1724 eligible women. Compared with expectant management, immediate delivery 
      reduced the composite risk of HELLP syndrome and eclampsia in all women (0.8% vs 
      2.8%; RR, 0.33 (95% CI, 0.15-0.73); I(2)  = 0%; NNT, 51 (95% CI, 31.1-139.3)) as 
      well as in the pre-eclampsia subgroup (1.1% vs 3.5%; RR, 0.39 (95% CI, 0.15-0.98); 
      I(2)  = 0%). Immediate delivery increased RDS risk (3.4% vs 1.6%; RR, 1.94 (95% CI 
      1.05-3.6); I(2)  = 24%; NNH, 58 (95% CI, 31.1-363.1)), but depended upon gestational 
      age. Immediate delivery in the 35(th) week of gestation increased RDS risk (5.1% vs 
      0.6%; RR, 5.5 (95% CI, 1.0-29.6); I(2)  = 0%), but immediate delivery in the 36(th) 
      week did not (1.5% vs 0.4%; RR, 3.4 (95% CI, 0.4-30.3); I(2) not applicable). 
      CONCLUSION: In women with hypertension in pregnancy, immediate delivery reduces the 
      risk of maternal complications, whilst the effect on the neonate depends on 
      gestational age. Specifically, women with a-priori higher risk of progression to 
      HELLP, such as those already presenting with pre-eclampsia instead of gestational 
      hypertension, were shown to benefit from earlier delivery. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Plasma sRAGE is independently associated with increased mortality in ARDS: a 
      meta-analysis of individual patient data.
PG  - 1388-1399
LID - 10.1007/s00134-018-5327-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) is a 
      marker of lung epithelial injury and alveolar fluid clearance (AFC), with promising 
      values for assessing prognosis and lung injury severity in acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome (ARDS). Because AFC is impaired in most patients with ARDS and is 
      associated with higher mortality, we hypothesized that baseline plasma sRAGE would 
      predict mortality, independently of two key mediators of ventilator-induced lung 
      injury. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of individual data from 746 patients 
      enrolled in eight prospective randomized and observational studies in which plasma 
      sRAGE was measured in ARDS articles published through March 2016. The primary 
      outcome was 90-day mortality. Using multivariate and mediation analyses, we tested 
      the association between baseline plasma sRAGE and mortality, independently of 
      driving pressure and tidal volume. RESULTS: Higher baseline plasma sRAGE [odds ratio 
      (OR) for each one-log increment, 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.38; 
      P = 0.04], driving pressure (OR for each one-point increment, 1.04; 95% CI 
      1.02-1.07; P = 0.002), and tidal volume (OR for each one-log increment, 1.98; 95% CI 
      1.07-3.64; P = 0.03) were independently associated with higher 90-day mortality in 
      multivariate analysis. Baseline plasma sRAGE mediated a small fraction of the effect 
      of higher ΔP on mortality but not that of higher V(T). CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline 
      plasma sRAGE was associated with higher 90-day mortality in patients with ARDS, 
      independently of driving pressure and tidal volume, thus reinforcing the likely 
      contribution of alveolar epithelial injury as an important prognostic factor in 
      ARDS. Registration: PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018100241).

TI  - Changes in Dosing and Dose Timing of D-Cycloserine Explain Its Apparent Declining 
      Efficacy for Augmenting Exposure Therapy for Anxiety-related Disorders: An 
      Individual Participant-data Meta-analysis.

AB  - The apparent efficacy of d-cycloserine (DCS) for enhancing exposure treatment for 
      anxiety disorders appears to have declined over the past 14 years. We examined 
      whether variations in how DCS has been administered can account for this "declining 
      effect". We also investigated the association between DCS administration 
      characteristics and treatment outcome to find optimal dosing parameters. We 
      conducted a secondary analysis of individual participant data obtained from 1047 
      participants in 21 studies testing the efficacy of DCS-augmented exposure 
      treatments. Different outcome measures in different studies were harmonized to a 
      0-100 scale. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that, in participants randomized to DCS 
      augmentation (n = 523), fewer DCS doses, later timing of DCS dose, and lower 
      baseline severity appear to account for this decline effect. More DCS doses were 
      related to better outcomes, but this advantage leveled-off at nine doses. 
      Administering DCS more than 60 minutes before exposures was also related to better 
      outcomes. These predictors were not significant in the placebo arm (n = 521). 
      Results suggested that optimal DCS administration could increase pre-to-follow-up 
      DCS effect size by 50%. In conclusion, the apparent declining effectiveness of DCS 
      over time may be accounted for by how it has been administered. Optimal DCS 
      administration may substantially improve outcomes. Registration: The analysis plan

TI  - Association of Gleason Grade With Androgen Deprivation Therapy Duration and Survival 
      Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Patient-Level Meta-analysis.
PG  - 91-96
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.3732 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves survival outcomes in 
      patients with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) treated with radiotherapy (RT). 
      Whether this benefit differs between patients with Gleason grade group (GG) 4 
      (formerly Gleason score 8) and GG 5 (formerly Gleason score 9-10) disease remains 
      unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the effectiveness of ADT duration varies 
      between patients with GG 4 vs GG 5 PCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Traditional and network individual patient data meta-analyses of 992 patients (593 
      GG 4 and 399 GG 5) who were enrolled in 6 randomized clinical trials were carried 
      out. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were 
      used to obtain hazard ratio (HR) estimates of ADT duration effects on overall 
      survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Cause-specific competing 
      risk models were used to estimate HRs for cancer-specific survival (CSS). The 
      interaction of ADT with GS was incorporated into the multivariable models. 
      Traditional and network meta-analysis frameworks were used to compare outcomes of 
      patients treated with RT alone, short-term ADT (STADT), long-term ADT (LTADT), and 
      lifelong ADT. RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-three male patients (mean age, 70 years; 
      range, 43-88 years) with GG 4 and 399 with GG 5 were identified. Median follow-up 
      was 6.4 years. Among GG 4 patients, LTADT and STADT improved OS over RT alone (HR, 
      0.43; 95% CI, 0.26-0.70 and HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.93, respectively; P = .03 for 
      both), whereas lifelong ADT did not (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.54-1.30; P = .44). Among GG 
      5 patients, lifelong ADT improved OS (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.76; P = .04), whereas 
      neither LTADT nor STADT did (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.45-1.44 and HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 
      0.69-1.87; P = .45 and P = .64, respectively). Among all patients, and among those 
      receiving STADT, GG 5 patients had inferior OS compared with GG 4 patients (HR, 
      1.25; 95% CI, 1.07-1.47 and HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05-1.88, respectively; P = .02). 
      There was no significant OS difference between GG 5 and GG 4 patients receiving 
      LTADT or lifelong ADT (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.89-1.65 and HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.53-1.37; 
      P = .23 and P = .52, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data suggest 
      that prolonged durations of ADT improve survival outcomes in both GG 4 disease and 
      GG 5 disease, albeit with different optimal durations. Strategies to maintain the 
      efficacy of ADT while minimizing its duration (potentially with enhanced potency 
      agents) should be investigated.

TI  - Screening for Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Adults: Evidence Report and Systematic 
      Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.
PG  - 415-433
LID - 10.1001/jama.2016.19635 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Many adverse health outcomes are associated with obstructive sleep apnea 
      (OSA). OBJECTIVE: To review primary care-relevant evidence on screening adults for 
      OSA, test accuracy, and treatment of OSA, to inform the US Preventive Services Task 
      Force. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries through 
      October 2015, references, and experts, with surveillance of the literature through 
      October 5, 2016. STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized clinical trials 
      (RCTs); studies evaluating accuracy of screening questionnaires or prediction tools, 
      diagnostic accuracy of portable monitors, or association between apnea-hypopnea 
      index (AHI) and health outcomes among community-based participants. DATA EXTRACTION 
      AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text 
      articles. When multiple similar studies were available, random-effects meta-analyses 
      were conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, area under the 
      curve (AUC), AHI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, blood pressure, mortality, 
      cardiovascular events, motor vehicle crashes, quality of life, and harms. RESULTS: A 
      total of 110 studies were included (N = 46 188). No RCTs compared screening with no 
      screening. In 2 studies (n = 702), the screening accuracy of the multivariable apnea 
      prediction score followed by home portable monitor testing for detecting severe OSA 
      syndrome (AHI ≥30 and ESS score >10) was AUC 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.82) and 0.83 
      (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.90), respectively, but the studies oversampled high-risk 
      participants and those with OSA and OSA syndrome. No studies prospectively evaluated 
      screening tools to report calibration or clinical utility for improving health 
      outcomes. Meta-analysis found that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 
      compared with sham was significantly associated with reduction of AHI (weighted mean 
      difference [WMD], -33.8 [95% CI, -42.0 to -25.6]; 13 trials, 543 participants), 
      excessive sleepiness assessed by ESS score (WMD, -2.0 [95% CI, -2.6 to -1.4]; 22 
      trials, 2721 participants), diurnal systolic blood pressure (WMD, -2.4 points [95% 
      CI, -3.9 to -0.9]; 15 trials, 1190 participants), and diurnal diastolic blood 
      pressure (WMD, -1.3 points [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.4]; 15 trials, 1190 participants). 
      CPAP was associated with modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life (Cohen 
      d, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.42]; 13 trials, 2325 participants). Mandibular 
      advancement devices (MADs) and weight loss programs were also associated with 
      reduced AHI and excessive sleepiness. Common adverse effects of CPAP and MADs 
      included oral or nasal dryness, irritation, and pain, among others. In cohort 
      studies, there was a consistent association between AHI and all-cause mortality. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is uncertainty about the accuracy or clinical 
      utility of all potential screening tools. Multiple treatments for OSA reduce AHI, 
      ESS scores, and blood pressure. Trials of CPAP and other treatments have not 
      established whether treatment reduces mortality or improves most other health 
      outcomes, except for modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life.

TI  - Immediate versus deferred chemotherapy after radical cystectomy in patients with

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder have 
      poor survival after cystectomy. The EORTC 30994 trial aimed to compare immediate 
      versus deferred cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy after radical cystectomy in 
      patients with pT3-pT4 or N+ M0 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. METHODS: This 
      intergroup, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial recruited patients from hospitals 
      across Europe and Canada. Eligible patients had histologically proven urothelial 
      carcinoma of the bladder, pT3-pT4 disease or node positive (pN1-3) M0 disease after 
      radical cystectomy and bilateral lymphadenectomy, with no evidence of any 
      microscopic residual disease. Within 90 days of cystectomy, patients were centrally 
      randomly assigned (1:1) by minimisation to either immediate adjuvant chemotherapy 
      (four cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin, high-dose methotrexate, vinblastine, 
      doxorubicin, and cisplatin [high-dose MVAC], or MVAC) or six cycles of deferred 
      chemotherapy at relapse, with stratification for institution, pT category, and lymph 
      node status according to the number of nodes dissected. Neither patients nor 
      investigators were masked. Overall survival was the primary endpoint; all analyses 
      were by intention to treat. The trial was closed after recruitment of 284 of the 
      planned 660 patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
      NCT00028756. FINDINGS: From April 29, 2002, to Aug 14, 2008, 284 patients were 
      randomly assigned (141 to immediate treatment and 143 to deferred treatment), and 
      followed up until the data cutoff of Aug 21, 2013. After a median follow-up of 7.0 
      years (IQR 5.2-8.7), 66 (47%) of 141 patients in the immediate treatment group had 
      died compared with 82 (57%) of 143 in the deferred treatment group. No significant 
      improvement in overall survival was noted with immediate treatment when compared 
      with deferred treatment (adjusted HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.56-1.08; p=0.13). Immediate 
      treatment significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with deferred 
      treatment (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.4-0.73, p<0.0001), with 5-year progression-free 
      survival of 47.6% (95% CI 38.8-55.9) in the immediate treatment group and 31.8% 
      (24.2-39.6) in the deferred treatment group. Grade 3-4 myelosuppression was reported 
      in 33 (26%) of 128 patients who received treatment in the immediate chemotherapy 
      group versus 24 (35%) of 68 patients who received treatment in the deferred 
      chemotherapy group, neutropenia occurred in 49 (38%) versus 36 (53%) patients, 
      respectively, and thrombocytopenia in 36 (28%) versus 26 (38%). Two patients died 
      due to toxicity, one in each group. INTERPRETATION: Our data did not show a 
      significant improvement in overall survival with immediate versus deferred 
      chemotherapy after radical cystectomy and bilateral lymphadenectomy for patients 
      with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. However, the trial is limited in power, 
      and it is possible that some subgroups of patients might still benefit from 
      immediate chemotherapy. An updated individual patient data meta-analysis and 
      biomarker research are needed to further elucidate the potential for survival 
      benefit in subgroups of patients. FUNDING: Lilly, Canadian Cancer Society Research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of local failure (LF) after treatment of high-grade 
      prostate cancer (PCa) with definitive radiotherapy (RT) remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: 
      To evaluate the clinical implications of LF after definitive RT. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Individual patient data meta-analysis of 992 patients (593 Gleason 
      grade group [GG] 4 and 399 GG 5) enrolled in six randomized clinical trials. OUTCOME 
      MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models 
      were developed to evaluate the relationship between overall survival (OS), 
      PCa-specific survival (PCSS), and distant metastasis (DM)-free survival (DMFS) and 
      LF as a time-dependent covariate. Markov proportional hazard models were developed 
      to evaluate the impact of specific transitions between disease states on these 
      endpoints. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Median follow-up was 6.4 yr overall and 7.2 yr 
      for surviving patients. LF was significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR] 
      1.70 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.37-2.10]), PCSS (3.10 [95% CI 2.33-4.12]), and 
      DMFS (HR 1.92 [95% CI 1.54-2.39]), p < 0.001 for all). Patients who had not 
      transitioned to the LF state had a significantly lower hazard of transitioning to a 
      PCa-specific death state than those who transitioned to the LF state (HR 0.13 [95% 
      CI 0.04-0.41], p < 0.001). Additionally, patients who transitioned to the LF state 
      had a greater hazard of DM or death (HR 2.46 [95% CI 1.22-4.93], p = 0.01) than 
      those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: LF is an independent prognosticator of OS, PCSS, and 
      DMFS in high-grade localized PCa and a subset of DM events that are anteceded by LF 
      events. LF events warrant consideration for intervention, potentially suggesting a 
      rationale for upfront treatment intensification. However, whether these findings 
      apply to all men or just those without significant comorbidity remains to be 
      determined. PATIENT SUMMARY: Men who experience a local recurrence of high-grade 
      prostate cancer after receiving upfront radiation therapy are at significantly 
      increased risks of developing metastases and dying of prostate cancer.

TI  - Sleep-Associated Adverse Events During Methylphenidate Treatment of 
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Meta-Analysis.
LID - 18r12210 [pii]
LID - 10.4088/JCP.18r12210 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep disturbances are a feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD) and an adverse event (AE) of methylphenidate treatment. The authors 
      sought to clarify methylphenidate-associated sleep problems and how studies are 
      affected by confounding factors. DATA SOURCES: Published studies in English 
      collected via online databases and unpublished data from www.clinicaltrials.gov and 
      US Food and Drug Administration websites. Sources were searched from inception to 
      August 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Included were blinded placebo-controlled studies of 
      youth with ADHD conducted in naturalistic settings, leading to 35 studies yielding 
      75 observations of sleep-related AEs. These studies comprised 3,079 drug-exposed and 
      2,606 placebo-treated patients. DATA EXTRACTION: Two PhD-level reviewers reviewed 
      each study for inclusion. Four PhD/PharmD-level reviewers extracted data in 
      duplicate. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or, if needed, by the senior 
      author. RESULTS: Increased pooled relative risks (RRs) were found for 
      methylphenidate-associated sleep-related AEs for insomnia (general), initial 
      insomnia, middle insomnia, combined insomnia, and sleep disorder. Several sample or 
      study design features were significantly associated with the RR for sleep-related 
      AEs and the methylphenidate formulation studied (P < .05). After correction for 
      confounding variables, significant differences among drugs were found for initial 
      insomnia, insomnia (general), and sleep disorder (P < .0001) as the other categories 
      could not be tested due to insufficient studies. The findings also show that the RR 
      and its interpretation are constrained by the placebo AE rate. CONCLUSIONS: Several 
      types of insomnia and sleep problems are associated with methylphenidate treatment. 
      Study design and sample features influence the RR statistic. By showing that the 
      rate of placebo AEs impacts the RR, this study provides the field with a useful 
      covariate for adjusting RR statistics.

TI  - Effects of vitamin D supplementation on markers for cardiovascular disease and type 
      2 diabetes: an individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials.
PG  - 1043-1053
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqy078 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the causal role of 
      vitamin D on noncommunicable disease outcomes is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: The aim of 
      this study was to investigate whether there are beneficial or harmful effects of 
      cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) supplementation according to subgroups of remeasured 
      serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] on cardiovascular and glucometabolic surrogate 
      markers with the use of individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of RCTs. 
      DESIGN: Twelve RCTs (16 wk to 1 y of follow-up) were included. For standardization, 
      25(OH)D concentrations for all participants (n = 2994) at baseline and 
      postintervention were re-measured in bio-banked serum samples with the use of a 
      certified liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method traceable to a 
      reference measurement procedure. IPD meta-analyses were performed according to 
      subgroups of remeasured 25(OH)D. Main outcomes were blood pressure and glycated 
      hemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes were LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol and 
      triglycerides; parathyroid hormone (PTH); fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide; 
      and 2-h glucose. In secondary analyses, other potential effect modifiers were 
      studied. RESULTS: Remeasurement of 25(OH)D resulted in a lower mean 25(OH)D 
      concentration in 10 of 12 RCTs. Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the main 
      outcomes of blood pressure and HbA1c. Supplementation resulted in 10-20% lower PTH 
      concentrations, irrespective of the 25(OH)D subgroups. The subgroup analyses 
      according to achieved 25(OH)D concentrations showed a significant decrease in 
      LDL-cholesterol concentrations after vitamin D supplementation in 25(OH)D subgroups 
      with <75, <100, and <125 nmol of -0.10 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.20, -0.00 mmol/L), -0.10 
      mmol/L (95% CI: -0.18, -0.02 mmol/L), and -0.07 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.14, -0.00 
      mmol/L), respectively. Patient features that modified the treatment effect could not 
      be identified. CONCLUSIONS: For the main outcomes of blood pressure and HbA1c, the 
      data support no benefit for vitamin D supplementation. For the secondary outcomes, 
      in addition to its effect on PTH, we observed indications for a beneficial effect of 
      vitamin D supplementation only on LDL cholesterol, which warrants further 
      investigation. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02551835.

TI  - One-step validation method for surrogate endpoints using data from multiple 
      randomized cancer clinical trials with failure-time endpoints.
PG  - 2928-2942
LID - 10.1002/sim.8162 [doi]
AB  - A surrogate endpoint can be used instead of the most relevant clinical endpoint to 
      assess the efficiency of a new treatment. Before being used, a surrogate endpoint 
      must be validated based on appropriate methods. Numerous validation approaches have 
      been proposed with the most popular used in a context of meta-analysis, based on a 
      two-step analysis strategy. For two failure-time endpoints, two association 
      measurements are usually used, Kendall's τ at the individual level and the adjusted 
      coefficient of determination ( Rtrial,adj2 ) at the trial level. However, 
      Rtrial,adj2 is not always available due to model estimation constraints. We propose 
      a one-step validation approach based on a joint frailty model, including both 
      individual-level and trial-level random effects. Parameters have been estimated 
      using a semiparametric penalized marginal log-likelihood method, and various 
      numerical integration approaches were considered. Both individual- and trial-level 
      surrogacy were evaluated using a new definition of Kendall's τ and the coefficient 
      of determination. Estimators' performances were evaluated using simulation studies 
      and satisfactory results were found. The model was applied to individual patient 
      data meta-analyses in gastric cancer to assess disease-free survival as a surrogate 
      for overall survival, as part of the evaluation of adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Screening for Cervical Cancer With High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Testing: Updated 
      Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.
PG  - 687-705
LID - 10.1001/jama.2018.10400 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Cervical cancer can be prevented with detection and treatment of 
      precancerous cell changes caused primarily by high-risk types of human 
      papillomavirus (hrHPV), the causative agents in more than 90% of cervical cancers. 
      OBJECTIVE: To systematically review benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening 
      for hrHPV to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, 
      PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials from 
      January 2011 through February 15, 2017; surveillance through May 25, 2018. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing primary 
      hrHPV screening alone or hrHPV cotesting (both hrHPV testing and cytology) with 
      cytology (Papanicolaou [Pap] test) screening alone. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: 
      Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and 
      quality rated included studies; data were qualitatively synthesized. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Invasive cervical cancer; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN); 
      false-positive, colposcopy, and biopsy rates; psychological harms. RESULTS: Eight 
      RCTs (n = 410 556), 5 cohort studies (n = 402 615), and 1 individual participant 
      data (IPD) meta-analysis (n = 176 464) were included. Trials were heterogeneous for 
      screening interval, number of rounds, and protocol. For primary hrHPV screening, 
      evidence was consistent across 4 trials demonstrating increased detection of CIN 3 
      or worse (CIN 3+) in round 1 (relative risk [RR] range, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.09-2.37] to 
      7.46 [95% CI, 1.02-54.66]). Among 4 hrHPV cotesting trials, first-round CIN 3+ 
      detection was not significantly different between screening groups; RRs for 
      cumulative CIN 3+ detection over 2 screening rounds ranged from 0.91 to 1.13. In 
      first-round screening, false-positive rates for primary hrHPV screening ranged from 
      6.6% to 7.4%, compared with 2.6% to 6.5% for cytology. For cotesting, 
      false-positives ranged from 5.8% to 19.9% in the first round of screening, compared 
      with 2.6% to 10.9% for cytology. First-round colposcopy rates were also higher, 
      ranging 1.2% to 7.9% for primary hrHPV testing, compared with 1.1% to 3.1% for 
      cytology alone; colposcopy rates for cotesting ranged from 6.8% to 10.9%, compared 
      with 3.3% to 5.2% for cytology alone. The IPD meta-analysis of data from 4 cotesting 
      trials and 1 primary hrHPV screening trial found lower risk of invasive cervical 
      cancer with any hrHPV screening compared with cytology alone (pooled RR, 0.60 [95% 
      CI, 0.40-0.89]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Primary hrHPV screening detected higher 
      rates of CIN 3+ at first-round screening compared with cytology. Cotesting trials 
      did not show initial increased CIN 3+ detection. Both hrHPV screening strategies had 
      higher false-positive and colposcopy rates than cytology, which could lead to more 
      treatments with potential harms.

TI  - Prediction of pre-eclampsia: review of reviews.
PG  - 16-27
LID - 10.1002/uog.20117 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Primary studies and systematic reviews provide estimates of varying 
      accuracy for different factors in the prediction of pre-eclampsia. The aim of this 
      study was to review published systematic reviews to collate evidence on the ability 
      of available tests to predict pre-eclampsia, to identify high-value avenues for 
      future research and to minimize future research waste in this field. METHODS: 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library including DARE (Database of Abstracts of 
      Reviews of Effects) databases, from database inception to March 2017, and 
      bibliographies of relevant articles were searched, without language restrictions, 
      for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the prediction of pre-eclampsia. The 
      quality of the included reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR tool and a modified 
      version of the QUIPS tool. We evaluated the comprehensiveness of search, sample 
      size, tests and outcomes evaluated, data synthesis methods, predictive ability 
      estimates, risk of bias related to the population studied, measurement of predictors 
      and outcomes, study attrition and adjustment for confounding. RESULTS: From 2444 
      citations identified, 126 reviews were included, reporting on over 90 predictors and 
      52 prediction models for pre-eclampsia. Around a third (n = 37 (29.4%)) of all 
      reviews investigated solely biochemical markers for predicting pre-eclampsia, 31 
      (24.6%) investigated genetic associations with pre-eclampsia, 46 (36.5%) reported on 
      clinical characteristics, four (3.2%) evaluated only ultrasound markers and six 
      (4.8%) studied a combination of tests; two (1.6%) additional reviews evaluated 
      primary studies investigating any screening test for pre-eclampsia. Reviews included 
      between two and 265 primary studies, including up to 25 356 688 women in the largest 
      review. Only approximately half (n = 67 (53.2%)) of the reviews assessed the quality 
      of the included studies. There was a high risk of bias in many of the included 
      reviews, particularly in relation to population representativeness and study 
      attrition. Over 80% (n = 106 (84.1%)) summarized the findings using meta-analysis. 
      Thirty-two (25.4%) studies lacked a formal statement on funding. The predictors with 
      the best test performance were body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m(2) , with a 
      specificity of 92% (95% CI, 89-95%) and a sensitivity of 21% (95% CI, 12-31%); BMI 
      > 25 kg/m(2) , with a specificity of 73% (95% CI, 64-83%) and a sensitivity of 47% 
      (95% CI, 33-61%); first-trimester uterine artery pulsatility index or resistance 
      index > 90(th) centile (specificity 93% (95% CI, 90-96%) and sensitivity 26% (95% 
      CI, 23-31%)); placental growth factor (specificity 89% (95% CI, 89-89%) and 
      sensitivity 65% (95% CI, 63-67%)); and placental protein 13 (specificity 88% (95% 
      CI, 87-89%) and sensitivity 37% (95% CI, 33-41%)). No single marker had a test 
      performance suitable for routine clinical use. Models combining markers showed 
      promise, but none had undergone external validation. CONCLUSIONS: This review of 
      reviews calls into question the need for further aggregate meta-analysis in this 
      area given the large number of published reviews subject to the common limitations 
      of primary predictive studies. Prospective, well-designed studies of predictive 
      markers, preferably randomized intervention studies, and combined through 
      individual-patient data meta-analysis are needed to develop and validate new 
      prediction models to facilitate the prediction of pre-eclampsia and minimize further 
      research waste in this field. Copyright © 2018 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons

AB  - Observational studies address packed red blood cell effects at the end of shelf life 
      and have larger sample sizes compared to randomized control trials. Meta-analyses 
      combining data from observational studies have been complicated by differences in 
      aggregate transfused packed red blood cell age and outcome reporting. This study 
      abrogated these issues by taking a pooled patient data approach. Observational 
      studies reporting packed red blood cell age and clinical outcomes were identified 
      and patient-level data sets were sought from investigators. Odds ratios and 95% 
      confidence intervals for binary outcomes were calculated for each study, with mean 
      packed red blood cell age or maximum packed red blood cell age acting as independent 
      variables. The relationship between mean packed red blood cell age and hospital 
      length of stay for each paper was analyzed using zero-inflated Poisson regression. 
      Random effects models combined paper-level effect estimates. Extremes analyses were 
      completed by comparing patients transfused with mean packed red blood cell aged less 
      than ten days to those transfused with mean packed red blood cell aged at least 30 
      days. sixteen datasets were available for pooled patient data analysis. Mean packed 
      red blood cell age of at least 30 days was associated with an increased risk of 
      in-hospital mortality compared to mean packed red blood cell of less than ten days 
      (odds ratio: 3.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.27-8.29). Packed red blood cell age 
      was not correlated to increased risks of nosocomial infection or prolonged length of 
      hospital stay.

TI  - Real-time continuous glucose monitoring in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review and 
      individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 354-360
LID - 10.1111/cen.13290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RTCGM) may help in the 
      management of individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM); however, the 
      evidence supporting its use is unclear. The available meta-analyses on this topic 
      use aggregate data which weaken inference. OBJECTIVE: Individual patient data were 
      obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to conduct a meta-analysis and 
      synthesize evidence about the effect of RTCGM on glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), 
      hypoglycaemic events and time spent in hypoglycaemia in T1DM. METHODS: We searched 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of 
      Systematic Reviews, and Scopus through January 2015. We included RCTs that enrolled 
      individuals with T1DM and compared RTCGM vs control group. A two-step regression 
      model was used to pool individual patient data. RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs at 
      moderate risk of bias. Meta-analysis suggests that the use of RTCGM is associated 
      with a statistically significant but modest reduction in HbA1c (-0·276; 95% 
      confidence interval -0·465 to -0·087). The improvements in HbA1c were primarily seen 
      in individuals over age 15 years. We were unable to identify a statistically 
      significant difference in time spent in hypoglycaemia or the number of hypoglycaemic 
      episodes although these analyses were imprecise and warrant lower confidence. There 
      was no difference between males and females. CONCLUSION: RTCGM in T1DM is associated 
      with a reduction in HbA1c primarily in individuals over 15 years of age. We were 
      unable to identify a statistically significant difference in the time spent in 
      hypoglycaemia or the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes.

TI  - Early neonatal vitamin A supplementation and infant mortality: an individual 
      participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
PG  - 217-226
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2018-315242 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biannual vitamin A supplementation is a well-established survival tool 
      for preschool children 6 months and older in vitamin A deficient populations but 
      this schedule misses the opportunity to intervene on most young infant deaths. 
      Randomised trials of neonatal vitamin A supplementation (NVAS) in the first few days 
      of life to assess its impact on under 6-month mortality in low/middle-income 
      countries have had varying results. METHODS: Investigators of 11 published 
      randomised placebo-controlled NVAS trials (n=163 567 children) reanalysed their data 
      according to an agreed plan and pooled the primary outcomes of mortality from 
      supplementation through 6 and 12 months of age using random effects models and 
      meta-regression. One investigator withdrew but allowed use of the data. FINDINGS: 
      Overall there was no effect of NVAS on infant survival through 6 (risk ratio (RR) 
      0.97; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.06) or 12 months of age (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08) but 
      results varied by study population characteristics.NVAS significantly reduced 
      6-month mortality among the trials conducted in Southern Asia (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77 
      to 0.98), in contexts with moderate or severe vitamin A deficiency (defined as 10% 
      or higher proportion of women with serum retinol <0.7 µmol/L or 5% or more women 
      with night blindness) (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.94), early infant mortality was 30 
      or more per 1000 live births (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98), 75% or more of infant 
      mortality occurred in the first 6 months of life (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01), or 
      where >32% mothers had no schooling (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96). NVAS did not 
      reduce mortality in the first 6 months of life in trials conducted in Africa, in 
      contexts characterised by a low prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, lower rates of 
      infant mortality and where maternal education was more prevalent. There was a 
      suggestion of increased infant mortality in trials conducted in Africa (RR 1.07; 95% 
      CI 1.00 to 1.15).Individual-level characteristics such as sex, birth weight, 
      gestational age and size, age at dosing, parity, time of breast feeding initiation, 
      maternal education and maternal vitamin A supplementation did not modify the impact 
      of NVAS. CONCLUSION: NVAS reduced infant mortality in South Asia, in contexts where 
      the prevalence of maternal vitamin A deficiency is moderate to severe and early 
      infant mortality is high; but it had no beneficial effect on infant survival in 
      Africa, in contexts where the prevalence of maternal vitamin A deficiency is lower, 
      early infant mortality is low.

TI  - Drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents.
PG  - CD012436
LID - CD012436
AB  - BACKGROUND: Child and adolescent obesity has increased globally, and can be 
      associated with significant short- and long-term health consequences. OBJECTIVES: To 
      assess the efficacy of drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children 
      and adolescents. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed 
      (subsets not available on Ovid), LILACS as well as the trial registers ICTRP (WHO) 
      and ClinicalTrials.gov. Searches were undertaken from inception to March 2016. We 
      checked references and applied no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We 
      selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions for 
      treating obesity (licensed and unlicensed for this indication) in children and 
      adolescents (mean age under 18 years) with or without support of family members, 
      with a minimum of three months' pharmacological intervention and six months' 
      follow-up from baseline. We excluded interventions that specifically dealt with the 
      treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a 
      secondary or syndromic cause of obesity. In addition, we excluded trials which 
      included growth hormone therapies and pregnant participants. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data 
      following standard Cochrane methodology. Where necessary we contacted authors for 
      additional information. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 trials and identified eight 
      ongoing trials. The included trials evaluated metformin (11 trials), sibutramine 
      (six trials), orlistat (four trials), and one trial arm investigated the combination 
      of metformin and fluoxetine. The ongoing trials evaluated metformin (four trials), 
      topiramate (two trials) and exenatide (two trials). A total of 2484 people 
      participated in the included trials, 1478 participants were randomised to drug 
      intervention and 904 to comparator groups (91 participants took part in two 
      cross-over trials; 11 participants not specified). Eighteen trials used a placebo in 
      the comparator group. Two trials had a cross-over design while the remaining 19 
      trials were parallel RCTs. The length of the intervention period ranged from 12 
      weeks to 48 weeks, and the length of follow-up from baseline ranged from six months 
      to 100 weeks.Trials generally had a low risk of bias for random sequence generation, 
      allocation concealment and blinding (participants, personnel and assessors) for 
      subjective and objective outcomes. We judged approximately half of the trials as 
      having a high risk of bias in one or more domain such as selective reporting.The 
      primary outcomes of this review were change in body mass index (BMI), change in 
      weight and adverse events. All 21 trials measured these outcomes. The secondary 
      outcomes were health-related quality of life (only one trial reported results 
      showing no marked differences; very low certainty evidence), body fat distribution 
      (measured in 18 trials), behaviour change (measured in six trials), participants' 
      views of the intervention (not reported), morbidity associated with the intervention 
      (measured in one orlistat trial only reporting more new gallstones following the 
      intervention; very low certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (one suicide in the 
      orlistat intervention group; low certainty evidence) and socioeconomic effects (not 
      reported).Intervention versus comparator for mean difference (MD) in BMI change was 
      -1.3 kg/m(2) (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.9 to -0.8; P < 0.00001; 16 trials; 
      1884 participants; low certainty evidence). When split by drug type, sibutramine, 
      metformin and orlistat all showed reductions in BMI in favour of the 
      intervention.Intervention versus comparator for change in weight showed a MD of -3.9 
      kg (95% CI -5.9 to -1.9; P < 0.00001; 11 trials; 1180 participants; low certainty 
      evidence). As with BMI, when the trials were split by drug type, sibutramine, 
      metformin and orlistat all showed reductions in weight in favour of the 
      intervention.Five trials reported serious adverse events: 24/878 (2.7%) participants 
      in the intervention groups versus 8/469 (1.7%) participants in the comparator groups 
      (risk ratio (RR) 1.43, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.25; 1347 participants; low certainty 
      evidence). A total 52/1043 (5.0%) participants in the intervention groups versus 
      17/621 (2.7%) in the comparator groups discontinued the trial because of adverse 
      events (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.52; 10 trials; 1664 participants; low certainty 
      evidence). The most common adverse events in orlistat and metformin trials were 
      gastrointestinal (such as diarrhoea, mild abdominal pain or discomfort, fatty 
      stools). The most frequent adverse events in sibutramine trials included 
      tachycardia, constipation and hypertension. The single fluoxetine trial reported dry 
      mouth and loose stools. No trial investigated drug treatment for overweight 
      children. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review is part of a series of 
      associated Cochrane reviews on interventions for obese children and adolescents and 
      has shown that pharmacological interventions (metformin, sibutramine, orlistat and 
      fluoxetine) may have small effects in reduction in BMI and bodyweight in obese 
      children and adolescents. However, many of these drugs are not licensed for the 
      treatment of obesity in children and adolescents, or have been withdrawn. Trials 
      were generally of low quality with many having a short or no post-intervention 
      follow-up period and high dropout rates (overall dropout of 25%). Future research 
      should focus on conducting trials with sufficient power and long-term follow-up, to 
      ensure the long-term effects of any pharmacological intervention are comprehensively 
      assessed. Adverse events should be reported in a more standardised manner specifying 
      amongst other things the number of participants experiencing at least one adverse 
      event. The requirement of regulatory authorities (US Food and Drug Administration 
      and European Medicines Agency) for trials of all new medications to be used in 
      children and adolescents should drive an increase in the number of high quality 
      trials.

TI  - Nifedipine maintenance tocolysis and perinatal outcome: an individual participant 
      data meta-analysis.
PG  - 1753-60
LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.14249 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity 
      in developed countries. Whether continued tocolysis after 48 hours of rescue 
      tocolysis improves neonatal outcome is unproven. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the 
      effectiveness of maintenance tocolytic therapy with oral nifedipine on the reduction 
      of adverse neonatal outcomes and the prolongation of pregnancy by performing an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched PubMed, 
      Embase, and Cochrane databases for randomised controlled trials of maintenance 
      tocolysis therapy with nifedipine in preterm labour. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected 
      trials including pregnant women between 24 and 36(6/7)  weeks of gestation 
      (gestational age, GA) with imminent preterm labour who had not delivered after 
      48 hours of initial tocolysis, and compared maintenance nifedipine tocolysis with 
      placebo/no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was 
      perinatal mortality. Secondary outcome measures were intraventricular haemorrhage 
      (IVH), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), 
      prolongation of pregnancy, GA at delivery, birthweight, neonatal intensive care unit 
      admission, and number of days on ventilation support. Pre-specified subgroup 
      analyses were performed. MAIN RESULTS: Six randomised controlled trials were 
      included in this IPDMA, encompassing data from 787 patients (n = 390 for nifedipine; 
      n = 397 for placebo/no treatment). There was no difference between the groups for 
      the incidence of perinatal death (risk ratio, RR 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 
      95% CI 0.35-5.33), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) ≥ grade II (RR 0.65; 95% CI 
      0.16-2.67), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.50-2.65), infant 
      respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.51-1.85), and prolongation 
      of pregnancy (hazard ratio, HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.55-1.01). CONCLUSION: Maintenance 
      tocolysis is not associated with improved perinatal outcome and is therefore not 
      recommended for routine practice. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Nifedipine maintenance 
      tocolysis is not associated with improved perinatal outcome or pregnancy 
      prolongation.

TI  - Prognostic and Predictive Value of Microsatellite Instability, Inflammatory Reaction 
      and PD-L1 in Gastric Cancer Patients Treated with Either Adjuvant 5-FU/LV or 
      Sequential FOLFIRI Followed by Cisplatin and Docetaxel: A Translational Analysis 
      from the ITACA-S Trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with high microsatellite instability (MSI) gastric cancer (GC) 
      show improved survival and no benefit or harm from adjuvant and/or perioperative 
      chemotherapy. The role of immune microenvironment in GC is largely unknown. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, 256 tumor tissue blocks were centrally 
      collected from patients enrolled in ITACA-S, a randomized adjuvant trial of 5-FU/LV 
      versus sequential FOLFIRI and cisplatin-docetaxel. MSI status was assessed by 
      multiplex PCR, inflammatory reaction by H&E morphological assessment, and programmed 
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Overall, 9% 
      patients had MSI-high tumors, 23% had high inflammatory reaction, 11% had tumor 
      PD-L1 ≥ 1%, and 11% had stromal PD-L1 ≥ 1%. A significant association with 
      disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was found for MSI-high (hazard 
      ratio [HR], 0.43; p = .02; HR, 0.40; p = .02) and high inflammatory reaction (HR, 
      0.55; p = .010; HR, 0.53; p = .008) but not for PD-L1. At multivariable analysis, 
      only MSI showed an independent association with both DFS (p = .02) and OS (p = .01), 
      whereas inflammatory reaction showed an independent association only with OS (p = 
      .04). Patients with tumor PD-L1 ≥ 1% had a significantly longer DFS in sequential 
      chemotherapy than in than 5-FU/LV arm (interaction p = .04) and a trend for OS 
      (interaction p = .12). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that MSI status could be a 
      useful prognostic biomarker in patients with radically resected stage II-III GC and 
      should be used as stratification factor in future trials. Tumor PD-L1 ≥ 1% should be 
      further investigated as a potential predictor of benefit from intensive 
      chemotherapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In this post hoc analysis of patients with 
      radically resected gastric cancer randomized to an intensive sequential chemotherapy 
      regimen versus 5-FU/LV monotherapy as adjuvant treatment in the ITACA-S trial, 
      MSI-high status was independently associated with better disease-free survival and 
      overall survival (OS) and inflammatory reaction was independently associated with 
      better OS. Moreover, tumor PD-L1 expression ≥1% was associated with greater benefit 
      from intensive sequential chemotherapy compared with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin 
      (5-FU/LV), whereas PD-L1 expression <1% was not, conditioning a statistically 
      significant interaction between such biomarker and treatment arms. The meta-analysis 
      of individual patients' data from available studies could yield data on the role of 
      MSI status that could inform clinical decisions.

AB  - Ample evidence supports the use of Virtual Reality (VR) for anxiety disorders. 
      Nonetheless, currently there is no evidence about moderators or potential negative 
      effects of VR treatment strategies. An Individual Patient Data (IPD) approach was 
      employed with 15 retrieved datasets. The current study sample was composed of 810 
      patients. Randomized control trials (RCTs) for each primary outcome measure were 
      performed, in addition to moderator analyses of the socio-demographic variables. 
      Deterioration rates were 14 patients (4.0%) in VR, 8 (2.8%) in active control 
      conditions, and 27 (15%) in the WL condition. With regard to receiving treatment, 
      patients in a waiting list control condition had greater odds of deteriorating than 
      in the two active conditions, odds ratios (ORs) 4.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      [0.05, 0.67]. In the case of the socio-demographic variables, none of them were 
      associated with higher or lower odds of deterioration, with the exception of marital 
      status in the WL condition; married people presented a significantly lower 
      probability of deterioration, OR 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.67]. Finally, when comparing 
      pooled effects of VR versus all control conditions, the OR was 0.61 (95% CI 
      0.31-1.23) in favor of VR, although this result was not statistically significant. 
      This study provides evidence about the deterioration rates of a therapeutic VR 
      approach, showing that the number of deteriorated patients coincides with other 
      therapeutic approaches, and that deterioration is less likely to occur, compared to 
      patients in WL control groups.

AB  - A previous meta-analysis suggested that the treatment with erdosteine was associated 
      with significant amelioration of the cumulative global efficacy index and symptoms 
      in comparison to placebo or other mucolytics. However, this conclusion was 
      criticized because the meta-analysis, as it had been done, made it impossible to 
      preclude the potential operation of selection biases within and across trials, and 
      identify any realised benefits of an individual patient data approach. Taking into 
      consideration these criticisms and also the publication of two further recent 
      articles focused on the prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
      exacerbations with erdosteine, we have carried out a quantitative synthesis via 
      meta-analysis of the currently available data on the use of this drug. Our findings 
      included data from ten studies involving 1278 patients and show that erdosteine is 
      able to improve the clinical score of patients with chronic bronchitis and COPD, and 
      also reduces the overall risk of chronic bronchitis/COPD exacerbations, and reduces 
      the risk of experiencing at least one exacerbation. Furthermore, our data suggest 
      that erdosteine can lengthen the time to the first COPD exacerbation, reduce the 
      duration of a COPD exacerbation and the risk of hospitalization from COPD. The 
      documented effect of erdosteine in reducing the occurence and/or influencing COPD 
      exacerbations is important because it indicates that erdosteine can be added to the 
      list of drugs that can be recommended for treating COPD.

TI  - Effects and moderators of psychosocial interventions on quality of life, and 
      emotional and social function in patients with cancer: An individual patient data 
      meta-analysis of 22 RCTs.
PG  - 1150-1161
LID - 10.1002/pon.4648 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the 
      effects of psychosocial interventions (PSI) on quality of life (QoL), emotional 
      function (EF), and social function (SF) in patients with cancer, and to study 
      moderator effects of demographic, clinical, personal, and intervention-related 
      characteristics. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified via literature searches 
      in 4 databases. We pooled IPD from 22 (n = 4217) of 61 eligible randomized 
      controlled trials. Linear mixed-effect model analyses were used to study 
      intervention effects on the post-intervention values of QoL, EF, and SF (z-scores), 
      adjusting for baseline values, age, and cancer type. We studied moderator effects by 
      testing interactions with the intervention for demographic, clinical, personal, and 
      intervention-related characteristics, and conducted subsequent stratified analyses 
      for significant moderator variables. RESULTS: PSI significantly improved QoL 
      (β = 0.14,95%CI = 0.06;0.21), EF (β = 0.13,95%CI = 0.05;0.20), and SF 
      (β = 0.10,95%CI = 0.03;0.18). Significant differences in effects of different types 
      of PSI were found, with largest effects of psychotherapy. The effects of coping 
      skills training were moderated by age, treatment type, and targeted interventions. 
      Effects of psychotherapy on EF may be moderated by cancer type, but these analyses 
      were based on 2 randomized controlled trials with small sample sizes of some cancer 
      types. CONCLUSIONS: PSI significantly improved QoL, EF, and SF, with small overall 
      effects. However, the effects differed by several demographic, clinical, personal, 
      and intervention-related characteristics. Our study highlights the beneficial 
      effects of coping skills training in patients treated with chemotherapy, the 
      importance of targeted interventions, and the need of developing interventions 
      tailored to the specific needs of elderly patients.

TI  - Individual Patient Data Pooled Analysis of Randomized Trials of Bivalirudin versus 
      Heparin in Acute Myocardial Infarction: Rationale and Methodology.
PG  - 348-362
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-1700872 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND:  Individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of periprocedural 
      anticoagulation with bivalirudin versus heparin during percutaneous coronary 
      intervention (PCI) have reported conflicting results. Study-level meta-analyses lack 
      granularity to adjust for confounders, explore heterogeneity, or identify subgroups 
      that may particularly benefit or be harmed. OBJECTIVE:  To overcome these 
      limitations, we sought to develop an individual patient-data pooled database of RCTs 
      comparing bivalirudin versus heparin. METHODS:  We conducted a systematic review to 
      identify RCTs in which ≥1,000 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
      undergoing PCI were randomized to bivalirudin versus heparin. RESULTS:  From 738 
      identified studies, 8 RCTs met the prespecified criteria. The principal 
      investigators of each study agreed to provide patient-level data. The data were 
      pooled and checked for accuracy against trial publications, with discrepancies 
      addressed by consulting with the trialists. Consensus-based definitions were created 
      to resolve differing antithrombotic, procedural, and outcome definitions. The 
      project required 3.5 years to complete, and the final database includes 27,409 
      patients (13,346 randomized to bivalirudin and 14,063 randomized to heparin). 
      CONCLUSION:  We have created a large individual patient database of bivalirudin 
      versus heparin RCTs in patients with AMI undergoing PCI. This endeavor may help 
      identify the optimal periprocedural anticoagulation regimen for patient groups with 
      different relative risks of adverse ischemic versus bleeding events, including those 
      with ST-segment and non-ST-segment elevation MI, radial versus femoral access, use 
      of a prolonged bivalirudin infusion or glycoprotein inhibitors, and others. 
      Adherence to standardized techniques and rigorous validation processes should 
      increase confidence in the accuracy and robustness of the results.

      randomised trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early thrombus removal might prevent post-thrombotic syndrome by 
      preserving venous function and restoring flow. Previous trials comparing additional 
      catheter-directed thrombolysis to standard treatment showed conflicting outcomes. We 
      aimed to assess the benefit of additional ultrasound-accelerated catheter-directed 
      thrombolysis for the prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome compared with standard 
      therapy in patients with iliofemoral deep-vein thrombosis. METHODS: We did a 
      multicentre, randomised, single-blind, allocation-concealed, parallel group, 
      superiority trial in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients aged 18-85 years with 
      a first-time acute iliofemoral deep-vein thrombosis and symptoms for no more than 14 
      days were randomly assigned (1:1) to either standard treatment with additional 
      ultrasound-accelerated catheter-directed thrombolysis or standard treatment alone. 
      Randomisation was done with a web-based automatic programme and a random varying 
      block size (2-12), stratified by age and centre. Standard treatment included 
      anticoagulant therapy, compression therapy (knee-high elastic compression stockings; 
      30-40 mmHg), and early ambulation. Additional ultrasound-accelerated 
      catheter-directed thrombolysis was done with urokinase with a starting bolus of 
      250 000 international units (IU) in 10 mL NaCl followed by a continuous dose of 
      100 000 IU/h for a maximum of 96 h through the Ekos Endowave-system. Adjunctive 
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, thrombosuction, or stenting was performed at 
      the discretion of the physician who performed the intervention. The primary outcome 
      was the proportion of patients with post-thrombotic syndrome at 12 months diagnosed 
      according to the original Villalta criteria-a Villalta-score of at least 5 on two 
      consecutive occasions at least 3 months apart or the occurrence of venous 
      ulceration-and was assessed in a modified intention-to-treat population of all 
      randomly assigned patients who passed screening and started treatment. The safety 
      analysis was assessed in the same modified intention-to-treat population. This study 
      is complete and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00970619. FINDINGS: Between 
      May 28, 2010, and Sept 18, 2017, 184 patients were randomly assigned to either 
      additional ultrasound-accelerated catheter-directed thrombolysis (n=91) or standard 
      treatment alone (n=93). Exclusion because of screening failure or early withdrawal 
      of informed consent resulted in 77 patients in the intervention group and 75 in the 
      standard treatment group starting allocated treatment. Median follow-up was 12·0 
      months (IQR 6·0-12·0). 12-month post-thrombotic syndrome occurred in 22 (29%) 
      patients allocated to additional treatment versus 26 (35%) patients receiving 
      standard treatment alone (odds ratio 0·75 [95% CI 0·38 to 1·50]; p=0·42). Major 
      bleeding occurred in four (5%) patients in the intervention group, with associated 
      neuropraxia or the peroneal nerve in one patient, and no events in the standard 
      treatment group. No serious adverse events occurred. None of the four deaths (one 
      [1%] in the intervention group vs three [4%] in the standard treatment group) were 
      treatment related. INTERPRETATION: This study showed that additional 
      ultrasound-accelerated catheter-directed thrombolysis does not change the risk of 
      post-thrombotic syndrome 1 year after acute iliofemoral deep-vein thrombosis 
      compared with standard therapy alone. Although this trial is inconclusive, the 
      outcome suggests the possibility of a moderate beneficial effect with additional 
      ultrasound-accelerated catheter-directed thrombolysis. Further research is therefore 
      warranted to better understand this outcome in the context of previous trials, 
      preferably by combining the available evidence in an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis. FUNDING: The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Low Frequency Whole-Body Electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) to 
      Improve Health-Related Outcomes in Non-athletic Adults. A Systematic Review.

AB  - Exercise positively affects most risk factors, diseases and disabling conditions of 
      middle to advanced age, however the majority of middle-aged to older people fall 
      short of the exercise doses recommended for positively affecting cardio-metabolic, 
      musculoskeletal and neurophysiological fitness or disabling conditions. Whole-Body 
      Electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) may be a promising exercise technology for people 
      unable or unmotivated to exercise conventionally. However, until recently there has 
      been a dearth of evidence with respect to WB-EMS-induced effects on health-related 
      outcomes. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the effects, limitations 
      and risks of WB-EMS as a preventive or therapeutic tool for non-athletic adults. 
      Electronic searches in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Eric 
      were run to identify randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, 
      meta-analyses of individual patient data and peer reviewed scientific theses that 
      examined (1) WB-EMS-induced changes of musculoskeletal risk factors and diseases (2) 
      WB-EMS-induced changes of functional capacity and physical fitness (3) 
      WB-EMS-induced changes of cardio-metabolic risk factors and diseases (4) Risk 
      factors of WB-EMS application and adverse effects during WB-EMS interventions. Two 
      researchers independently reviewed articles for eligibility and methodological 
      quality. Twenty-three eligible research articles generated by fourteen research 
      projects were finally included. In summary, thirteen projects were WB-EMS trials and 
      one study was a meta-analysis of individual patient data. WB-EMS significantly 
      improves muscle mass and function while reducing fat mass and low back pain. 
      Although there is some evidence of a positive effect of WB-EMS on cardio-metabolic 
      risk factors, this aspect requires further detailed study. Properly applied and 
      supervised, WB-EMS appears to be a safe training technology. In summary, WB-EMS 
      represents a safe and reasonable option for cohorts unable or unwilling to join 
      conventional exercise programs. However, much like all other types of exercise, 
      WB-EMS does not affect every aspect of physical performance and health.

TI  - Considering benefits and harms of duloxetine for treatment of stress urinary 
      incontinence: a meta-analysis of clinical study reports.
PG  - E194-E203
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.151104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The European Medicines Agency makes clinical study reports publicly 
      available and publishes reasons for not approving applications for marketing 
      authorization. Duloxetine has been approved in Europe for the treatment of stress 
      urinary incontinence in women. The reported adverse effects of duloxetine include 
      mental health problems and suicidality. We obtained clinical study reports from the 
      European Medicines Agency concerning use of this drug for stress urinary 
      incontinence. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 4 randomized 
      placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine (involving a total of 1913 patients) 
      submitted to the European Medicines Agency for marketing approval for the indication 
      of stress urinary incontinence in women. We used data from the clinical study 
      reports (totalling 6870 pages and including individual patient data) to assess 
      benefits (including frequency of incontinence and changes in quality-of-life scores, 
      such as Patient Global Impression of Improvement rating) and harms (both general 
      harms, including discontinuation because of adverse events, and harms related to 
      suicidality, violent behaviour and their potential precursors, such as akathisia and 
      activation [stimulating effects such as insomnia, anxiety and agitation]). RESULTS: 
      Duloxetine was significantly better than placebo in terms of percentage change in 
      weekly incontinence episodes (mean difference -13.56%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      -21.59% to -5.53%) and change in Incontinence Quality of Life total score (mean 
      difference 3.24, 95% CI 2.00 to 4.48). However, the effect sizes were small, and a 
      sensitivity analysis (with removal of one trial) showed that the number needed to 
      treat for a Patient Global Impression of Improvement rating of "much better or very 
      much better" was 8 (95% CI 6 to 13). The numbers needed to harm were 7 (95% CI 6 to 
      8) for discontinuing because of an adverse event and 7 (95% CI 6 to 9) for 
      experiencing an activation event. No suicidality, violence or akathisia events were 
      noted. INTERPRETATION: Although duloxetine is effective for stress urinary 
      incontinence in women, the rates of associated harm were high when individual 
      patient data were analyzed, and the harms outweighed the benefits.

TI  - Outcome of children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma: A meta-analysis of 
      ITCC/SIOPEN European phase II clinical trials.
PG  - 25-31
LID - 10.1002/pbc.26192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few randomized trials have been conducted in children with 
      relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma and data about outcomes including progression-free 
      survival (PFS) in these patients are scarce. PROCEDURE: A meta-analysis of three 
      phase II studies of children with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma conducted in 
      Europe (temozolomide, topotecan-vincristine-doxorubicin and topotecan-temozolomide) 
      was performed. Individual patient data with extended follow-up were collected from 
      the trial databases after publication to describe trial outcomes (response rate, 
      clinical benefit ratio, duration of treatment, PFS, and overall survival [OS]). 
      Characteristics of subjects with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma were compared. 
      RESULTS: Data from 71 children and adolescents with relapsed/refractory 
      neuroblastoma were collected. Response definitions were not homogeneous in the three 
      trials. Patients were on study for a median of 3.5 months (interquartile range [IQR] 
      1.9-6.2). Of those, 35.2% achieved a complete or partial response, 26.3% experienced 
      a response after more than two cycles, and 23.9% received more than six cycles. 
      Median PFS from study entry for all, refractory, and relapsed patients was 6.4 ± 
      1.0, 12.5 ± 6.8, and 5.7 ± 1.0 months, respectively (P = 0.006). Median OS from 
      study entry for all, refractory, and relapsed patients was 16.1 ± 4.3, 27.9 ± 20.2, 
      and 11.0 ± 1.6 months, respectively (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline data for 
      response rate, clinical benefit ratio, duration of treatment, PFS, and OS were 
      provided. Two subpopulations (relapsed/refractory) were clearly distinct and should 
      be included in the interpretation of all trials. These results should help informing 
      the design of forthcoming studies in relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.

TI  - Effects of restrictive red blood cell transfusion on the prognoses of adult patients

AB  - PURPOSE: Restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategies remain controversial in 
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the 
      prognostic benefits of restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategies in patients 
      undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: We identified randomized clinical trials 
      through the 9th of December 2017 that investigated a restrictive red blood cell 
      transfusion strategy versus a liberal transfusion strategy in patients undergoing 
      cardiac surgery. Individual patient data from each study were collected. 
      Meta-analyses were performed for the primary and secondary outcomes. The risk of 
      bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. A trial sequential analysis 
      (TSA)-adjusted random-effects model was used to pool the results from the included 
      studies for the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Seven trials involving a total of 8886 
      patients were included. The TSA evaluations suggested that this meta-analysis could 
      draw firm negative results, and the data were sufficient. There was no evidence that 
      the risk of 30-day mortality differed between the patients assigned to a restrictive 
      blood cell transfusion strategy and a liberal transfusion strategy (odds ratio (OR) 
      0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.24; p = 0.87). Furthermore, the study 
      suggested that the restrictive transfusion strategy was not associated with 
      significant increases in pulmonary morbidity (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.34; 
      p = 0.44), postoperative infection (OR 1.11; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.3; p = 0.58), acute 
      kidney injury (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.14; p = 0.71), acute myocardial infarction 
      (OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.27; p = 0.78), or cerebrovascular accidents (OR 0.97; 95% 
      CI 0.72 to 1.30; p = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that the 
      restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy was not inferior to the liberal 
      strategy with respect to 30-day mortality, pulmonary morbidity, postoperative 
      infection, cerebrovascular accidents, acute kidney injury, or acute myocardial 
      infarction, and fewer red blood cells were transfused.

AB  - Through their profound effects on the bone microenvironment, bone targeted 
      treatments can potentially modify the process of metastasis and have important 
      effects on disease outcomes as well as on bone health. The Early Breast Cancer 
      Trialists Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) evaluated the effect of adjuvant 
      bisphosphonates in early breast cancer by performing a meta-analysis of individual 
      patient data (n = 18,766) from all available randomized trials initiated between the 
      early 1990s until 2006. In postmenopausal women, bisphosphonates reduced bone 
      recurrence (RR = 0.72; 95%CI 0.60-0.86, 2p = 0.0002) and breast cancer mortality 
      (0.82; 95%CI 0.73-0.93, 2p = 0.002); no effects on disease outcomes could be 
      identified in premenopausal women. Somewhat surprisingly, these effects could not be 
      reproduced in the large adjuvant trial of denosumab (DCARE). In this study, neither 
      bone metastasis free survival (the primary endpoint) or disease-free survival were 
      improved by the addition of this targeted antibody inhibitor of osteoclast activity. 
      Efforts are ongoing to try to understand the biologic implications of these results. 
      For now, the use of denosumab in early cancers is limited to its use for fracture 
      prevention using the 60mg every 6 months dosing schedule.

TI  - Do guided internet-based interventions result in clinically relevant changes for 
      patients with depression? An individual participant data meta-analysis.

AB  - Little is known about clinically relevant changes in guided Internet-based 
      interventions for depression. Moreover, methodological and power limitations 
      preclude the identification of patients' groups that may benefit more from these 
      interventions. This study aimed to investigate response rates, remission rates, and 
      their moderators in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of 
      guided Internet-based interventions for adult depression to control groups using an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis approach. Literature searches in PubMed, 
      Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library resulted in 13,384 abstracts from database 
      inception to January 1, 2016. Twenty-four RCTs (4889 participants) comparing a 
      guided Internet-based intervention with a control group contributed data to the 
      analysis. Missing data were multiply imputed. To examine treatment outcome on 
      response and remission, mixed-effects models with participants nested within studies 
      were used. Response and remission rates were calculated using the Reliable Change 
      Index. The intervention group obtained significantly higher response rates 
      (OR = 2.49, 95% CI 2.17-2.85) and remission rates compared to controls (OR = 2.41, 
      95% CI 2.07-2.79). The moderator analysis indicated that older participants 
      (OR = 1.01) and native-born participants (1.66) were more likely to respond to 
      treatment compared to younger participants and ethnic minorities respectively. Age 
      (OR = 1.01) and ethnicity (1.73) also moderated the effects of treatment on 
      remission.Moreover, adults with more severe depressive symptoms at baseline were 
      more likely to remit after receiving internet-based treatment (OR = 1.19). Guided 
      Internet-based interventions lead to substantial positive treatment effects on 
      treatment response and remission at post-treatment. Thus, such interventions may 
      complement existing services for depression and potentially reduce the gap between 
      the need and provision of evidence-based treatments.

TI  - Standardized Measurement of Sensorimotor Recovery in Stroke Trials: Consensus-Based 
      Core Recommendations from the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable.
PG  - 784-792
LID - 10.1177/1545968317732662 [doi]
AB  - Finding, testing and demonstrating efficacy of new treatments for stroke recovery is 
      a multifaceted challenge. We believe that to advance the field, neurorehabilitation 
      trials need a conceptually rigorous starting framework. An essential first step is 
      to agree on definitions of sensorimotor recovery and on measures consistent with 
      these definitions. Such standardization would allow pooling of participant data 
      across studies and institutions aiding meta-analyses of completed trials, more 
      detailed exploration of recovery profiles of our patients and the generation of new 
      hypotheses. Here, we present the results of a consensus meeting about measurement 
      standards and patient characteristics that we suggest should be collected in all 
      future stroke recovery trials. Recommendations are made considering time post stroke 
      and are aligned with the international classification of functioning and disability. 
      A strong case is made for addition of kinematic and kinetic movement quantification. 
      Further work is being undertaken by our group to form consensus on clinical 
      predictors and pre-stroke clinical data that should be collected, as well as 
      recommendations for additional outcome measurement tools. To improve stroke recovery 
      trials, we urge the research community to consider adopting our recommendations in 
      their trial design.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of chemotherapy added to a surgical locoregional 
      treatment (LRT) for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell 
      carcinoma (HNSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the sub-group of trials with 
      surgical LRT included in the meta-analysis on chemotherapy in head and neck cancer 
      (MACH-NC). Data from published and unpublished randomized trials comparing the 
      addition of chemotherapy to LRT in HNSCC patients were sought using electronic 
      database searching for the period 1965-2000, hand searching and by contacting 
      experts in the field. Trials with less than 60 patients, or preoperative 
      radiotherapy or where the type of LRT could not be individually determined were 
      excluded. All individual patient data were checked for internal consistency, 
      compared with published reports, and validated with trialists. Data were pooled 
      using a fixed-effect model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane test and I(2) 
      statistic. RESULTS: Twenty-four trials were eligible (5000 patients). Chemotherapy 
      improved overall survival (HR = 0.92 [95%CI: 0.85-0.99] p = 0.02). There was a 
      significant interaction between treatment effect and timing of chemotherapy 
      (p = 0.08 at pre-specified threshold of 0.10) with a greater effect for concomitant 
      chemotherapy (HR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.69-0.92). The benefit of chemotherapy was greater 
      in women (HR(women) = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.50-0.80) compared to men (HR(men) = 0.96, 
      95%CI: 0.89-1.04; p for interaction = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis confirmed 
      the benefit of concomitant chemotherapy added to surgical LRT. The role of induction 
      therapy as yet to be determined as it did not improve OS. Women may benefit more 
      than men from chemotherapy.

TI  - The Effect of Patient Characteristics on Acupuncture Treatment Outcomes: An 
      Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis of 20,827 Chronic Pain Patients in Randomized 
      Controlled Trials.
PG  - 428-434
LID - 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000691 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To optimally select chronic pain patients for different treatments, as 
      it is of interest to identify patient characteristics that might moderate treatment 
      effect. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of possible moderators on the effect of 
      acupuncture treatment using a large data set. METHODS: We used data from an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis of high-quality randomized trials of 
      acupuncture for chronic headache and migraine, osteoarthritis, and back, neck, and 
      shoulder pain. Using meta-analytic trial-level and patient-level regression 
      analyses, we explored the impact of 5 documented patient characteristics (patients' 
      age at baseline, sex, pain duration, baseline pain severity and baseline 
      psychological distress) on the effect of acupuncture. RESULTS: A total of 39 trials 
      met the inclusion criteria: 25 use sham-acupuncture controls (n = 7097) and 25 
      non-acupuncture controls (n = 16,041). Of the 5 patient characteristics analyzed, 
      only baseline pain severity was found to potentially moderate the treatment effect 
      of acupuncture, with patients reporting more severe pain at baseline experiencing 
      more benefit from acupuncture compared to either sham-control or non-acupuncture 
      control. Baseline psychological distress showed small treatment moderating effects, 
      and results for sex were inconsistent. There was no strong evidence that age or 
      duration of pain influenced the response to acupuncture. DISCUSSION: Of 5 patient 
      characteristics tested, we found only baseline severity of pain to potentially 
      moderate the effect of acupuncture treatment. For clinical practice, the evidence 
      from this analysis does not justify stratifying chronic pain patients into subgroups 
      that should or should not receive acupuncture on the basis of these 5 
      characteristics. Future acupuncture trials should assess other potentially important 
      effect moderators.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Nonresponse can bias prevalence estimates in population surveys. Effects 
      of selective participation in behavior change intervention trials have been little 
      studied. We tested hypotheses that trial participants who are hard to recruit are 
      (1) more likely to be lost-to-follow-up and (2) less responsive to intervention. 
      STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We undertook a two-stage individual participant data 
      meta-analysis of four alcohol intervention trials involving 9,251 university 
      students in Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden, comparing participants who enrolled 
      "late" (after the final invitation to participate) vs. "early" (before that). 
      Outcomes were whether participants completed assessments at each trial's primary 
      endpoint (late/early) and number of drinks consumed per week (intervention/control) 
      among late enrolees vs. early enrolees. RESULTS: Late enrolees were more likely to 
      be lost-to-follow-up than early enrolees (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.7, 2.9). Intervention 
      effect estimates were smaller for late vs. early enrolees, but not significantly so 
      (RR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.08). CONCLUSION: Greater effort to recruit trial 
      participants was associated with higher attrition, but there was no clear evidence 
      of bias in effect estimation. The possibility that intervention effect estimates do 
      not generalize beyond a relatively compliant minority of trial participants may 
      warrant further study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Procedural characteristics, including stent design, may influence the 
      outcome of carotid artery stenting (CAS). A thorough comparison of the effect of 
      stent design on outcome of CAS is thus warranted to allow for optimal evidence-based 
      clinical decision making. This study sought to evaluate the effect of stent design 
      on clinical and radiologic outcomes of CAS. METHODS: A systematic search was 
      conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases in May 2018. Included were 
      articles reporting on the occurrence of clinical short- and intermediate-term major 
      adverse events (MAEs; any stroke or death) or radiologic adverse events (new 
      ischemic lesions on postprocedural magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging 
      [MR-DWI], restenosis, or stent fracture) in different stent designs used to treat 
      carotid artery stenosis. Random effects models were used to calculate combined 
      overall effect sizes. Metaregression was performed to identify the effect of 
      specific stents on MAE rates. RESULTS: From 2654 unique identified articles, two 
      randomized, controlled trials and 66 cohort studies were eligible for analysis 
      (including 46,728 procedures). Short-term clinical MAE rates were similar for 
      patients treated with open cell vs closed cell or hybrid stents. Use of an Acculink 
      stent was associated with a higher risk of short-term MAE compared with a Wallstent 
      (risk ratio [RR], 1.51; P = .03), as was true for use of Precise stent vs Xact stent 
      (RR, 1.55; P < .001). Intermediate-term clinical MAE rates were similar for open vs 
      closed cell stents. Use of open cell stents predisposed to a 25% higher chance (RR, 
      1.25; P = .03) of developing postprocedural new ischemic lesions on MR-DWI. No 
      differences were observed in the incidence of restenosis, stent fracture, or 
      intraprocedural hemodynamic depression with respect to different stent design. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Stent design is not associated with short- or intermediate-term 
      clinical MAE rates in patients undergoing CAS. Furthermore, the division in open and 
      closed cell stent design might conceal true differences in single stent efficacy. 
      Nevertheless, open cell stenting resulted in a significantly higher number of 
      subclinical postprocedural new ischemic lesions detected on MR-DWI compared with 
      closed cell stenting. An individualized patient data meta-analysis, including future 
      studies with prospective homogenous study design, is required to adequately correct 
      for known risk factors and to provide definite conclusions with respect to carotid 
      stent design for specific subgroups.

TI  - Prognostic and Predictive Value of Microsatellite Instability, Inflammatory Reaction 
      and PD-L1 in Gastric Cancer Patients Treated with Either Adjuvant 5-FU/LV or 
      Sequential FOLFIRI Followed by Cisplatin and Docetaxel: A Translational Analysis 
      from the ITACA-S Trial.
PG  - e460-e468
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0471 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with high microsatellite instability (MSI) gastric cancer (GC) 
      show improved survival and no benefit or harm from adjuvant and/or perioperative 
      chemotherapy. The role of immune microenvironment in GC is largely unknown. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, 256 tumor tissue blocks were centrally 
      collected from patients enrolled in ITACA-S, a randomized adjuvant trial of 5-FU/LV 
      versus sequential FOLFIRI and cisplatin-docetaxel. MSI status was assessed by 
      multiplex PCR, inflammatory reaction by H&E morphological assessment, and programmed 
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Overall, 9% 
      patients had MSI-high tumors, 23% had high inflammatory reaction, 11% had tumor 
      PD-L1 ≥ 1%, and 11% had stromal PD-L1 ≥ 1%. A significant association with 
      disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was found for MSI-high (hazard 
      ratio [HR], 0.43; p = .02; HR, 0.40; p = .02) and high inflammatory reaction (HR, 
      0.55; p = .010; HR, 0.53; p = .008) but not for PD-L1. At multivariable analysis, 
      only MSI showed an independent association with both DFS (p = .02) and OS (p = .01), 
      whereas inflammatory reaction showed an independent association only with OS (p = 
      .04). Patients with tumor PD-L1 ≥ 1% had a significantly longer DFS in sequential 
      chemotherapy than in than 5-FU/LV arm (interaction p = .04) and a trend for OS 
      (interaction p = .12). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that MSI status could be a 
      useful prognostic biomarker in patients with radically resected stage II-III GC and 
      should be used as stratification factor in future trials. Tumor PD-L1 ≥ 1% should be 
      further investigated as a potential predictor of benefit from intensive 
      chemotherapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In this post hoc analysis of patients with 
      radically resected gastric cancer randomized to an intensive sequential chemotherapy 
      regimen versus 5-FU/LV monotherapy as adjuvant treatment in the ITACA-S trial, 
      MSI-high status was independently associated with better disease-free survival and 
      overall survival (OS) and inflammatory reaction was independently associated with 
      better OS. Moreover, tumor PD-L1 expression ≥1% was associated with greater benefit 
      from intensive sequential chemotherapy compared with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin 
      (5-FU/LV), whereas PD-L1 expression <1% was not, conditioning a statistically 
      significant interaction between such biomarker and treatment arms. The meta-analysis 
      of individual patients' data from available studies could yield data on the role of 
      MSI status that could inform clinical decisions.

AB  - We evaluated the efficacy and acceptability of transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS) for treating acute depressive episodes using individual patient 
      data that provide more precise estimates than aggregate data meta-analysis. A 
      systematic review of placebo-controlled trials on tDCS as only intervention was 
      conducted until December-2018. Data from each study was collated to estimate odds 
      ratio (OR) and number needed to treat (NNT) of response and remission, and 
      depression improvement. Endpoints were pre-determined. Nine eligible studies (572 
      participants), presenting moderate/high certainty of evidence, were included. Active 
      tDCS was significantly superior to sham for response (30.9% vs. 18.9% respectively; 
      OR = 1.96, 95%CI [1.30-2.95], NNT = 9), remission (19.9% vs. 11.7%, OR = 1.94 
      [1.19-3.16], NNT = 13) and depression improvement (effect size of β = 0.31, 
      [0.15-0.47]). Moreover, continuous clinical improvement was observed even after the 
      end of acute tDCS treatment. There were no differences in all-cause discontinuation 
      rates and no predictors of response were identified. To conclude, active tDCS was 
      statistically superior to sham in all outcomes, although its clinical effects were 
      moderate.

TI  - Cognitive-Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy, Drug, or Their Combination 
      for Persistent Depressive Disorder: Personalizing the Treatment Choice Using 
      Individual Participant Data Network Metaregression.
PG  - 140-153
LID - 10.1159/000489227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent depressive disorder is prevalent, disabling, and often 
      difficult to treat. The cognitive-behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy 
      (CBASP) is the only psychotherapy specifically developed for its treatment. However, 
      we do not know which of CBASP, antidepressant pharmacotherapy, or their combination 
      is the most efficacious and for which types of patients. This study aims to present 
      personalized prediction models to facilitate shared decision-making in treatment 
      choices to match patients' characteristics and preferences based on individual 
      participant data network metaregression. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive 
      search for randomized controlled trials comparing any two of CBASP, pharmacotherapy, 
      or their combination and sought individual participant data from identified trials. 
      The primary outcomes were reduction in depressive symptom severity for efficacy and 
      dropouts due to any reason for treatment acceptability. RESULTS: All 3 identified 
      studies (1,036 participants) were included in the present analyses. On average, the 
      combination therapy showed significant superiority over both monotherapies in terms 
      of efficacy and acceptability, while the latter 2 treatments showed essentially 
      similar results. Baseline depression, anxiety, prior pharmacotherapy, age, and 
      depression subtypes moderated their relative efficacy, which indicated that for 
      certain subgroups of patients either drug therapy or CBASP alone was a recommendable 
      treatment option that is less costly, may have fewer adverse effects and match an 
      individual patient's preferences. An interactive web app 
      (https://kokoro.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/CBASP/prediction/) shows the predicted disease 
      course for all possible combinations of patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Individual participant data network metaregression enables treatment recommendations 
      based on individual patient characteristics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: When investigating subgroup effects in meta-analysis, it is unclear 
      whether accounting in meta-regression for between-trial variation in treatment 
      effects, but not between-trial variation in treatment interaction effects when such 
      effects are present, leads to biased estimates, coverage problems, or wrong standard 
      errors, and whether the use of aggregate data (AD) or individual-patient-data (IPD) 
      influences this assessment. METHODS: Seven different models were compared in a 
      simulation study. Models differed regarding the use of AD or IPD, whether they 
      accounted for between-trial variation in interaction effects, and whether they 
      minimized the risk of ecological fallacy. RESULTS: Models that used IPD and that 
      allowed for between-trial variation of the interaction effect had less bias, better 
      coverage, and more accurate standard errors than models that used AD or ignored this 
      variation. The main factor influencing the performance of models was whether they 
      used IPD or AD. The model that used AD had a considerably worse performance than all 
      models that used IPD, especially when a low number of trials was included in the 
      analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that IPD models that allow for the 
      between-trial variation in interaction effects should be given preference whenever 
      investigating subgroup effects within a meta-analysis.

TI  - One-Day Versus Three-Day Dexamethasone in Combination with Palonosetron for the 
      Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: A Systematic Review and 
      Individual Patient Data-Based Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1593-1600
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0133 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A dexamethasone-sparing regimen consisting of palonosetron plus 1-day 
      dexamethasone for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) 
      has been studied previously. Here, we evaluate the noninferiority of the 
      dexamethasone-sparing regimen in overall antiemetic control using a meta-analysis 
      based on individual patient data (IPD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a 
      systematic review for randomized trials reporting CINV outcomes for the comparison 
      of palonosetron plus 1-day dexamethasone (d1 arm) versus the same regimen followed 
      by dexamethasone on days 2-3 after chemotherapy (d3 arm) in chemotherapy-naïve adult 
      patients undergoing either moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline 
      plus cyclophosphamide (AC)-containing chemotherapy. PubMed and MEDLINE were searched 
      electronically. A manual search was also conducted. The primary endpoint was 
      complete response (CR; no emesis and no rescue medication) in the overall 5-day 
      study period. The noninferiority margin was set at -8.0% (d1 arm-d3 arm). RESULTS: 
      Five studies (n = 1,194) were eligible for analysis and all IPD was collected. In 
      the overall study period, the d1 arm showed noninferiority to the d3 arm for CR as 
      well as complete control (pooled risk difference in CR rate - 1.5%, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] -7.1 to 4.0%, I(2) = 0%; in complete control rate - 2.4%, 95% CI -7.7 
      to 2.9%, I(2) = 0%). There was no significant interaction between dexamethasone 
      regimen and risk factors (type of chemotherapy, sex, age, and alcohol consumption). 
      CONCLUSION: This IPD meta-analysis indicates that the dexamethasone-sparing regimen 
      is not associated with a significant loss in overall antiemetic control in patients 
      undergoing MEC or AC-containing chemotherapy, irrespective of known risk factors for 
      CINV. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Although dexamethasone in combination with other 
      antiemetic agents has been used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting 
      (CINV), it is of clinical importance to minimize total dose of dexamethasone in 
      patients undergoing multiple cycles of emetogenic chemotherapy. This 
      individual-patient-data meta-analysis from five randomized controlled trials (1,194 
      patients) demonstrated a noninferiority of the dexamethasone-sparing regimen for 
      complete response and complete control of CINV. The outcomes were comparable across 
      patients with different characteristics. These findings thus help physicians 
      minimize use of the steroid and further reduce the burden of dexamethasone-related 
      side effects in patients undergoing multiple consecutive courses of emetogenic 
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Cost effectiveness of guided Internet-based interventions for depression in 
      comparison with control conditions: An individual-participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - 209-219

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence on the cost effectiveness of Internet-based 
      treatments for depression. The aim was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of guided 
      Internet-based interventions for depression compared to controls. METHODS: 
      Individual-participant data from five randomized controlled trials (RCT), including 
      1,426 participants, were combined. Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted at 
      8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up. RESULTS: The guided Internet-based 
      interventions were more costly than the controls, but not statistically significant 
      (12 months mean difference = €406, 95% CI: - 611 to 1,444). The mean differences in 
      clinical effects were not statistically significant (12 months mean 
      difference = 1.75, 95% CI: - .09 to 3.60 in Center for Epidemiologic Studies 
      Depression Scale [CES-D] score, .06, 95% CI: - .02 to .13 in response rate, and .00, 
      95% CI: - .03 to .03 in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]). Cost-effectiveness 
      acceptability curves indicated that high investments are needed to reach an 
      acceptable probability that the intervention is cost effective compared to control 
      for CES-D and response to treatment (e.g., at 12-month follow-up the probability of 
      being cost effective was .95 at a ceiling ratio of 2,000 €/point of improvement in 
      CES-D score). For QALYs, the intervention's probability of being cost effective 
      compared to control was low at the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold 
      (e.g., at 12-month follow-up the probability was .29 and. 31 at a ceiling ratio of 
      24,000 and 35,000 €/QALY, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present findings, 
      guided Internet-based interventions for depression are not considered cost effective 
      compared to controls. However, only a minority of RCTs investigating the clinical 
      effectiveness of guided Internet-based interventions also assessed cost 
      effectiveness and were included in this individual-participant data meta-analysis.

TI  - Relationship between microvascular obstruction and adverse events following primary 
      percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: 
      an individual patient data pooled analysis from seven randomized trials.
PG  - 3502-3510
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehx414 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Microvascular obstruction (MVO) is the underlying cause for the no-reflow 
      phenomenon in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The association 
      between MVO assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and prognosis has 
      not been convincingly demonstrated. We sought to determine the relationship between 
      MVO assessed early after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in STEMI 
      and all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure (HF), and reinfarction. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a pooled analysis using individual patient data 
      from seven randomized primary PCI trials in which MVO was assessed within 7 days 
      after reperfusion by CMR using late gadolinium enhancement imaging (n = 1688). 
      Clinical follow-up was performed for at least 6 months after the index event. Median 
      time to CMR after STEMI was 3 days [interquartile range (IQR) 2-4], and median 
      duration of clinical follow-up was 365 days (IQR 188-374). Microvascular obstruction 
      was present in 960 (56.9%) of patients, and median MVO (percent left ventricular 
      myocardial mass) was 0.47% (IQR 0.00-2.54). A graded response was present between 
      the extent of MVO (per 1.0% absolute increase) and subsequent mortality [Cox 
      adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.19, P < 0.0001] 
      and hospitalization for HF (Cox adjusted HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05-1.12, P < 0.0001). 
      Microvascular obstruction remained significantly associated with all-cause mortality 
      even after further adjustment for infarct size (Cox adjusted HR 1.09, 95% CI 
      1.01-1.17, P = 0.03). MVO was not significantly related to subsequent reinfarction 
      (P = 0.29). CONCLUSIONS: The presence and extent of MVO measured by CMR after 
      primary PCI in STEMI are strongly associated with mortality and hospitalization for 
      HF within 1 year.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Two recent randomised trials studied the benefit of mineralocorticoid 
      receptor antagonists (MRAs) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) 
      irrespective or in absence of heart failure. The studies were both undersized to 
      assess hard clinical endpoints. A pooled analysis was preplanned by the steering 
      committees. METHODS: We conducted a prespecified meta-analysis of patient-level data 
      of patients with STEMI recruited in two multicentre superiority trials, randomised 
      within 72 hours after symptom onset. Patients were allocated (1:1) to two MRA 
      regimens: (1) an intravenous bolus of potassium canrenoate (200 mg) followed by oral 
      spironolactone (25 mg once daily) versus standard therapy or (2) oral eplerenone 
      (25-50 mg) versus placebo. The primary and key secondary outcomes, all-cause death 
      and the composite of all-cause death or resuscitated sudden death, respectively, 
      were assessed in the intention-to-treat population using a Cox model stratified on 
      the study identifier. RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive (n=1118) 
      or not the MRA regimen (n=1123). After a median follow-up time of 188 days, the 
      primary and secondary outcomes occurred in 5 (0.4%) and 17 (1.5%) patients (adjusted 
      HR (adjHR) 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.86, p=0.03) and 6 (0.5%) and 22 (2%) patients 
      (adjHR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.65, p=0.004) in the MRA and control groups, 
      respectively. There were also trends towards lower rates of cardiovascular death 
      (p=0.06) and ventricular fibrillation (p=0.08) in the MRA group. CONCLUSION: Our 
      analysis suggests that compared with standard therapy, MRA regimens are associated 
      with a reduction of death and death or resuscitated sudden death in STEMI.

TI  - Co-occurring change in children's conduct problems and maternal depression: Latent 
      class individual participant data meta-analysis of the Incredible Years parenting 
      program.
PG  - 1851-1862
LID - 10.1017/S0954579419001068 [doi]
AB  - Children vary in the extent to which they benefit from parenting programs for 
      conduct problems. How does parental mental health change if children benefit less or 
      more? We assessed whether changes in conduct problems and maternal depressive 
      symptoms co-occur following participation in the Incredible Years parenting program. 
      We integrated individual participant data from 10 randomized trials (N = 1280; 
      children aged 2-10 years) and distinguished latent classes based on families' 
      baseline and post-test conduct problems and maternal depressive symptoms, using 
      repeated measures latent class analysis (RMLCA) and latent transition analysis 
      (LTA). Classes differed mainly in severity of conduct problems and depression 
      (RMLCA; 4 classes). Conduct problems reduced in all classes. Depressive symptoms did 
      not change in most classes, except in a class of families where conduct problems and 
      depression were particularly severe. Incredible Years led to a greater likelihood of 
      families with particularly severe conduct problems and depression moving to a class 
      with mild problems (LTA; 3 classes). Our findings suggest that for the majority of 
      families, children's conduct problems reduce, but maternal depressive symptoms do 
      not, suggesting relative independence, with the exception of families with severe 
      depression and severe conduct problems where changes for the better do co-occur.

TI  - Pooled analysis of higher versus lower blood pressure targets for vasopressor 
      therapy septic and vasodilatory shock.
PG  - 12-21
LID - 10.1007/s00134-017-5016-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Guidelines for shock recommend mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets for 
      vasopressor therapy of at least 65 mmHg and, until recently, suggested that patients 
      with underlying chronic hypertension and atherosclerosis may benefit from higher 
      targets. We conducted an individual patient-data meta-analysis of recent trials to 
      determine if patient variables modify the effect of different MAP targets. METHODS: 
      We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      for randomized controlled trials of higher versus lower blood pressure targets for 
      vasopressor therapy in adult patients in shock (until November 2017). After 
      obtaining individual patient data from both eligible trials, we used a modified 
      version of the Cochrane Collaboration's instrument to assess the risk of bias of 
      included trials. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Included trials 
      enrolled 894 patients. Controlling for trial and site, the OR for 28-day mortality 
      for the higher versus lower MAP targets was 1.15 (95% CI 0.87-1.52). Treatment 
      effect varied by duration of vasopressors before randomization (interaction 
      p = 0.017), but not by chronic hypertension, congestive heart failure or age. Risk 
      of death increased in higher MAP groups among patients on vasopressors > 6 h before 
      randomization (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.33-6.74). CONCLUSIONS: Targeting higher blood 
      pressure targets may increase mortality in patients who have been treated with 
      vasopressors for more than 6 h. Lower blood pressure targets were not associated 
      with patient-important adverse events in any subgroup, including chronically 
      hypertensive patients.

TI  - Characteristics of insulin-Naïve people with type 2 diabetes who successfully 
      respond to insulin glargine U100 after 24 weeks of treatment: a meta-analysis of 
      individual participant data from 3 randomized clinical trials.
PG  - 10

LID - 10
AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify baseline/clinical characteristics associated with clinically 
      meaningful responses to insulin glargine 100 U/mL (IGlar) in insulin-naive people 
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Individual participant data were 
      pooled from 3 randomized trials to compare baseline characteristics and clinical 
      outcomes associated with 24-week response to IGlar in combination with non-insulin 
      antihyperglycemic agents in participants with T2DM. Responders were defined as 
      achieving endpoint HbA1c target < 53 mmol/mol (< 7%) and/or ≥ 11 mmol/mol (≥ 1%) 
      HbA1c reduction from baseline. RESULTS: Differences in baseline characteristics for 
      responders versus nonresponders were higher HbA1c (99 vs 91 mmol/mol [9.1 vs 8.3%]; 
      P < 0.001), higher fasting blood glucose (FBG; 10.4 vs 8.8 mmol/L [187 vs 159 mg/dL; 
      P < 0.001), and fewer participants (94% vs 98%; P = 0.006) taking oral medications 
      targeting postprandial blood glucose (BG). Most participants (80%) achieved one or 
      both components of composite endpoint. 12-week response was a strong predictor of 
      subsequent 24-week response (sensitivity, 85.9%; predictive positive value, 91.4%). 
      At both 12 and 24 weeks, < 40% of responders and nonresponders reached target FBG 
      ≤ 5.6 mmol/L (≤ 100 mg/dL). Responders at 24 weeks had higher incidence of 
      hypoglycemia (total, 82.5% vs 70.4%; P < 0.001; nocturnal, 60.3% vs 50.5%; 
      P = 0.002; documented symptomatic, 65.8% vs 55.6%; P < 0.001) than nonresponders. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Baseline characteristics associated with response were identified. The 
      strong predictability of 12-week response suggests that the magnitude of early HbA1c 
      reduction should be considered when assessing response to IGlar. More aggressive 
      IGlar titration may be reasonable for nonresponders and responders who have not 
      reached FBG and HbA1c targets, taking into account other BG timepoints.

AB  - Various trials and meta-analyses have reported conflicting results concerning the 
      application of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) for sepsis and septic shock. The 
      aim of this study was to update the evidence by performing a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis. Multiple databases were searched from initial through August, 2016 
      for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the associations between 
      the use of EGDT and mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock. Meta-analysis 
      was performed using random-effects model and heterogeneity was examined through 
      subgroup analyses. The primary outcome of interest was patient all-cause mortality 
      including hospital or ICU mortality. Seventeen RCTs including 6207 participants with 
      3234 in the EGDT group and 2973 in the control group were eligible for this study. 
      Meta-analysis showed that EGDT did not significantly reduce hospital or intensive 
      care unit (ICU) mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02) compared 
      with control group for patients with sepsis or septic shock. The findings of 
      subgroup analyses stratified by study region, number of research center, year of 
      enrollment, clinical setting, sample size, timing of EGDT almost remained constant 
      with that of the primary analysis. Our findings provide evidence that EGDT offers 
      neutral survival effects for patients with sepsis or septic shock. Further 
      meta-analyses based on larger well-designed RCTs or individual patient data 
      meta-analysis are required to explore the survival benefits of EDGT in patients with 
      sepsis or septic shock.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa/lutropin alfa in ART: a randomized 
      controlled trial in poor ovarian responders.
PG  - 544-555
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dew360 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: How does the efficacy and safety of a fixed-ratio combination of 
      recombinant human FSH plus recombinant human LH (follitropin alfa plus lutropin 
      alfa; r-hFSH/r-hLH) compare with that of r-hFSH monotherapy for controlled ovarian 
      stimulation (COS) in patients with poor ovarian response (POR)? SUMMARY ANSWER: The 
      primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were comparable between treatment groups 
      and the safety profile of both treatment regimens was favourable. WHAT IS KNOWN 
      ALREADY: Although meta-analyses of clinical trials have suggested some beneficial 
      effect on reproductive outcomes with r-hLH supplementation in patients with POR, the 
      definitions of POR were heterogeneous and limit the comparability across studies. 
      STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Phase III, single-blind, active-comparator, 
      randomized, parallel-group clinical trial. Patients were followed for a single ART 
      cycle. A total of 939 women were randomized (1:1) to receive either r-hFSH/r-hLH or 
      r-hFSH. Randomization, stratified by study site and participant age, was conducted 
      via an interactive voice response system. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: 
      Women classified as having POR, based on criteria incorporating the ESHRE Bologna 
      criteria, were down-regulated with a long GnRH agonist protocol and following 
      successful down-regulation were randomized (1:1) to COS with r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH 
      alone. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of oocytes retrieved following 
      COS. Safety endpoints included the incidence of adverse events, including ovarian 
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Post hoc analyses investigated safety outcomes and 
      correlations between live birth and baseline characteristics (age and number of 
      oocytes retrieved in previous ART treatment cycles or serum anti-Müllerian hormone 
      (AMH)). The significance of the treatment effect was tested by generalized linear 
      models (Poisson regression for counts and logistic regression for binary endpoints) 
      adjusting for age and country. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of 949 subjects 
      achieving down-regulation, 939 were randomized to r-hFSH/r-hLH (n = 477) or r-hFSH 
      (n = 462) and received treatment. Efficacy assessment: In the intention-to-treat 
      (ITT) population, the mean (SD) number of oocytes retrieved (primary endpoint) was 
      3.3 (2.71) in the r-hFSH/r-hLH group compared with 3.6 (2.82) in the r-hFSH group 
      (between-group difference not statistically significant). The observed difference 
      between treatment groups (r-hFSH/r-hLH and r-hFSH, respectively) for efficacy 
      outcomes decreased over the course of pregnancy (biochemical pregnancy rate: 17.3% 
      versus 23.9%; clinical pregnancy rate: 14.1% versus 16.8%; ongoing pregnancy rate: 
      11.0% versus 12.4%; and live birth rate: 10.6% versus 11.7%). An interaction 
      (identified post hoc) between baseline characteristics related to POR and treatment 
      effect was noted for live birth, with r-hFSH/r-hLH associated with a higher live 
      birth rate for patients with moderate or severe POR, whereas r-hFSH was associated 
      with a higher live birth rate for those with mild POR. A post hoc logistic 
      regression analysis indicated that the incidence of total pregnancy outcome failure 
      was lower in the r-hFSH/r-hLH group (6.7%) compared with the r-hFSH group (12.4%) 
      with an odds ratio of 0.52 (95% CI 0.33, 0.82; P = 0.005). Safety assessment: The 
      overall proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
      occurring during or after r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH use (stimulation or 
      post-stimulation phase) was 19.9% and 26.8%, respectively. There was no consistent 
      pattern of TEAEs associated with either treatment. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: 
      Despite using inclusion criteria for POR incorporating the ESHRE Bologna criteria, 
      further investigation is needed to determine the impact of the heterogeneity of POR 
      in the Bologna patient population. The observed correlation between baseline 
      clinical characteristics related to POR and live birth rate, as well as the observed 
      differences between groups regarding total pregnancy outcome failure were from post 
      hoc analyses, and the study was not powered for these endpoints. In addition, the 
      attrition rate for pregnancy outcomes in this trial may not reflect general medical 
      practice. Furthermore, as the patient population was predominantly White these 
      results might not be applicable to other ethnicities. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE 
      FINDINGS: In the population of women with POR investigated in this study, although 
      the number of oocytes retrieved was similar following stimulation with either a 
      fixed-ratio combination of r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH monotherapy, post hoc analyses 
      showed that there was a lower rate of total pregnancy outcome failure in patients 
      receiving r-hFSH/r-hLH, in addition to a higher live birth rate in patients with 
      moderate and severe POR. These findings are clinically relevant and require 
      additional investigation. The benefit:risk balance of treatment with either 
      r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH remains positive. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This

TI  - Comparison of Whole-Body Electromyostimulation versus Recognized Back-Strengthening 
      Exercise Training on Chronic Nonspecific Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled 
      Study.
PG  - 5745409

LID - 5745409
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) affects almost everyone at least once in their 
      lifetime. Various meta-analyses show promising effects on pain reduction for 
      conventional exercise. However, the lack of time and, especially for pain patients, 
      a fear of movement ("kinesiophobia") as well as functional limitations often oppose 
      participation in such activities. In contrast, the advantage of novel training 
      technologies like whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) lies particularly in a 
      joint-friendly, time-effective, and highly customized training protocol and might be 
      an alternative option for LBP patients. A meta-analysis of individual patient data 
      and a comparison of WB-EMS against a passive control group confirmed the proof 
      principle. Thus, the aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare WB-EMS 
      with a recognized back-strengthening exercise protocol to determine the 
      corresponding effects on chronic, nonspecific LBP in people suffering from this. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: This randomized, controlled multicenter study is focused on 
      novel and time-effective training technologies and LBP. In this contribution, the 
      focus is primarily on the comparison of WB-EMS against a comparable conventional 
      exercise training (CT). One hundred ten nonspecific chronic LBP patients, 40-70 
      years old, were randomly allocated to the intervention arms (WB-EMS: 55 vs. CT: 55). 
      Both groups completed a 12-week program (WB-EMS: 1 × 20 min/week vs. CT: 
      1 × 45 min/week) specifically dedicated to LBP. The selection of the content of the 
      active control group was based on the principles of WB-EMS training, which uses 
      electrical stimulation to train mainly strength and stabilization in a very short 
      time. Exercises were similar in all groups, with the focus on strengthening and 
      stabilizing the trunk. Outcome measures were assessed by a four-week pain diary 
      (before and during the last four weeks of intervention) as well as an isometric 
      maximum strength measurement of the trunk muscles at baseline and after 12 weeks of 
      intervention. Primary study endpoint was average pain intensity at the lumbar spine. 
      Secondary study endpoints were maximum isometric strength of the back and the 
      abdominals. The mean pain intensity of LBP decreased significantly in both groups 
      (WB-EMS: -22.3 ± 20.9% vs. CT: -30.2 ± 43.9%; p < 0.001), however, without 
      significant intergroup difference (p=0.160). A similar result was observed for 
      "maximum isometric strength of trunk muscles." The increase in back strength 
      (WB-EMS: 15.6 ± 24.9% vs. CT: 23.0 ± 30.9%) was highly significant in both groups 
      (p=0.001), and similar changes were observed for the trunk flexors (WB-EMS: 
      17.6 ± 24.8% vs. CT: 18.1 ± 24.8%). Also, at the secondary endpoint, no significant 
      difference in pairwise comparison was observed in both cases (extension: p=0.297; 
      flexion: p=0.707). CONCLUSION: In summary, both, WB-EMS and conventional 
      back-strengthening protocol are comparably effective in reducing nonspecific chronic 
      LBP in this dedicated cohort. The result is particularly positive in terms of time 
      effectiveness and offers an adequate alternative for people with limited time 
      resources or other barriers to conventional training methods.

      less to antidepressants. However, meaningful effect modifiers (variables associated 
      with differential response depending on the treatment) are yet to be identified. 
      METHODS: We conducted individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis and 
      meta-regression to explore effect modifiers in placebo-controlled antidepressant 
      trials conducted so far in Japan. RESULTS: We obtained access to IPD from seven 
      placebo-controlled trials comparing bupropion, duloxetine, escitalopram, 
      mirtazapine, paroxetine or venlafaxine with placebo in the acute phase treatment of 
      major depression (total n = 2803). The higher the guilt subscale score of the 
      baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), the greater the difference in 
      reduction in depression severity between the antidepressants and placebo at week 6, 
      while the older the current age or the age at onset, the smaller the difference. At 
      week 8, the guilt subscale score of HRSD and presence of suicidal ideation at 
      baseline predicted greater, and the anhedonia subscale and insomnia subscale scores 
      of HRSD and early response at week 2 predicted smaller, difference in reduction. 
      LIMITATIONS: Different studies measured different sets of baseline variables and we 
      were able to analyze only a limited set of candidate variables for effect 
      modification. CONCLUSION: Age, age at onset, several HRSD subscales including guilt, 
      anhedonia and insomnia, presence of suicidal ideation at baseline and early response 
      are potential effect modifiers for response to antidepressants in the acute phase 
      antidepressant treatment of major depression. Future trials need to measure these 
      and additional variables in concerted efforts to enable matching of treatments with 
      individual characteristics in depression.

TI  - Individual participant data meta-analysis of continuous outcomes: A comparison of 
      approaches for specifying and estimating one-stage models.
PG  - 4404-4420
LID - 10.1002/sim.7930 [doi]
AB  - One-stage individual participant data meta-analysis models should account for 
      within-trial clustering, but it is currently debated how to do this. For continuous 
      outcomes modeled using a linear regression framework, two competing approaches are a 
      stratified intercept or a random intercept. The stratified approach involves 
      estimating a separate intercept term for each trial, whereas the random intercept 
      approach assumes that trial intercepts are drawn from a normal distribution. Here, 
      through an extensive simulation study for continuous outcomes, we evaluate the 
      impact of using the stratified and random intercept approaches on statistical 
      properties of the summary treatment effect estimate. Further aims are to compare (i) 
      competing estimation options for the one-stage models, including maximum likelihood 
      and restricted maximum likelihood, and (ii) competing options for deriving 
      confidence intervals (CI) for the summary treatment effect, including the standard 
      normal-based 95% CI, and more conservative approaches of Kenward-Roger and 
      Satterthwaite, which inflate CIs to account for uncertainty in variance estimates. 
      The findings reveal that, for an individual participant data meta-analysis of 
      randomized trials with a 1:1 treatment:control allocation ratio and heterogeneity in 
      the treatment effect, (i) bias and coverage of the summary treatment effect estimate 
      are very similar when using stratified or random intercept models with restricted 
      maximum likelihood, and thus either approach could be taken in practice, (ii) CIs 
      are generally best derived using either a Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite correction, 
      although occasionally overly conservative, and (iii) if maximum likelihood is 
      required, a random intercept performs better than a stratified intercept model. An 
      illustrative example is provided.

TI  - Tissue sealants for the prevention of lymphoceles after radical inguinal lymph node 
      dissection in patients with melanoma: A systematic review and individual patient 
      data meta-analysis.
PG  - 728-736
LID - 10.1002/jso.25366 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Postoperative lymphoceles and further wound complications 
      occur frequently after radical inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND). In various 
      studies, tissue sealants have shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative 
      morbidity. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of tissue sealants in reducing the 
      incidence of postoperative lymphoceles following ILND in patients with melanoma was 
      conducted. Individual patient data was requested to pool the data for meta-analysis 
      appropriately. RESULTS: Thousand seven hundred twenty-nine manuscripts were screened 
      for eligibility. Six RCTs published between 1986 and 2012 were identified including 
      194 patients for ILND. Only four RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. No study 
      properly defined the term "lymphocele." Tissue sealants failed to influence the 
      duration of drain placement (mean difference [MD] = -3.05 days; z = 1.18; P = 0.24), 
      total drainage volume (MD = 598.39 mL; z = 1.49; P = 0.14), the incidence of 
      postoperative seroma, wound infection and skin necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: No improvement 
      was identified with the use of tissue sealants, however, a valid comparison of the 
      results of included trials was difficult owing to the lack of a definition of the 
      term "lymphocele." Other surgical techniques and trials using validated endpoint 
      definitions are required to reevaluate these findings.

TI  - Cerclage for short cervix in twin pregnancies: systematic review and meta-analysis 
      of randomized trials using individual patient-level data.
PG  - 352-8
LID - 10.1111/aogs.12600 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of cerclage for preventing preterm birth in twin 
      pregnancies with a short cervical length. DESIGN: We performed an individual patient 
      data meta-analysis. Searches were performed in electronic databases. SETTING: Sidney 
      Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA. 
      POPULATION: Twin pregnancies in mothers with short cervical length. METHODS: We 
      performed an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized trials of twin 
      pregnancies screened by transvaginal ultrasound in second trimester and where 
      mothers had a short cervical length <25 mm before 24 weeks. Eligible women had to be 
      randomized to cerclage vs. no-cerclage (control). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome was preterm birth <34 weeks. RESULTS: Three trials with 49 twin gestations 
      with a short cervical length were identified. All original databases for each 
      included trial were obtained from the primary authors. Risk factors were similar in 
      the cerclage and control groups, except that previous preterm birth was more 
      frequent and gestational age at randomization and delivery were earlier in the 
      cerclage group compared with the control group. Adjusting for previous preterm birth 
      and gestational age at randomization, there were no statistically significant 
      differences in primary (adjusted odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 0.23-3.79) 
      and secondary outcomes. Rates of very low birthweight and of respiratory distress 
      syndrome were significantly higher in the cerclage group than in the control group. 
      CONCLUSION: Based on these Level 1 data, cerclage cannot currently be recommended 
      for clinical use in twin pregnancies with a maternal short cervical length in the 
      second trimester. Large trials are still necessary.

TI  - The effects of deep-brain non-stimulation in severe obsessive-compulsive disorder: 
      an individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 183

LID - 183
AB  - Non-intervention-related effects have long been recognized in an array of medical 
      interventions, to which surgical procedures like deep-brain stimulation are no 
      exception. While the existence of placebo and micro-lesion effects has been 
      convincingly demonstrated in DBS for major depression and Parkinson's disease, 
      systematic investigations for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are currently 
      lacking. We therefore undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis with the 
      aim of quantifying the effect of DBS for severe, treatment-resistant OCD that is not 
      due to the electrical stimulation of brain tissue. The MEDLINE/PubMed database was 
      searched for double-blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical trials published in 
      English between 1998 and 2018. Individual patient data was obtained from the 
      original authors and combined in a meta-analysis. We assessed differences from 
      baseline in obsessive-compulsive symptoms following sham treatment, as measured by 
      the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Four studies met the inclusion 
      criteria, randomizing 49 patients to two periods of active or sham stimulation. To 
      preclude confounding by period effects, our estimate was based only on data from 
      those patients who underwent sham stimulation first (n = 24). We found that sham 
      stimulation induced a significant change in the Y-BOCS score (t = -3.15, P < 0.005), 
      lowering it by 4.9 ± 1.6 points [95% CI = (-8.0, -1.8)]. We conclude that 
      non-stimulation-related effects of DBS exist also in OCD. The identification of the 
      factors determining the magnitude and occurrence of these effects will help to 
      design strategies that will ultimately lead to a betterment of future randomized 
      clinical trials.

TI  - D-Cycloserine Augmentation of Exposure-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Anxiety, 
      Obsessive-Compulsive, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis of Individual Participant Data.
PG  - 501-510
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.3955 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Whether and under which conditions D-cycloserine (DCS) augments the 
      effects of exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety, 
      obsessive-compulsive, and posttraumatic stress disorders is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To 
      clarify whether DCS is superior to placebo in augmenting the effects of cognitive 
      behavior therapy for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and posttraumatic stress 
      disorders and to evaluate whether antidepressants interact with DCS and the effect 
      of potential moderating variables. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were 
      searched from inception to February 10, 2016. Reference lists of previous reviews 
      and meta-analyses and reports of randomized clinical trials were also checked. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were (1) double-blind 
      randomized clinical trials of DCS as an augmentation strategy for exposure-based 
      cognitive behavior therapy and (2) conducted in humans diagnosed as having specific 
      phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder. DATA EXTRACTION AND 
      SYNTHESIS: Raw data were obtained from the authors and quality controlled. Data were 
      ranked to ensure a consistent metric across studies (score range, 0-100). We used a 
      3-level multilevel model nesting repeated measures of outcomes within participants, 
      who were nested within studies. RESULTS: Individual participant data were obtained 
      for 21 of 22 eligible trials, representing 1047 of 1073 eligible participants. When 
      controlling for antidepressant use, participants receiving DCS showed greater 
      improvement from pretreatment to posttreatment (mean difference, -3.62; 95% CI, 
      -0.81 to -6.43; P = .01; d = -0.25) but not from pretreatment to midtreatment (mean 
      difference, -1.66; 95% CI, -4.92 to 1.60; P = .32; d = -0.14) or from pretreatment 
      to follow-up (mean difference, -2.98, 95% CI, -5.99 to 0.03; P = .05; d = -0.19). 
      Additional analyses showed that participants assigned to DCS were associated with 
      lower symptom severity than those assigned to placebo at posttreatment and at 
      follow-up. Antidepressants did not moderate the effects of DCS. None of the 
      prespecified patient-level or study-level moderators was associated with outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: D-cycloserine is associated with a small augmentation 
      effect on exposure-based therapy. This effect is not moderated by the concurrent use 
      of antidepressants. Further research is needed to identify patient and/or therapy 
      characteristics associated with DCS response.

AB  - Background and Purpose- There is contradictory evidence on the impact of the stroke 
      side (hemisphere) on outcomes. We investigated any effect modification by laterality 
      on stroke patients' outcomes in recent endovascular trials. Methods- Individual 
      patient-level data were combined in this meta-analysis of all patients included in 
      randomized trials comparing endovascular thrombectomy predominantly done with stent 
      retrievers with standard care in anterior circulation ischemic patients with stroke 
      (HERMES [Highly Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices] 
      Collaboration). We stratified the 90-day functional outcome assessed by ordinal 
      analysis of the modified Rankin Scale according to the stroke side of patients 
      treated with endovascular therapy versus standard care, adjusted for important 
      prognostic variables. Results- The meta-analysis included 1737 patients (871 right 
      hemispheric strokes and 866 left hemispheric) from 7 trials. Baseline median 
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were significantly higher in left 
      (20) versus right (16) hemispheric strokes (P<0.001). Other clinical and 
      radiological baseline characteristics were similar. The beneficial response to 
      endovascular therapy assessed by 90-day modified Rankin Scale shift was not modified 
      by the side of the stroke. There were no significant differences between right and 
      left hemispheric stroke in the 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 
      score ≤2; 40.7% [95% CI, 37.4%-44.1%] versus 37.6% [95% CI, 37.4%-44.1%]; P=0.19), 
      median final infarct volumes (45 versus 39.5 mL, P=0.51), nor 90-day mortality 
      (15.1% vs 16.8%, P=0.31). Conclusions- Stroke side was not a prognostic factor and 
      did not modify the treatment effect among patients treated in the endovascular or 
      control groups in recent endovascular thrombectomy trials.

TI  - Variability of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response with different doses of 
      atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin: results from VOYAGER.
PG  - 212-7
LID - 10.1093/ehjcvp/pvw006 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Patient response to statin treatment is individual and varied. As a 
      consequence, when using a specific-dose approach, as recommended in the 2013 
      American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline, there will be a 
      range of reductions in the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
      (LDL-C). The aim of this study was to use individual patient data from the VOYAGER 
      meta-analysis to determine the extent of the variability in LDL-C reduction in 
      response to treatment across the recommended doses of different statins. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: The percentage change from baseline in LDL-C was calculated using 
      individual subject data collected from 32 258 patients treated with atorvastatin 
      10-80 mg, rosuvastatin 5-40 mg, or simvastatin 10-80 mg. The percentage change in 
      LDL-C for each patient was then used to generate waterfall plots that demonstrated 
      the extent of the variability in response to treatment at all doses of the three 
      statins. The standard deviation of LDL-C reduction for all statins and doses ranged 
      from 12.8 to 17.9%. The percentage of patients experiencing a suboptimal response 
      (<30% reduction in LDL-C) ranged from 5.3 to 53.3%. CONCLUSION: These results 
      indicate that there is considerable individual variation in the LDL-C reduction at 
      all doses of simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin.

TI  - Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD).
PG  - CD009885
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009885.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most 
      commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, 
      children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, they are hyperactive and 
      impulsive.Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and 
      adolescents with ADHD but, despite its widespread use, this is the first 
      comprehensive systematic review of its benefits and harms. OBJECTIVES: To assess the 
      beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with 
      ADHD. SEARCH METHODS: In February 2015 we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index), and two 
      trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of 
      relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that 
      manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data. SELECTION 
      CRITERIA: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 
      methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 
      18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed 
      to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual 
      functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, 
      non-serious adverse events, general behaviour and quality of life. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of 
      bias assessment, and two review authors independently performed all tasks. We used 
      standard methodological procedures expected within Cochrane. Data from 
      parallel-group trials and first period data from cross-over trials formed the basis 
      of our primary analyses; separate analyses were undertaken using post-cross-over 
      data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses to control for type I 
      (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to 
      the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
      approach for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity and 
      publication bias. MAIN RESULTS: The studies.We included 38 parallel-group trials 
      (5111 participants randomised) and 147 cross-over trials (7134 participants 
      randomised). Participants included individuals of both sexes, at a boys-to-girls 
      ratio of 5:1, and participants' ages ranged from 3 to 18 years across most studies 
      (in two studies ages ranged from 3 to 21 years). The average age across all studies 
      was 9.7 years. Most participants were from high-income countries.The duration of 
      methylphenidate treatment ranged from 1 to 425 days, with an average duration of 75 
      days. Methylphenidate was compared to placebo (175 trials) or no intervention (10 
      trials). Risk of Bias.All 185 trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias. 
      Primary outcomes. Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms 
      (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.90 to 
      -0.64; 19 trials, 1698 participants; very low-quality evidence). This corresponds to 
      a mean difference (MD) of -9.6 points (95% CI -13.75 to -6.38) on the ADHD Rating 
      Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points; DuPaul 1991a). A change of 6.6 points on the 
      ADHD-RS is considered clinically to represent the minimal relevant difference. There 
      was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious 
      (e.g. life threatening) adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.22; 9 
      trials, 1532 participants; very low-quality evidence). The Trial Sequential 
      Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.02 to 33.2). SECONDARY 
      OUTCOMES: Among those prescribed methylphenidate, 526 per 1000 (range 448 to 615) 
      experienced non-serious adverse events, compared with 408 per 1000 in the control 
      group. This equates to a 29% increase in the overall risk of any non-serious adverse 
      events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51; 21 trials, 3132 participants; very low-quality 
      evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.29 
      (CI 1.06 to 1.56). The most common non-serious adverse events were sleep problems 
      and decreased appetite. Children in the methylphenidate group were at 60% greater 
      risk for trouble sleeping/sleep problems (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.23; 13 trials, 
      2416 participants), and 266% greater risk for decreased appetite (RR 3.66, 95% CI 
      2.56 to 5.23; 16 trials, 2962 participants) than children in the control 
      group.Teacher-rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD 
      -0.87, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.71; 5 trials, 668 participants; very low-quality 
      evidence).A change of seven points on the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ; range 0 
      to 100 points; Landgraf 1998) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant 
      difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a 
      MD of 8.0 points (95% CI 5.49 to 10.46) on the CHQ, which suggests that 
      methylphenidate may improve parent-reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 
      to 0.80; 3 trials, 514 participants; very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate may improve 
      teacher-reported ADHD symptoms, teacher-reported general behaviour, and 
      parent-reported quality of life among children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. 
      However, the low quality of the underpinning evidence means that we cannot be 
      certain of the magnitude of the effects. Within the short follow-up periods typical 
      of the included trials, there is some evidence that methylphenidate is associated 
      with increased risk of non-serious adverse events, such as sleep problems and 
      decreased appetite, but no evidence that it increases risk of serious adverse 
      events.Better designed trials are needed to assess the benefits of methylphenidate. 
      Given the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, 
      the particular difficulties for blinding of participants and outcome assessors point 
      to the advantage of large, 'nocebo tablet' controlled trials. These use a 
      placebo-like substance that causes adverse events in the control arm that are 
      comparable to those associated with methylphenidate. However, for ethical reasons, 
      such trials should first be conducted with adults, who can give their informed 
      consent.Future trials should publish depersonalised individual participant data and 
      report all outcomes, including adverse events. This will enable researchers 
      conducting systematic reviews to assess differences between intervention effects 
      according to age, sex, comorbidity, type of ADHD and dose. Finally, the findings 
      highlight the urgent need for large RCTs of non-pharmacological treatments.

TI  - Accuracy of screening women at familial risk of breast cancer without a known gene 
      mutation: Individual patient data meta-analysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Women with a strong family history of breast cancer (BC) and without a 
      known gene mutation have an increased risk of developing BC. We aimed to investigate 
      the accuracy of screening using annual mammography with or without magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) for these women outside the general population screening 
      program. METHODS: An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was conducted using 
      IPD from six prospective screening trials that had included women at increased risk 
      for BC: only women with a strong familial risk for BC and without a known gene 
      mutation were included in this analysis. A generalised linear mixed model was 
      applied to estimate and compare screening accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and 
      predictive values) for annual mammography with or without MRI. RESULTS: There were 
      2226 women (median age: 41 years, interquartile range 35-47) with 7478 woman-years 
      of follow-up, with a BC rate of 12 (95% confidence interval 9.3-14) in 1000 
      woman-years. Mammography screening had a sensitivity of 55% (standard error of mean 
      [SE] 7.0) and a specificity of 94% (SE 1.3). Screening with MRI alone had a 
      sensitivity of 89% (SE 4.6) and a specificity of 83% (SE 2.8). Adding MRI to 
      mammography increased sensitivity to 98% (SE 1.8, P < 0.01 compared to mammography 
      alone) but lowered specificity to 79% (SE 2.7, P < 0.01 compared with mammography 
      alone). CONCLUSION: In this population of women with strong familial BC risk but 
      without a known gene mutation, in whom BC incidence was high both before and after 
      age 50, adding MRI to mammography substantially increased screening sensitivity but 
      also decreased its specificity.

TI  - Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Blood Pressure: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis Incorporating Individual Patient Data.
PG  - 745-54
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.0237 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Low levels of vitamin D are associated with elevated blood pressure (BP) 
      and future cardiovascular events. Whether vitamin D supplementation reduces BP and 
      which patient characteristics predict a response remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To 
      systematically review whether supplementation with vitamin D or its analogues reduce 
      BP. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials, and http://www.ClinicalTrials.com augmented by a hand search of 
      references from the included articles and previous reviews. Google was searched for 
      gray literature (ie, material not published in recognized scientific journals). No 
      language restrictions were applied. The search period spanned January 1, 1966, 
      through March 31, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized placebo-controlled 
      clinical trials that used vitamin D supplementation for a minimum of 4 weeks for any 
      indication and reported BP data. Studies were included if they used active or 
      inactive forms of vitamin D or vitamin D analogues. Cointerventions were permitted 
      if identical in all treatment arms. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We extracted data 
      on baseline demographics, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, systolic and diastolic BP (SBP 
      and DBP), and change in BP from baseline to the final follow-up. Individual patient 
      data on age, sex, medication use, diabetes mellitus, baseline and follow-up BP, and 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were requested from the authors of the included studies. 
      For trial-level data, between-group differences in BP change were combined in a 
      random-effects model. For individual patient data, between-group differences in BP 
      at the final follow up, adjusted for baseline BP, were calculated before combining 
      in a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Difference in SBP and DBP 
      measured in an office setting. RESULTS: We included 46 trials (4541 participants) in 
      the trial-level meta-analysis. Individual patient data were obtained for 27 trials 
      (3092 participants). At the trial level, no effect of vitamin D supplementation was 
      seen on SBP (effect size, 0.0 [95% CI, -0.8 to 0.8] mm Hg; P=.97; I2=21%) or DBP 
      (effect size, -0.1 [95% CI, -0.6 to 0.5] mm Hg; P=.84; I2=20%). Similar results were 
      found analyzing individual patient data for SBP (effect size, -0.5 [95% CI, -1.3 to 
      0.4] mm Hg; P=.27; I2=0%) and DBP (effect size, 0.2 [95% CI, -0.3 to 0.7] mm Hg; 
      P=.38; I2=0%). Subgroup analysis did not reveal any baseline factor predictive of a 
      better response to therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vitamin D supplementation is 
      ineffective as an agent for lowering BP and thus should not be used as an 
      antihypertensive agent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Results from studies evaluating the effectiveness of focused 
      psychosocial support interventions in children exposed to traumatic events in 
      humanitarian settings in low-income and middle-income countries have been 
      inconsistent, showing varying results by setting and subgroup (eg, age or gender). 
      We aimed to assess the effectiveness of these interventions, and to explore which 
      children are likely to benefit most. METHODS: We did a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) from 3143 children recruited to 
      11 randomised controlled trials of focused psychosocial support interventions versus 
      waiting list. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
      MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycArticles, Web of Science, and the main local low-income and 
      middle-income countries (LMICs) databases according to the list of databases 
      relevant to LMIC developed collaboratively by Cochrane and WHO Library, up to 
      November, 2016. We included randomised controlled trials that assessed the 
      effectiveness of focused psychosocial support interventions in children exposed to 
      traumatic events in LMICs, compared with waiting lists (eg, inactive controls). We 
      excluded quasi-randomised trials, studies that did not focus on psychosocial support 
      interventions, and studies that compared two active interventions without control 
      conditions. We requested anonymised data from each trial for each of the 
      prespecified variables for each child who was randomly assigned. The main outcomes 
      considered were continuous scores in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, 
      depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms assessed with rating scales administered 
      immediately (0-4 weeks) after the intervention. We harmonised all individual items 
      from rating scales using item response theory methods. This study is registered with 
      PROSPERO, number CRD42013006960. FINDINGS: We identified a beneficial effect of 
      focused psychosocial support interventions on PTSD symptoms (standardised mean 
      difference [SMD] -0·33, 95% CI -0·52 to -0·14) that was maintained at follow-up 
      (-0·21, -0·42 to -0·01). We also identified benefits at the endpoint for functional 
      impairment (-0·29, -0·43 to -0·15) and for strengths: coping (-0·22, -0·43 to 
      -0·02), hope (-0·29, -0·48 to -0·09), and social support (-0·27, -0·52 to -0·02). In 
      IPD meta-analyses focused on age, gender, displacement status, region, and household 
      size we found a stronger improvement in PTSD symptoms in children aged 15-18 years 
      (-0·43, -0·63 to -0·23), in non-displaced children (-0·40, -0·52 to -0·27), and in 
      children living in smaller households (<6 members; -0·27, -0·42 to -0·11). 
      INTERPRETATION: Overall, focused psychosocial interventions are effective in 
      reducing PTSD and functional impairment, and in increasing hope, coping, and social 
      support. Future studies should focus on strengthening interventions for younger 
      children, displaced children, and children living in larger households. FUNDING:

TI  - Antiplatelet therapy before or after 16 weeks' gestation for preventing 
      preeclampsia: an individual participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - 121-128.e2
LID - S0002-9378(16)30911-5 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimum time for commencing antiplatelet therapy for the prevention 
      of preeclampsia and its complications is unclear. Aggregate data meta-analyses 
      suggest that aspirin is more effective if given prior to 16 weeks' gestation, but 
      data are limited because of an inability to place women in the correct gestational 
      age subgroup from relevant trials. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to use 
      the large existing individual participant data set from the Perinatal Antiplatelet 
      Review of International Studies Collaboration to assess whether the treatment 
      effects of antiplatelet agents on preeclampsia and its complications vary based on 
      whether treatment is started before or after 16 weeks' gestation. STUDY DESIGN: A 
      meta-analysis of individual participant data including 32,217 women and 32,819 
      babies recruited to 31 randomized trials comparing low-dose aspirin or other 
      antiplatelet agents with placebo or no treatment for the prevention of preeclampsia 
      has been published previously. Using this existing data set, we performed a 
      prespecified subgroup analysis based on gestation at randomization to antiplatelet 
      agents before 16 weeks, compared with at or after 16 weeks, for 4 of the main 
      outcomes prespecified in the Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies 
      protocol: preeclampsia, death of baby, preterm birth before 34 weeks, and 
      small-for-gestational-age baby. Individual participant data for the subgroups were 
      combined in a meta-analysis using RevMan software. Heterogeneity was assessed with 
      the I(2) statistic. The χ(2) test for interaction was used to assess statistically 
      significant (P < .05) differences in treatment effect between subgroups. RESULTS: 
      There was no significant difference in the effects of antiplatelet therapy for women 
      randomized before 16 weeks' gestation compared with those randomized at or after 16 
      weeks for any of the 4 prespecified outcomes: preeclampsia, relative risk, 0.90, 
      (95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.03; 17 trials, 9241 women) for <16 weeks and 
      relative risk, 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.98; 22 trials, 21,429 women) 
      for ≥16 weeks (interaction test, P = .98); death of baby, relative risk, 0.89 (95% 
      confidence interval, 0.73-1.09; 15 trials, 8626 women) for <16 weeks and relative 
      risk, 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.07; 21 trials, 22,336 women) for ≥16 
      weeks (interaction test, P = .80); preterm birth prior to 34 weeks, relative risk, 
      0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.04; 19 trials, 9155 women) for <16 weeks and 
      relative risk, 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.00; 25 trials, 22,117 women) 
      for ≥16 weeks (interaction test, P = .91); and small-for-gestational-age baby, 
      relative risk, 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.94; 13 trials, 6393 women) for 
      <16 weeks and relative risk, 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.08; 18 trials, 
      14,996 women) for ≥16 weeks (interaction test, P = .08). CONCLUSION: The effect of 
      low-dose aspirin and other antiplatelet agents on preeclampsia and its complications 
      is consistent, regardless of whether treatment is started before or after 16 weeks' 
      gestation. Women at an increased risk of preeclampsia should be offered antiplatelet 
      therapy, regardless of whether they are first seen before or after 16 weeks' 
      gestation.

AB  - The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the cardioprotective benefit of β 
      blockers in preventing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) in breast cancer 
      patients. Anthracyclines are the cornerstone treatment for breast cancer. Yet, their 
      use has declined in the last decade due to associated AIC. Although β blockers may 
      protect left ventricular (LV) function, previous trials were underpowered with 
      equivocal results. The authors systematically searched online databases through 
      August 2018 for studies evaluating effectiveness of β blockers in preventing AIC in 
      breast cancer patients. We analyzed 9 studies including 771 patients. Data on 
      converting-enzyme inhibitors, trastuzumab, or other malignancies were excluded. The 
      primary outcome was comparison of postchemotherapy LV ejection fraction (LVEF) 
      between β blocker and placebo. Secondary outcomes were changes in global 
      longitudinal strain, LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and diastolic function 
      parameters, as assessed by 2D echocardiogram and MRI. The mean pre-chemotherapy LVEF 
      was >60% in all studies. Our pooled analysis demonstrated significantly higher LVEF 
      postchemotherapy in the β blocker group in comparison to placebo: mean difference 
      -3.84 with 95% confidence interval [-(6.19 to 1.48) p = 0.001]. The absolute change 
      in EF also favored β blockers: mean difference -3.66 with 95% confidence interval 
      [-(6.20 to 1.12) p = 0.005]. Diastolic function, global longitudinal strain, and 
      LVEDD were also preserved by β blockers, but only LVEDD reached statistical 
      significance. In conclusion, this study suggests that β blockers during 
      anthracycline chemotherapy may prevent cardiotoxicity by preserving LV function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous clinical trials have addressed that rivaroxaban is effective 
      for the treatment of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). This study will 
      systematically assess its efficacy and safety for PE. METHODS: We will carry out 
      this study by searching the following electronic databases from inception to March 
      1, 2019 without language restrictions: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PUBMED, Web of 
      Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and 
      Complementary Medicine Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and China 
      National Knowledge Infrastructure. In addition, we will also search clinical trial 
      registries, dissertations, and conference abstracts to avoid any missing potential 
      studies. All randomized controlled trials of rivaroxaban for patients with PE will 
      be fully considered. Two researchers will independently perform literature 
      selection, data collection, and methodological quality assessment. If it is 
      appropriate, outcome data will be pooled by using a fixed-effect model or 
      random-effect model, and meta-analysis will be considered for operation. RESULTS: 
      All efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for PE will be assessed through all primary 
      and secondary outcomes. The primary outcomes are all-cause mortality and major 
      bleeding. The secondary outcomes are recurrent venous thromboembolism, duration of 
      hospital stay, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and adverse events. 
      CONCLUSION: The findings of this study will summarize updated evidence on the 
      efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for patients with PE. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      It is not necessary to inquire ethical approval for this study, because it will not 
      analyze any individual patient data. The results of this study will be published 
      through peer-reviewed journals. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO

TI  - Effects of repeat prenatal corticosteroids given to women at risk of preterm birth: 
      An individual participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - e1002771

LID - e1002771
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants born preterm compared with infants born at term are at an 
      increased risk of dying and of serious morbidities in early life, and those who 
      survive have higher rates of neurological impairments. It remains unclear whether 
      exposure to repeat courses of prenatal corticosteroids can reduce these risks. This 
      individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis (MA) assessed whether repeat 
      prenatal corticosteroid treatment given to women at ongoing risk of preterm birth in 
      order to benefit their infants is modified by participant or treatment factors. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Trials were eligible for inclusion if they randomised women 
      considered at risk of preterm birth who had already received an initial, single 
      course of prenatal corticosteroid seven or more days previously and in which 
      corticosteroids were compared with either placebo or no placebo. The primary 
      outcomes for the infants were serious outcome, use of respiratory support, and birth 
      weight z-scores; for the children, they were death or any neurosensory disability; 
      and for the women, maternal sepsis. Studies were identified using the Cochrane 
      Pregnancy and Childbirth search strategy. Date of last search was 20 January 2015. 
      IPD were sought from investigators with eligible trials. Risk of bias was assessed 
      using criteria from the Cochrane Collaboration. IPD were analysed using a one-stage 
      approach. Eleven trials, conducted between 2002 and 2010, were identified as 
      eligible, with five trials being from the United States, two from Canada, and one 
      each from Australia and New Zealand, Finland, India, and the United Kingdom. All 11 
      trials were included, with 4,857 women and 5,915 infants contributing data. The mean 
      gestational age at trial entry for the trials was between 27.4 weeks and 30.2 weeks. 
      There was no significant difference in the proportion of infants with a serious 
      outcome (relative risk [RR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.04, 5,893 
      infants, 11 trials, p = 0.33 for heterogeneity). There was a reduction in the use of 
      respiratory support in infants exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids compared 
      with infants not exposed (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97, 5,791 infants, 10 trials, p 
      = 0.64 for heterogeneity). The number needed to treat (NNT) to benefit was 21 (95% 
      CI 14 to 41) women/fetus to prevent one infant from needing respiratory support. 
      Birth weight z-scores were lower in the repeat corticosteroid group (mean difference 
      -0.12, 95%CI -0.18 to -0.06, 5,902 infants, 11 trials, p = 0.80 for heterogeneity). 
      No statistically significant differences were seen for any of the primary outcomes 
      for the child (death or any neurosensory disability) or for the woman (maternal 
      sepsis). The treatment effect varied little by reason the woman was considered to be 
      at risk of preterm birth, the number of fetuses in utero, the gestational age when 
      first trial treatment course was given, or the time prior to birth that the last 
      dose was given. Infants exposed to between 2-5 courses of repeat corticosteroids 
      showed a reduction in both serious outcome and the use of respiratory support 
      compared with infants exposed to only a single repeat course. However, increasing 
      numbers of repeat courses of corticosteroids were associated with larger reductions 
      in birth z-scores for weight, length, and head circumference. Not all trials could 
      provide data for all of the prespecified subgroups, so this limited the power to 
      detect differences because event rates are low for some important maternal, infant, 
      and childhood outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that repeat prenatal 
      corticosteroids given to women at ongoing risk of preterm birth after an initial 
      course reduced the likelihood of their infant needing respiratory support after 
      birth and led to neonatal benefits. Body size measures at birth were lower in 
      infants exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids. Our findings suggest that to 
      provide clinical benefit with the least effect on growth, the number of repeat 
      treatment courses should be limited to a maximum of three and the total dose to 
      between 24 mg and 48 mg.

TI  - Prevalence of sexually transmitted infections and bacterial vaginosis among women in 
      sub-Saharan Africa: An individual participant data meta-analysis of 18 HIV 
      prevention studies.
PG  - e1002511

AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimates of sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence are 
      essential for efforts to prevent and control STIs. Few large STI prevalence studies 
      exist, especially for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Our primary 
      objective was to estimate the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, 
      syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and bacterial vaginosis (BV) among 
      women in sub-Saharan Africa by age, region, and population type. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: We analyzed individual-level data from 18 HIV prevention studies (cohort 
      studies and randomized controlled trials; conducted during 1993-2011), representing 
      >37,000 women, that tested participants for ≥1 selected STIs or BV at baseline. We 
      used a 2-stage meta-analysis to combine data. After calculating the proportion of 
      participants with each infection and standard error by study, we used a 
      random-effects model to obtain a summary mean prevalence of each infection and 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) across ages, regions, and population types. Despite 
      substantial study heterogeneity for some STIs/populations, several patterns emerged. 
      Across the three primary region/population groups (South Africa community-based, 
      Southern/Eastern Africa community-based, and Eastern Africa higher-risk), prevalence 
      was higher among 15-24-year-old than 25-49-year-old women for all STIs except HSV-2. 
      In general, higher-risk populations had greater prevalence of gonorrhea and syphilis 
      than clinic/community-based populations. For chlamydia, prevalence among 
      15-24-year-olds was 10.3% (95% CI: 7.4%, 14.1%; I2 = 75.7%) among women specifically 
      recruited from higher-risk settings for HIV in Eastern Africa and was 15.1% (95% CI: 
      12.7%, 17.8%; I2 = 82.3%) in South African clinic/community-based populations. Among 
      clinic/community-based populations, prevalence was generally greater in South Africa 
      than in Southern/Eastern Africa for most STIs; for gonorrhea, prevalence among 
      15-24-year-olds was 4.6% (95% CI: 3.3%, 6.4%; I2 = 82.8%) in South Africa and was 
      1.7% (95% CI: 1.2%, 2.6%; I2 = 55.2%) in Southern/Eastern Africa. Across the three 
      primary region/population groups, HSV-2 and BV prevalence was high among 
      25-49-year-olds (ranging from 70% to 83% and 33% to 44%, respectively). The main 
      study limitation is that the data are not from random samples of the target 
      populations. CONCLUSIONS: Combining data from 18 HIV prevention studies, our 
      findings highlight important features of STI/BV epidemiology among sub-Saharan 
      African women. This methodology can be used where routine STI surveillance is 
      limited and offers a new approach to obtaining critical information on STI and BV 
      prevalence in LMICs.

TI  - Overall Survival of Black and White Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant 
      Prostate Cancer Treated With Docetaxel.
PG  - 403-410
LID - 10.1200/JCO.18.01279 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Several studies have reported that among patients with localized prostate 
      cancer, black men have a shorter overall survival (OS) time than white men, but few 
      data exist for men with advanced prostate cancer. The primary goal of this analysis 
      was to compare the OS in black and white men with metastatic castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) who were treated in phase III clinical trials with docetaxel 
      plus prednisone (DP) or a DP-containing regimen. METHODS: Individual participant 
      data from 8,820 men with mCRPC randomly assigned in nine phase III trials to DP or a 
      DP-containing regimen were combined. Race was based on self-report. The primary end 
      point was OS. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the 
      prognostic importance of race (black v white) adjusted for established risk factors 
      common across the trials (age, prostate-specific antigen, performance status, 
      alkaline phosphatase, hemoglobin, and sites of metastases). RESULTS: Of 8,820 men, 
      7,528 (85%) were white, 500 (6%) were black, 424 (5%) were Asian, and 368 (4%) were 
      of unknown race. Black men were younger and had worse performance status, higher 
      testosterone and prostate-specific antigen, and lower hemoglobin than white men. 
      Despite these differences, the median OS was 21.0 months (95% CI, 19.4 to 22.5 
      months) versus 21.2 months (95% CI, 20.8 to 21.7 months) in black and white men, 
      respectively. The pooled multivariable hazard ratio of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.91) 
      demonstrates that overall, black men have a statistically significant decreased risk 
      of death compared with white men ( P < .001). CONCLUSION: When adjusted for known 
      prognostic factors, we observed a statistically significant increased OS in black 
      versus white men with mCRPC who were enrolled in these clinical trials. The 
      mechanism for these differences is not known.

TI  - Stratifying risk in the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage: Results of an 
      individual patient meta-analysis.
PG  - 1219-1231
LID - 10.1002/hep.29267 [doi]
AB  - Endoscopic variceal ligation plus beta-blockers (EVL+BB) is currently recommended 
      for variceal rebleeding prophylaxis, a recommendation that extends to all patients 
      with cirrhosis with previous variceal bleeding irrespective of prognostic stage. 
      Individualizing patient care is relevant, and in published studies on variceal 
      rebleeding prophylaxis, there is a lack of information regarding response to therapy 
      by prognostic stage. This study aimed at comparing EVL plus BB with monotherapy (EVL 
      or BB) on all-source rebleeding and mortality in patients with cirrhosis and 
      previous variceal bleeding stratified by cirrhosis severity (Child A versus B/C) by 
      means of individual time-to-event patient data meta-analysis from randomized 
      controlled trials. The study used individual data on 389 patients from three trials 
      comparing EVL plus BB versus BB and 416 patients from four trials comparing EVL plus 
      BB versus EVL. Compared with BB alone, EVL plus BB reduced overall rebleeding in 
      Child A (incidence rate ratio 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.89; P = 0.025) 
      but not in Child B/C, without differences in mortality. The effect of EVL on 
      rebleeding was different according to Child (P for interaction <0.001). Conversely, 
      compared with EVL, EVL plus BB reduced rebleeding in both Child A and B/C, with a 
      significant reduction in mortality in Child B/C (incidence rate ratio 0.46; 95% 
      confidence interval, 0.25-0.85; P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: Outcomes of therapies to 
      prevent variceal rebleeding differ depending on cirrhosis severity: in patients with 
      preserved liver function (Child A), combination therapy is recommended because it is 
      more effective in preventing rebleeding, without modifying survival, while in 
      patients with advanced liver failure (Child B/C), EVL alone carries an increased 
      risk of rebleeding and death compared with combination therapy, underlining that BB 
      is the key element of combination therapy. (Hepatology 2017;66:1219-1231).

TI  - Antiplatelet Agents and the Prevention of Spontaneous Preterm Birth: A Systematic 
      Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 327-336
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000001848 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous preterm birth is an important cause of neonatal mortality and 
      morbidity. An increasing body of evidence suggests that uteroplacental ischemia 
      plays an important role in the etiology of spontaneous preterm birth. We aimed to 
      study whether antiplatelet agents reduce the risk of spontaneous preterm birth. DATA 
      SOURCES: We included data from an individual participant data meta-analysis of 
      studies that had evaluated the effect of antiplatelet agents to reduce preeclampsia 
      (Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies Individual Participant 
      Data). METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: The meta-analysis included 31 studies that 
      randomized women to low-dose aspirin-dipyridamole or placebo-no treatment as a 
      primary preventive strategy for preeclampsia. For the current study we analyzed data 
      from 17 trials (28,797 women) that supplied data on type of delivery (spontaneous 
      compared with indicated birth). TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Primary 
      endpoints were spontaneous preterm birth at less than 37 weeks, less than 34 weeks, 
      and less than 28 weeks of gestation. We analyzed outcomes for each trial separately 
      using χ statistics and combined in an individual participant data meta-analysis 
      using a binary logistic regression model. Women assigned to antiplatelet treatment 
      compared with placebo or no treatment had a lower risk of spontaneous preterm birth 
      at less than 37 weeks (relative risk [RR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.86-0.996) and less than 34 weeks of gestation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.99). The RR 
      of having a spontaneous preterm birth at less than 37 weeks of gestation was 0.83 
      (95% CI 0.73-0.95) for women who have had a previous pregnancy and 0.98 (95% CI 
      0.89-1.09) for women in their first pregnancy. The treatment effect was stable in 
      all other prespecified subgroups. CONCLUSION: Antiplatelet agents reduce spontaneous 
      preterm birth in pregnant women at risk for preeclampsia.

      compared SSNB with physical therapy, placebo, and intra-articular injections were 
      included, comprising 591 patients. DATA EXTRACTION: Patient demographics, regimens 
      for SSNB and intra-articular injections, use of fluoroscopy or ultrasound guidance, 
      conjunction with physical therapy, methods of randomization, and measurements of 
      functional change and pain improvement were retrieved. The standardized mean 
      differences (SMDs) of pain relief and functional improvement were calculated 1, 4, 
      and 12 weeks after intervention. DATA SYNTHESIS: Regarding pain relief, SSNB 
      provided better pain relief for 12 weeks compared with physical therapy (SMD=.75; 
      95% confidence interval [CI], .35-1.14) and placebo injections (SMD=.70; 95% CI, 
      .40-1.00), but was not superior to intra-articular injections. Differences in 
      patient populations and use of pulsed radiofrequency did not cause a significant 
      variation in therapeutic efficacy, but guidance using ultrasound showed consistently 
      better effectiveness than guidance using surface landmarks and fluoroscopy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrated the superiority of SSNB to placebo and 
      physical therapy and a similar efficacy of SSNB compared with intra-articular 
      injection for treatment of chronic shoulder pain. Ultrasound was the most preferable 
      guidance tool, and future studies are advised to integrate physical therapy in order 
      to improve the long-term effectiveness of SSNB.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of co-administered ivermectin plus albendazole for treating 
      soil-transmitted helminths: A systematic review, meta-analysis and individual 
      patient data analysis.
PG  - e0006458
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006458 [doi]
LID - e0006458
AB  - BACKGROUND: The soil-transmitted helminths (STH), Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris 
      trichiura and hookworms, infect 1.5 billion people worldwide and cause an estimated 
      burden of 3.3 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Current control 
      strategies focus on morbidity reduction through preventive chemotherapy (PC) but the 
      most commonly used recommended drugs (albendazole and mebendazole) are particularly 
      inefficacious against T. trichiura. This, together with the threat of emerging drug 
      resistance, calls for new control strategies, including co-administration with other 
      anthelminthics. Ivermectin plus albendazole is widely used against lymphatic 
      filariasis, but its efficacy and safety against STH infections has not yet been 
      fully understood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic literature review 
      and meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of ivermectin-albendazole 
      co-administration in five different databases (i.e. PubMed, ISI Web of Science, 
      ScienceDirect, CENTRAL and clinicaltrials.gov) from 1960 to January 2018. Four 
      studies reporting efficacy of ivermectin-albendazole against STH infections and five 
      studies on its safety met the selection criteria and were included for quantitative 
      analysis. Ivermectin-albendazole was significantly associated with lower risk (risk 
      ratio (RR) = 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.31-0.62) for T. trichiura 
      infection after treatment compared to albendazole alone. The co-administration 
      revealed no or only a marginal benefit on cure and egg reduction rates over 
      albendazole alone for A. lumbricoides and hookworm infections. Adverse events (AEs) 
      occurring after ivermectin-albendazole co-administration were mostly mild and 
      transient. Overall, the number of individuals reporting any AE was not different (RR 
      = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.87-1.36) in co-treated and albendazole-treated patients. However, 
      although not statistically significant, sub-group analysis showed a tendency for 
      slightly more AEs in patients with filariasis treated with ivermectin-albendazole 
      compared to those treated with albendazole alone (RR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.81-2.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a good tolerability and higher efficacy of 
      ivermectin-albendazole against T. trichiura compared to the current standard 
      single-dose albendazole treatment, which supports the use of this co-administration 
      in PC programs. Large-scale definitive randomized controlled trials are required to 
      confirm our results.

AB  - Recommendations for the analysis of competing risks in the context of randomized 
      clinical trials are well established. Meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) 
      is the gold standard for synthesizing evidence for clinical interpretation based on 
      multiple studies. Surprisingly, no formal guidelines have been yet proposed to 
      conduct an IPD meta-analysis with competing risk endpoints. To fill this gap, this 
      work details (i) how to handle the heterogeneity between trials via a stratified 
      regression model for competing risks and (ii) that the usual metrics of 
      inconsistency to assess heterogeneity can readily be employed. Our proposal is 
      illustrated by the re-analysis of a recently published meta-analysis in 
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma, aiming at quantifying the benefit of the addition of 
      chemotherapy to radiotherapy on each competing endpoint.

TI  - The interaction of sex, height, and QRS duration on the effects of cardiac 
      resynchronization therapy on morbidity and mortality: an individual-patient data 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 780-791
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.1133 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To explore possible associations that may explain the greater benefit from 
      cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) reported amongst women. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      In an individual-patient data meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials, 
      all-cause mortality and the composite of all-cause mortality or first 
      hospitalization for heart failure (HF) were compared among 794 women and 2702 men 
      assigned to CRT or a control group. Multivariable analyses were performed to assess 
      the impact of sex, QRS duration, HF aetiology, left ventricular end-diastolic 
      diameter (LVEDD), and height on outcome. Women were shorter, had smaller LVEDD, more 
      often left bundle branch block, and less often ischaemic heart disease, but QRS 
      duration was similar between sexes. Women tended to obtain greater benefit from CRT 
      but sex was not an independent predictor of either outcome. For all-cause mortality, 
      QRS duration was the only independent predictor of CRT benefit. For the composite 
      outcome, height and QRS duration, but not sex, were independent predictors of CRT 
      benefit. Further analysis suggested increasing benefit with increasing QRS duration 
      amongst shorter patients, of whom a great proportion were women. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this individual-patient data meta-analysis, CRT benefit was greater in shorter 
      patients, which may explain reports of enhanced CRT benefit among women. Further 
      analyses are required to determine whether recommendations on the QRS threshold for 
      CRT should be adjusted for height. (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers: NCT00170300, 
      NCT00271154, NCT00251251).

TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil versus ceftriaxone for the treatment of community-acquired 
      pneumonia: individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 862-70
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkv415 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials of adults hospitalized 
      with pneumonia outcomes research team (PORT) risk class 3-4 community-acquired 
      pneumonia (CAP) receiving ceftaroline fosamil versus ceftriaxone. METHODS: Three 
      Phase III trials (clinicaltrials.gov registration numbers NCT00621504, NCT00509106 
      and NCT01371838) including 1916 hospitalized patients with CAP randomized 1:1 to 
      empirical ceftaroline fosamil (600 mg every 12 h) or ceftriaxone (1-2 g every 24 h) 
      for 5-7 days were included in the meta-analysis. Primary outcome was clinical 
      response at the test-of-cure visit (8-15 days after end of treatment) in the PORT 
      risk class 3-4 modified ITT (MITT) and clinically evaluable (CE) populations. Data 
      were tested for heterogeneity (χ(2) test) and, if not significant, results were 
      pooled and OR and 95% CI constructed. A logistic regression analysis assessed 
      factors impacting cure rate and treatment interactions. RESULTS: Clinical cure rates 
      in each trial consistently favoured ceftaroline fosamil versus ceftriaxone, with no 
      evidence of heterogeneity. In the meta-analysis, ceftaroline fosamil was superior to 
      ceftriaxone in the MITT (OR: 1.66; 95% CI 1.34, 2.06; P < 0.001) and CE (OR: 1.65; 
      95% CI 1.26, 2.16; P < 0.001) populations. Results were consistent across various 
      patient- and disease-related factors including patients' age and PORT score. Prior 
      antimicrobial use within 96 h of starting study treatment was associated with 
      diminished differences in cure rates between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline 
      fosamil was superior to ceftriaxone for empirical treatment of adults hospitalized 
      with CAP. Receipt of prior antimicrobial therapy appeared to diminish the observed 
      treatment effect.

TI  - Does Internet-based guided-self-help for depression cause harm? An individual 
      participant data meta-analysis on deterioration rates and its moderators in 
      randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 2679-93
LID - 10.1017/S0033291716001562 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Almost nothing is known about the potential negative effects of 
      Internet-based psychological treatments for depression. This study aims at 
      investigating deterioration and its moderators within randomized trials on 
      Internet-based guided self-help for adult depression, using an individual patient 
      data meta-analyses (IPDMA) approach. METHOD: Studies were identified through 
      systematic searches (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library). Deterioration in 
      participants was defined as a significant symptom increase according to the reliable 
      change index (i.e. 7.68 points in the CES-D; 7.63 points in the BDI). Two-step IPDMA 
      procedures, with a random-effects model were used to pool data. RESULTS: A total of 
      18 studies (21 comparisons, 2079 participants) contributed data to the analysis. The 
      risk for a reliable deterioration from baseline to post-treatment was significantly 
      lower in the intervention v. control conditions (3.36 v. 7.60; relative risk 0.47, 
      95% confidence interval 0.29-0.75). Education moderated effects on deterioration, 
      with patients with low education displaying a higher risk for deterioration than 
      patients with higher education. Deterioration rates for patients with low education 
      did not differ statistically significantly between intervention and control groups. 
      The benefit-risk ratio for patients with low education indicated that 9.38 patients 
      achieve a treatment response for each patient experiencing a symptom deterioration. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Internet-based guided self-help is associated with a mean reduced risk 
      for a symptom deterioration compared to controls. Treatment and symptom progress of 
      patients with low education should be closely monitored, as some patients might face 
      an increased risk for symptom deterioration. Future studies should examine 
      predictors of deterioration in patients with low education.

TI  - Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in the era of individual patient data 
      sharing.
PG  - 403-409
LID - 10.1007/s10147-018-1237-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis is considered to be a gold 
      standard when the results of several randomized trials are combined. Recent 
      initiatives on sharing IPD from clinical trials offer unprecedented opportunities 
      for using such data in IPD meta-analyses. METHODS: First, we discuss the evidence 
      generated and the benefits obtained by a long-established prospective IPD 
      meta-analysis in early breast cancer. Next, we discuss a data-sharing system that 
      has been adopted by several pharmaceutical sponsors. We review a number of 
      retrospective IPD meta-analyses that have already been proposed using this 
      data-sharing system. Finally, we discuss the role of data sharing in IPD 
      meta-analysis in the future. RESULTS: Treatment effects can be more reliably 
      estimated in both types of IPD meta-analyses than with summary statistics extracted 
      from published papers. Specifically, with rich covariate information available on 
      each patient, prognostic and predictive factors can be identified or confirmed. 
      Also, when several endpoints are available, surrogate endpoints can be assessed 
      statistically. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are difficulties in conducting, 
      analyzing, and interpreting retrospective IPD meta-analysis utilizing the currently 
      available data-sharing systems, data sharing will play an important role in IPD 
      meta-analysis in the future.

TI  - Prioritization and Timing of Outcomes and Endpoints After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid 
      Hemorrhage in Clinical Trials and Observational Studies: Proposal of a 
      Multidisciplinary Research Group.
PG  - 102-113
LID - 10.1007/s12028-019-00737-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In studies on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), substantial 
      variability exists in the use and timing of outcomes and endpoints, which 
      complicates interpretation and comparison of results between studies. The aim of the 
      National Institute of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and 
      Stroke/National Library of Medicine Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysm (UIA) and SAH 
      common data elements (CDE) Project was to provide a common structure for future UIA 
      and SAH research. METHODS: This article summarizes the recommendations of the UIA 
      and SAH CDE Outcomes and Endpoints subgroup, which consisted of an international and 
      multidisciplinary ad hoc panel of experts in clinical outcomes after SAH. Consensus 
      recommendations were developed by review of previously published CDEs for other 
      neurological diseases and the SAH literature. Recommendations for CDEs were 
      classified by priority into "Core," "Supplemental-Highly Recommended," 
      "Supplemental," and "Exploratory." RESULTS: The subgroup identified over 50 outcomes 
      measures and template case report forms (CRFs) to be included as part of the UIA and 
      SAH CDE recommendations. None was classified as "Core". The modified Rankin Scale 
      score and Montreal Cognitive Assessment were considered the preferred outcomes and 
      classified as Supplemental-Highly Recommended. Death, Glasgow Outcome Scale score, 
      and Glasgow Outcome Scale-extended were classified as Supplemental. All other 
      outcome measures were categorized as "Exploratory". We propose outcome assessment at 
      3 months and at 12 months for studies interested in long-term outcomes. We give 
      recommendations for standardized dichotomization. CONCLUSION: The recommended 
      outcome measures and CRFs have been distilled from a broad pool of potentially 
      useful CDEs, scales, instruments, and endpoints. The adherence to these 
      recommendations will facilitate the comparison of results across studies and 
      meta-analyses of individual patient data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No evidence exists to recommend a specific chemotherapy regimen in young 
      breast cancer patients. We performed a pooled analysis of two randomised clinical 
      trials to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy in premenopausal 
      breast cancer patients and its impact on the risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the MIG1 study, node-positive or high-risk node-negative 
      patients were randomised to 6 cycles of 
      fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 (dose-dense) or 3 
      (standard-interval) weeks. In the GIM2 study, node-positive patients were randomised 
      to 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval EC or FEC followed by 4 cycles of 
      dose-dense or standard-interval paclitaxel. Using individual patient data, the 
      hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival by means of a Cox proportional hazards model 
      and the odds ratio for treatment-induced amenorrhoea through a logistic regression 
      model were calculated for each study. A meta-analysis of the two studies was 
      performed using the random effect model to compute the parameter estimates. RESULTS: 
      A total of 1,549 patients were included. Dose-dense chemotherapy was associated with 
      a significant improved overall survival as compared to standard-interval 
      chemotherapy (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.54-0.95; p = 0.021). The 
      pooled HRs were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.12) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.06) for patients 
      with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumours, respectively (interaction 
      p = 0.330). No increased risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea was observed with 
      dose-dense chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.25; p = 0.989). 
      CONCLUSION: Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered the preferred 
      treatment option in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients.

TI  - Duration of the common cold and similar continuous outcomes should be analyzed on 
      the relative scale: a case study of two zinc lozenge trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative scale has been used for decades in analysing binary data in 
      epidemiology. In contrast, there has been a long tradition of carrying out 
      meta-analyses of continuous outcomes on the absolute, original measurement, scale. 
      The biological rationale for using the relative scale in the analysis of binary 
      outcomes is that it adjusts for baseline variations; however, similar baseline 
      variations can occur in continuous outcomes and relative effect scale may therefore 
      be often useful also for continuous outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine 
      whether the relative scale is more consistent with empirical data on treating the 
      common cold than the absolute scale. METHODS: Individual patient data was available 
      for 2 randomized trials on zinc lozenges for the treatment of the common cold. 
      Mossad (Ann Intern Med 125:81-8, 1996) found 4.0 days and 43% reduction, and Petrus 
      (Curr Ther Res 59:595-607, 1998) found 1.77 days and 25% reduction, in the duration 
      of colds. In both trials, variance in the placebo group was significantly greater 
      than in the zinc lozenge group. The effect estimates were applied to the common cold 
      distributions of the placebo groups, and the resulting distributions were compared 
      with the actual zinc lozenge group distributions. RESULTS: When the absolute effect 
      estimates, 4.0 and 1.77 days, were applied to the placebo group common cold 
      distributions, negative and zero (i.e., impossible) cold durations were predicted, 
      and the high level variance remained. In contrast, when the relative effect 
      estimates, 43 and 25%, were applied, impossible common cold durations were not 
      predicted in the placebo groups, and the cold distributions became similar to those 
      of the zinc lozenge groups. CONCLUSIONS: For some continuous outcomes, such as the 
      duration of illness and the duration of hospital stay, the relative scale leads to a 
      more informative statistical analysis and more effective communication of the study 
      findings. The transformation of continuous data to the relative scale is simple with 
      a spreadsheet program, after which the relative scale data can be analysed using 
      standard meta-analysis software. The option for the analysis of relative effects of 
      continuous outcomes directly from the original data should be implemented in 
      standard meta-analysis programs.

TI  - Sex differences in treatment and outcome after stroke: Pooled analysis including 
      19,000 participants.
PG  - e2170-e2180
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000008615 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the sex differences in outcomes and management after stroke 
      using a large sample with high-quality international trial data. METHODS: Individual 
      participant data were obtained from 5 acute stroke randomized controlled trials. 
      Data were obtained on demographics, medication use, in-hospital treatment, and 
      functional outcome. Study-specific crude and adjusted models were used to estimate 
      sex differences in outcomes and management, and then pooled using random-effects 
      meta-analysis. RESULTS: There were 19,652 participants, of whom 7,721 (40%) were 
      women. After multivariable adjustments, women with ischemic stroke had higher 
      survival at 3-6 months (odds ratio [OR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.70-0.97), higher likelihood of disability (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.36), and worse 
      quality of life (weighted mean difference -0.07, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04). For 
      management, women were more likely to be admitted to an acute stroke unit (OR 1.17, 
      95% CI 1.01-1.34), but less likely to be intubated (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.93), 
      treated for fever (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.95), or admitted to an intensive care unit 
      (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.93). For preadmission medications, women had higher odds of 
      being prescribed antihypertensive agents (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13-1.31) and lower odds 
      of being prescribed antiplatelets (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.93), glucose-lowering 
      agents (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.94), or lipid-lowering agents (OR 0.85, 95% CI 
      0.77-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that women who had ischemic stroke 
      had better survival but were also more disabled and had poorer quality of life. 
      Variations in hospital and out-of-hospital management may partly explain the 
      disparities.

AB  - Meta-analyses of randomized trials using individual-participant data, which 
      represent the highest level of evidence for the evaluation of a treatment effect, 
      are now used in different contexts in clinical research. This article aims at 
      reviewing some of these new applications. Meta-analyses are increasingly used in 
      economic evaluation, which implies new measure outcomes of the treatment effect, as 
      well as in biomarkers evaluations thanks to their higher statistical power and the 
      possibility to validate findings on independent data. This article also considers 
      the perspectives opened up by new data sources, such as randomized trials registers, 
      and data sharing policies.

TI  - Anticoagulant vs. antiplatelet therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke and 
      patent foramen ovale: an individual participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - 2381-9
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehv252 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The preferred antithrombotic strategy for secondary prevention in patients 
      with cryptogenic stroke (CS) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) is unknown. We pooled 
      multiple observational studies and used propensity score-based methods to estimate 
      the comparative effectiveness of oral anticoagulation (OAC) compared with 
      antiplatelet therapy (APT). METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual participant data from 12 
      databases of medically treated patients with CS and PFO were analysed with Cox 
      regression models, to estimate database-specific hazard ratios (HRs) comparing OAC 
      with APT, for both the primary composite outcome [recurrent stroke, transient 
      ischaemic attack (TIA), or death] and stroke alone. Propensity scores were applied 
      via inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for confounding. We 
      synthesized database-specific HRs using random-effects meta-analysis models. This 
      analysis included 2385 (OAC = 804 and APT = 1581) patients with 227 composite 
      endpoints (stroke/TIA/death). The difference between OAC and APT was not 
      statistically significant for the primary composite outcome [adjusted HR = 0.76, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.52-1.12] or for the secondary outcome of stroke alone 
      (adjusted HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.44-1.27). Results were consistent in analyses applying 
      alternative weighting schemes, with the exception that OAC had a statistically 
      significant beneficial effect on the composite outcome in analyses standardized to 
      the patient population who actually received APT (adjusted HR = 0.64, 95% CI 
      0.42-0.99). Subgroup analyses did not detect statistically significant heterogeneity 
      of treatment effects across clinically important patient groups. CONCLUSION: We did 
      not find a statistically significant difference comparing OAC with APT; our results 
      justify randomized trials comparing different antithrombotic approaches in these 
      patients.

TI  - STRIDER (Sildenafil TheRapy in dismal prognosis early onset fetal growth 
      restriction): an international consortium of randomised placebo-controlled trials.
PG  - 440
LID - 10.1186/s12884-017-1594-z [doi]
LID - 440
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe, early-onset fetal growth restriction due to placental 
      insufficiency is associated with a high risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity 
      with long-lasting sequelae. Placental insufficiency is the result of abnormal 
      formation and function of the placenta with inadequate remodelling of the maternal 
      spiral arteries. There is currently no effective therapy available. Some evidence 
      suggests sildenafil citrate may improve uteroplacental blood flow, fetal growth, and 
      meaningful infant outcomes. The objective of the Sildenafil TheRapy In Dismal 
      prognosis Early onset fetal growth Restriction (STRIDER) collaboration is to 
      evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil versus placebo in achieving healthy 
      perinatal survival through the conduct of randomised clinical trials and systematic 
      review including individual patient data meta-analysis. METHODS: Five 
      national/bi-national multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trials have been 
      launched. Women with a singleton pregnancy between 18 and 30 weeks with severe fetal 
      growth restriction of likely placental origin, and where the likelihood of perinatal 
      death/severe morbidity is estimated to be significant are included. Participants 
      will receive either sildenafil 25 mg or matching placebo tablets orally three times 
      daily from recruitment to 32 weeks gestation. DISCUSSION: The STRIDER trials were 
      conceived and designed through international collaboration. Although the individual 
      trials have different primary outcomes for reasons of sample size and feasibility, 
      all trials will collect a standard set of outcomes including survival without severe 
      neonatal morbidity at time of hospital discharge. This is a summary of all the 
      STRIDER trial protocols and provides an example of a prospectively planned 
      international clinical research collaboration. All five individual trials will 
      contribute to a pre-planned systematic review of the topic including individual 
      patient data meta-analysis. TRIAL REGISTRATIONS: New Zealand and Australia:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves prognosis of patients with locally 
      advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to identify 
      predictors for postoperative survival following neoadjuvant therapy. These could be 
      useful in deciding about postoperative continuation of chemotherapy. METHODS: This 
      meta-analysis used IPD from RCTs comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with surgery 
      alone for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Trials providing IPD on age, sex, 
      performance status, pT/N stage, resection status, overall and recurrence-free 
      survival were included. Survival was calculated in the entire study population and 
      subgroups stratified by supposed predictors and compared using the log-rank test. 
      Multivariable Cox models were used to identify independent survival predictors. 
      RESULTS: Four RCTs providing IPD from 553 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 
      (y)pT and (y)pN stage and resection status strongly predicted postoperative survival 
      both after neoadjuvant therapy and surgery alone. Patients with R1 resection after 
      neoadjuvant therapy survived longer than those with R1 resection after surgery 
      alone. Patients with stage pN0 after surgery alone had better prognosis than those 
      with ypN0 after neoadjuvant therapy. Patients with stage ypT3/4 after neoadjuvant 
      therapy survived longer than those with stage pT3/4 after surgery alone. 
      Multivariable regression identified resection status and (y)pN stage as predictors 
      of survival in both groups. (y)pT stage predicted survival only after surgery alone. 
      CONCLUSION: After neoadjuvant therapy for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, survival 
      is determined by the same factors as after surgery alone. However, ypT stage is not 
      an independent predictor. These results can facilitate the decision about 
      postoperative continuation of chemotherapy in pretreated patients.

TI  - Efficacy of etoricoxib for ankylosing spondylitis: A protocol for systematic review 
      of randomized controlled trial.
PG  - e15155
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000015155 [doi]
LID - e15155
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous clinical trials have reported that etoricoxib has been utilized 
      to treat ankylosing spondylitis (AS) effectively. However, no study systematically 
      investigated the efficacy and safety of etoricoxib for patients with AS. In this 
      systematic review, we will assess the efficacy and safety of etoricoxib for AS. 
      METHODS: The following electronic databases will be searched from inception to the 
      February 1, 2019: Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
      Allied Health Literature, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese 
      Biomedical Literature Database, and Chinese Scientific Journal Database. This study 
      will include randomized controlled trials that explore the efficacy and safety of 
      etoricoxib for AS. The primary outcome is pain intensity, as measured by any pain 
      scales, such as Numerical Rating Scale. The secondary outcomes consist of AS 
      function, as measured by Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, or other 
      tools; quality of life, as assessed by Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life 
      questionnaire or any other relevant instruments; as well as adverse events. Two 
      authors will independently carry out the study selection, data extraction, and risk 
      of bias assessment. Statistical analysis will be performed by using RevMan 5.3 
      software. RESULTS: This systematic review will provide a detailed summary of present 
      evidence related to the efficacy and safety of etoricoxib for patients with AS. 
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study may provide management guidance for AS treated 
      by etoricoxib. DISSEMINATION AND ETHICS: This systematic review dose not needs 
      ethical approval, because it will not analyze individual patient data. The findings 
      of this study are expected to publish through a peer-reviewed journal. SYSTEMATIC 
      REVIEW REGISTRATION: CRD42019124768.

PG  - 293-309
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1160 [doi]
AB  - Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis is an increasingly used approach for 
      synthesizing and investigating treatment effect estimates. Over the past few years, 
      numerous methods for conducting an IPD meta-analysis (IPD-MA) have been proposed, 
      often making different assumptions and modeling choices while addressing a similar 
      research question. We conducted a literature review to provide an overview of 
      methods for performing an IPD-MA using evidence from clinical trials or 
      non-randomized studies when investigating treatment efficacy. With this review, we 
      aim to assist researchers in choosing the appropriate methods and provide 
      recommendations on their implementation when planning and conducting an IPD-MA.

TI  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 in irritable bowel syndrome: An individual 
      subject meta-analysis.
PG  - 336-344
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v23.i2.336 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To confirm previous conclusions on Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) 
      CNCM I-3856 for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management. METHODS: An individual 
      patient data meta-analysis was performed on two randomized clinical trials studying 
      the effect of S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 supplementation on gastrointestinal (GI) 
      symptoms in IBS subjects. A total of 579 IBS subjects were included. Outcomes were 
      the daily Likert scale scores of abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating [area under 
      the curve (AUC) and weekly means], responder status, and bowel movements (stool 
      frequency and consistency). Statistical analyses were conducted in Intent to Treat 
      (ITT) population, IBS-C subjects and IBS-C subjects with an abdominal 
      pain/discomfort score higher than or equal to 2 at baseline ("IBS-C ≥ 2 
      subpopulation"). RESULTS: S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 significantly improved abdominal 
      pain/discomfort and bloating during the second month of supplementation [AUC 
      (W5-W8)] with improvement up to the minimal clinically relevant threshold of 10%: a 
      12.3% reduction of abdominal pain/discomfort in the ITT population compared to the 
      Placebo group (P = 0.0134) has been observed. In the IBS-C ≥ 2 subpopulation, there 
      were a 13.1% reduction of abdominal pain/discomfort and a 14.9% reduction of 
      bloating compared to the Placebo group (P = 0.0194 and P = 0.0145, respectively). GI 
      symptoms significantly decreased during supplementation but no statistical 
      differences were reported between groups at the end of the supplementation period. 
      Responder status was defined as a subject who experienced a decrease of 1 arbitrary 
      unit (a.u.) or 50% of the abdominal discomfort score from baseline for at least 2 wk 
      out of the last 4 wk of the study. A significant difference between groups was 
      reported in the ITT population, when considering the first definition: subjects in 
      the Active group had 1.510 higher odds to be a responder (reduction of 1 a.u. of 
      abdominal pain/discomfort) compared with subjects in the Placebo group (P = 0.0240). 
      At the end of supplementation period, stool consistency in the Active group of the 
      ITT population was significantly improved and classified as "normal" compared to 
      Placebo (respectively 3.13 ± 1.197 a.u. vs 2.58 ± 1.020 a.u., P = 0.0003). Similar 
      results were seen in the IBS-C ≥ 2 subpopulation (Active group: 3.14 ± 1.219 a.u. vs 
      Placebo group: 2.59 ± 1.017 a.u., P = 0.0009). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis 
      supports previous data linking S. cerevisiae I-3856 and improvement of GI symptoms, 
      in IBS overall population and in the IBS-C and IBS-C ≥ 2 subpopulations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcoholic hepatitis is a form of alcoholic liver disease characterised 
      by steatosis, necroinflammation, fibrosis, and complications to the liver. 
      Typically, alcoholic hepatitis presents in people between 40 and 50 years of age. 
      Alcoholic hepatitis can be resolved if people abstain from drinking, but the risk of 
      death will depend on the severity of the liver damage and abstinence from alcohol. 
      Glucocorticosteroids have been studied extensively in randomised clinical trials to 
      assess their benefits and harms. However, the results have been contradictory. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of glucocorticosteroids in people with 
      alcoholic hepatitis. SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials through electronic 
      searches in Cochrane Hepato-Biliary's (CHB) Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, 
      MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded. We looked for ongoing 
      or unpublished trials in clinical trials registers and pharmaceutical company 
      sources. We also scanned reference lists of the studies retrieved. The last search 
      was 18 January 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials assessing 
      glucocorticosteroids versus placebo or no intervention in people with alcoholic 
      hepatitis, irrespective of year, language of publication, or format. We considered 
      trials with adults diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, which could have been 
      established through clinical or biochemical diagnostic criteria or both. We defined 
      alcoholic hepatitis as mild (Maddrey's score less than 32) and severe (Maddrey's 
      score 32 or more). We allowed cointerventions in the trial groups, provided they 
      were similar. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed Cochrane methodology, 
      performing the meta-analyses using Review Manager 5. We presented the results of 
      dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and of continuous outcomes as mean 
      difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used both the fixed-effect 
      and the random-effects models for meta-analyses. Whenever there were significant 
      discrepancies in the results, we reported the more conservative point estimate of 
      the two. We considered a P value of 0.01 or less, two-tailed, as statistically 
      significant if the required information size was reached for our three primary 
      outcomes (all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life, and serious adverse 
      events during treatment) and our post hoc decision to include analyses of mortality 
      at more time points. We presented heterogeneity using the I² statistic. If trialists 
      used intention-to-treat analysis to deal with missing data, we used these data in 
      our primary analysis; otherwise, we used the available data. We assessed the bias 
      risk of the trials using bias risk domains and the certainty of the evidence using 
      GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All trials but 
      one were at overall high risk of bias. Fifteen trials (one of which was an abstract) 
      provided data for analysis (927 participants received glucocorticosteroids and 934 
      participants received placebo or no intervention). Glucocorticosteroids were 
      administered orally or parenterally for a median 28 days (range 3 days to 12 weeks). 
      The participants were between 25 and 70 years old, had different stages of alcoholic 
      liver disease, and 65% were men. Follow-up, when reported, was up to the moment of 
      discharge from the hospital, until they died (median of 63 days), or for at least 
      one year. There was no evidence of effect of glucocorticosteroids on all-cause 
      mortality up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 0.90, 95% CI 
      0.70 to 1.15; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low-certainty evidence) or on 
      health-related quality of life up to three months, measured with the European 
      Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions - 3 Levels scale (MD -0.04 points, 95% CI -0.11 to 
      0.03; participants = 377; trial = 1; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence 
      of effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events during treatment 
      (random-effects RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very 
      low-certainty evidence), liver-related mortality up to three months following 
      randomisation (random-effects RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.14; participants = 1861; 
      trials = 15; very low-certainty evidence), number of participants with any 
      complications up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 1.04, 
      95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; participants = 1861; very low-certainty evidence), and number 
      of participants of non-serious adverse events up to three months' follow-up after 
      end of treatment (random-effects RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 5.48; participants = 160; 
      trials = 4; very low-certainty evidence). Based on the information that we collected 
      from the published trial reports, only one of the trials seems not to be 
      industry-funded, and the remaining 15 trials did not report clearly whether they 
      were partly or completely funded by the industry. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are very 
      uncertain about the effect estimate of no difference between glucocorticosteroids 
      and placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality and serious adverse events 
      during treatment because the certainty of evidence was very low, and low for 
      health-related quality of life. Due to inadequate reporting, we cannot exclude 
      increases in adverse events. As the CIs were wide, we cannot rule out significant 
      benefits or harms of glucocorticosteroids. Therefore, we need placebo-controlled 
      randomised clinical trials, designed according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported 
      according to the CONSORT guidelines. Future trials ought to report depersonalised 
      individual participant data, so that proper individual participant data 
      meta-analyses of the effects of glucocorticosteroids in subgroups can be conducted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the world. 
      The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy has been demonstrated by published individual 
      patient data meta-analysis and Cochrane systematic review. However, there is no 
      consensus on which is the optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. Present network 
      meta-analysis aims to compare the differences of effect between all available 
      adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in improving overall survival and disease-free 
      survival, and to rate the certainty of evidence from present network meta-analysis. 
      METHODS: We will conduct this systematic review and network meta-analysis using 
      Bayesian method and according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and 
      Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement. We will search PubMed, EMBASE.com, the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese National Knowledge 
      Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Biological Medical Database (CBM), and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov/) to identify randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) comparing adjuvant chemotherapy to surgery alone. We will assess the 
      risk of bias of individual RCTs using a modified version of Cochrane tool. We will 
      also use the advance of GRADE to rate the certainty of network meta-analysis. Data 
      analysis will be performed with R-3.4.1 and WinBUGS software. RESULTS: The results 
      of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. DISCUSSION: To the best 
      of our knowledge, this systematic review and network meta-analysis will firstly use 
      both direct and indirect evidence to compare the differences of all available 
      adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for resected gastric cancer patients. This is a 
      protocol of systematic review and meta-analysis, so the ethical approval and patient 
      consent are not required.

AB  - We construct a framework for meta-analysis and other multi-level data structures 
      that codifies the sources of heterogeneity between studies or settings in treatment 
      effects and examines their implications for analyses. The key idea is to consider, 
      for each of the treatments under investigation, the subject's potential outcome in 
      each study or setting were he to receive that treatment. We consider four sources of 
      heterogeneity: (1) response inconsistency, whereby a subject's response to a given 
      treatment would vary across different studies or settings, (2) the grouping of 
      nonequivalent treatments, where two or more treatments are grouped and treated as a 
      single treatment under the incorrect assumption that a subject's responses to the 
      different treatments would be identical, (3) nonignorable treatment assignment, and 
      (4) response-related variability in the composition of subjects in different studies 
      or settings. We then examine how these sources affect heterogeneity/homogeneity of 
      conditional and unconditional treatment effects. To illustrate the utility of our 
      approach, we re-analyze individual participant data from 29 randomized 
      placebo-controlled studies on the cardiovascular risk of Vioxx, a Cox-2 selective 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved by the FDA in 1999 for the management 
      of pain and withdrawn from the market in 2004.

AB  - Meta-analyses are considered as an important pillar of evidence-based medicine. The 
      aim of this review is to describe the main principles of a meta-analysis and to use 
      examples of head and neck oncology to demonstrate their clinical impact and 
      methodological interest. The major role of individual patient data is outlined, as 
      well as the superiority of individual patient data over meta-analyses based on 
      published summary data. The major clinical breakthrough of head and neck 
      meta-analyses are summarized, regarding concomitant chemotherapy, altered 
      fractionated chemotherapy, new regimens of induction chemotherapy or the use of 
      radioprotectants. Recent methodological developments are described, including 
      network meta-analyses, the validation of surrogate markers. Lastly, the future of 
      meta-analyses is discussed in the context of personalized medicine.

AB  - Orteronel (TAK-700) is an oral, non-steroidal 17,20-lyase inhibitor with higher 
      specificity for 17,20 lyase over 17 hydroxylase. The first phase III studies showed 
      an advantage with orteronel compared with placebo in terms of progression free 
      survival and response of PSA. Unfortunately orteronel did not significantly prolong 
      the overall survival. In order to assess the efficacy of orteronel in prostate 
      cancer, we evaluated all available data on orteronel in the management of prostate 
      cancer. A total of 2716 patients were evaluated from 3 randomized trials. We showed 
      orteronel improved the progression free survival, time to PSA progression and PSA 
      response compared with the placebo. In conclusion, given the limitations a 
      literature rather than on individual patients' data meta-analysis, our data show a 
      clinical efficacy of orteronel in prostate cancer, therefore we deem that orteronel 
      may be investigated in combination with the other approved agents for CRPC or be 
      tested in prior setting of disease such as the hormone sensitive prostate cancer.

      clinical practice.
PG  - 1937-1948
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S168188 [doi]
AB  - COX2-selective and nonselective (ns) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
      are widely used for chronic pain management. There are marked differences in the 
      risk of adverse gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) events among different 
      NSAIDs. In 2017, publication of two randomized controlled trials and an individual 
      patient-data meta-analysis provided robust data on the relative GI and CV 
      tolerability profiles of currently available NSAIDs. The PRECISION study showed 
      similar CV-event rates with celecoxib vs naproxen and ibuprofen, but GI tolerability 
      was better for celecoxib. In the CONCERN study of high-GI-risk patients, celecoxib 
      was associated with fewer adverse GI-tract events than naproxen. The meta-analysis 
      showed no significant difference between celecoxib and ns-NSAIDs in the rate of 
      acute myocardial infarction, and celecoxib was the only COX2-selective NSAID with a 
      lower risk of adverse CV and GI events vs ns-NSAIDs. These data add to the body of 
      knowledge about the relative tolerability of different NSAIDs and were used to 
      propose an updated treatment algorithm. The decision about whether to use an NSAID 
      and which one should be based on a patient's risk of developing adverse GI and CV 
      events. Lower- and upper-GI-tract events need to be considered. Celecoxib has a 
      better lower-GI-tract tolerability profile than ns-NSAIDs plus a proton-pump 
      inhibitor. In addition, the latest data suggest that long-term use of celecoxib 200 
      mg/day may be appropriate for patients at increased CV risk.

TI  - How Many Patients With Schizophrenia Do Not Respond to Antipsychotic Drugs in the 
      Short Term? An Analysis Based on Individual Patient Data From Randomized Controlled 
      Trials.
PG  - 639-646
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sby095 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An important clinical question is how many patients with acute 
      schizophrenia do not respond to antipsychotics despite being treated for adequate 
      time and with an effective dose. However, up to date, the exact extent of the 
      phenomenon remains unclear. METHODS: We calculated the nonresponse and nonremission 
      percentages using individual patient data from 16 randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs). Six thousand two hundred twenty-one patients were assigned to one 
      antipsychotic (amisulpride, flupenthixol, haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, 
      risperidone, or ziprasidone) at an adequate dose; the response was assessed at 4-6 
      weeks. As various definitions of nonresponse have been used in the literature, we 
      applied 4 different cut-offs covering the whole range of percent Positive and 
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)/Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) reduction 
      (≤0%, <25%, <50%, <75%).For symptomatic remission, we used the definition proposed 
      by Andreasen without employing the time criterion. RESULTS: The overall nonresponse 
      for the cut-off of ≤0% PANSS/BPRS reduction was 19.8% (18.8%-20.8%); for the cut-off 
      of <25% reduction it was 43% (41.7%-44.3%); for the cut-off of <50% reduction it was 
      66.5% (65.3%-67.8%); and for the cut-off of <75% reduction it was 87% (86%-87.9%). 
      The overall percentage of no symptomatic remission was 66.9% (65.7%-68.1%). Earlier 
      onset of illness, lower baseline severity and the antipsychotic used were 
      significantly associated with higher nonresponse percentages. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Nonresponse and nonremission percentages were notably high. Nevertheless, the 
      patients in our analysis could represent a negative selection since they came from 
      short-term RCTs and could have been treated before study inclusion; thus, further 
      response may not have been observed. Observational studies on this important 
      question are needed.

TI  - Residual pulmonary vascular obstruction and recurrence after acute pulmonary 
      embolism: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual 
      participant data.
PG  - e023939

LID - e023939
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with a first, unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), the 
      optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy (AT) is controversial due to tightly 
      balanced risks and benefits of indefinite anticoagulation. The objective of this 
      study is to assess among patients with a first acute pulmonary embolism (PE) who 
      received ≥3 months of AT and thereafter had a planar lung scan, whether residual 
      pulmonary vascular obstruction (RPVO) is associated with VTE recurrence after 
      discontinuation of AT. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review 
      with a meta-analysis of individual participant data of contemporary studies 
      evaluating the prognostic significance of RPVO in patients with a first acute PE. We 
      will search from inception to 24 January 2018, PubMed, Medline, Embase and 
      Cochrane's Central Registry for Randomized Controlled Trials, CENTRAL for randomized 
      controlled trials and prospective cohort studies. Two reviewers will conduct all 
      screening and data collection independently. The methodological quality and risk of 
      bias of eligible studies will be carefully and rigorously assessed using the Risk Of 
      Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool. The primary objective will be 
      to assess the relationship between RPVO on ventilation-perfusion scan after 
      completion of at least 3 months of AT after an acute PE event, and the risk of an 
      objectively confirmed symptomatic recurrent VTE (including deep vein thrombosis or 
      PE) or death due to PE. The secondary objectives will include the assessment of the 
      optimal RPVO cut-off and the risk of recurrent VTE, as well as the relationship 
      between the relative change in RPVO between PE diagnosis and at discontinuation of 
      AT (≥3 months) and risk of recurrent VTE. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study of 
      secondary data does not require ethics approval. It will be presented 
      internationally and published in the peer-reviewed literature. PROSPERO REGISTRATION 
      NUMBER: CRD42017081080.

TI  - An overview of methods for network meta-analysis using individual participant data: 
      when do benefits arise?
PG  - 1351-1364
LID - 10.1177/0962280216660741 [doi]
AB  - Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a common approach to summarizing relative treatment 
      effects from randomized trials with different treatment comparisons. Most NMAs are 
      based on published aggregate data (AD) and have limited possibilities for 
      investigating the extent of network consistency and between-study heterogeneity. 
      Given that individual participant data (IPD) are considered the gold standard in 
      evidence synthesis, we explored statistical methods for IPD-NMA and investigated 
      their potential advantages and limitations, compared with AD-NMA. We discuss several 
      one-stage random-effects NMA models that account for within-trial imbalances, 
      treatment effect modifiers, missing response data and longitudinal responses. We 
      illustrate all models in a case study of 18 antidepressant trials with a continuous 
      endpoint (the Hamilton Depression Score). All trials suffered from drop-out; 
      missingness of longitudinal responses ranged from 21 to 41% after 6 weeks follow-up. 
      Our results indicate that NMA based on IPD may lead to increased precision of 
      estimated treatment effects. Furthermore, it can help to improve network consistency 
      and explain between-study heterogeneity by adjusting for participant-level effect 
      modifiers and adopting more advanced models for dealing with missing response data. 
      We conclude that implementation of IPD-NMA should be considered when trials are 
      affected by substantial drop-out rate, and when treatment effects are potentially 
      influenced by participant-level covariates.

TI  - Cognitive Bias Modification for Behavior Change in Alcohol and Smoking Addiction: 
      Bayesian Meta-Analysis of Individual Participant Data.
PG  - 52-78
LID - 10.1007/s11065-018-9386-4 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) refers to a family of interventions targeting 
      substance-related cognitive biases, which have been found to play a role in the 
      maintenance of addictive behaviors. In this study, we conducted a Bayesian 
      meta-analysis of individual patient data from studies investigating the effects of 
      CBM as a behavior change intervention for the treatment of alcohol and tobacco use 
      disorders, in individuals aware of the behavior change goal of the studies. Main 
      outcomes included reduction in the targeted cognitive biases after the intervention 
      and in substance use or relapse rate at the short-to-long term follow-up. Additional 
      moderators, both at the study-level (type of addiction and CBM training) and at the 
      participant-level (amount of completed training trials, severity of substance use), 
      were progressively included in a series of hierarchical mixed-effects models. We 
      included 14 studies involving 2435 participants. CBM appeared to have a small effect 
      on cognitive bias (0.23, 95% credible interval = 0.06-0.41) and relapse rate (-0.27, 
      95% credible interval = -0.68 - 0.22), but not on reduction of substance use. 
      Increased training practice showed a paradoxical moderation effect on relapse, with 
      a relatively lower chance of relapse in the control condition with increased 
      practice, compared to the training condition. All effects were associated with 
      extremely wide 95% credible intervals, which indicate the absence of enough evidence 
      in favor or against a reliable effect of CBM on cognitive bias and relapse rate in 
      alcohol and tobacco use disorders. Besides the need for a larger body of evidence, 
      research on the topic would benefit from a stronger adherence to the current 
      methodological standards in randomized controlled trial design and the systematic 
      investigation of shared protocols of CBM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Greater transparency, including sharing of patient-level data for 
      further research, is an increasingly important topic for organisations who sponsor, 
      fund and conduct clinical trials. This is a major paradigm shift with the aim of 
      maximising the value of patient-level data from clinical trials for the benefit of 
      future patients and society. We consider the analysis of shared clinical trial data 
      in three broad categories: (1) reanalysis - further investigation of the efficacy 
      and safety of the randomized intervention, (2) meta-analysis, and (3) supplemental 
      analysis for a research question that is not directly assessing the randomized 
      intervention. DISCUSSION: In order to support appropriate interpretation and limit 
      the risk of misleading findings, analysis of shared clinical trial data should have 
      a pre-specified analysis plan. However, it is not generally possible to limit bias 
      and control multiplicity to the extent that is possible in the original trial 
      design, conduct and analysis, and this should be acknowledged and taken into account 
      when interpreting results. We highlight a number of areas where specific 
      considerations arise in planning, conducting, interpreting and reporting analyses of 
      shared clinical trial data. A key issue is that that these analyses essentially 
      share many of the limitations of any post hoc analyses beyond the original specified 
      analyses. The use of individual patient data in meta-analysis can provide increased 
      precision and reduce bias. Supplemental analyses are subject to many of the same 
      issues that arise in broader epidemiological analyses. Specific discussion topics 
      are addressed within each of these areas. Increased provision of patient-level data 
      from industry and academic-led clinical trials for secondary research can benefit 
      future patients and society. Responsible data sharing, including transparency of the 
      research objectives, analysis plans and of the results will support appropriate 
      interpretation and help to address the risk of misleading results and avoid 
      unfounded health scares.

TI  - Empirical or microbiologically guided systemic antimicrobials as adjuncts to 
      non-surgical periodontal therapy? A systematic review.
PG  - 999-1012
LID - 10.1111/jcpe.13164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether patients with specific subgingival microbiological 
      profiles benefit more from adjunctive systemic antibiotics. AIMS: To answer the 
      question: "What is the clinical benefit in periodontitis patients taking adjunctive 
      systemic antimicrobials to non-surgical therapy, depending on pre-treatment 
      detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria?" MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search was 
      conducted in four electronic databases for randomized controlled trials reporting 
      clinical outcomes following adjunctive antibiotic therapy for patients divided by 
      baseline microbiological profiles. RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 643 
      papers, reduced to five after screening and author contact. Four of these studies 
      were suitable for a fixed effects two-stage individual participant data 
      meta-analysis adjusted for baseline data. Collectively, adjunctive amoxicillin and 
      metronidazole yielded superior clinical results (measured as reduction of PPDs) 
      compared to placebo. No significant differences were detected for the effect of 
      adjunctive antibiotics by the detection of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans on 
      PPDs ≥ 5 mm (WMD = 1.16, 95% CI [-5.37, 7.68], I(2)  = 37.8%) or other clinical 
      outcomes. All included studies had low risk of bias. CONCLUSION: There is no 
      evidence to suggest that baseline detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria should 
      be used as criterion for prescribing adjunctive antibiotics, although only limited 
      information on microbial data and specific antimicrobials was available for 
      analysis.

PG  - 2865-2880
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2018.1479780 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To synthesize evidence of the effectiveness of socio-ecological 
      resilience rehabilitation programs on returning to work (RTW), self-efficacy, and 
      stress mitigation following traumatic physical injuries.Methods: PubMed, Scopus, 
      Proquest, Cinahl, Web of Science, Clinical Trials Database, and the Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched. Methodological quality was 
      assessed using the PEDro tool.Study selection: Randomized interventions aimed at 
      promoting resilience.Data extraction: Twenty one studies were reviewed (11,904 
      participants). Data from 19 studies of high methodological quality were pooled using 
      a random-effects meta-analysis. Mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk 
      ratios for binary outcomes were calculated.Data synthesis: Resilience rehabilitation 
      programs significantly increased the likelihood of ever RTW (OR 2.09, 95% CI 
      0.99-4.44, p = 0.05), decreased the number of days taken to return to work (mean 
      difference -7.80, 95% CI -13.16 to -2.45, p ≤ 0.001), and increased total 
      self-efficacy scores (mean difference 5.19, 95% CI 3.12-7.26, p < 0.001). Subgroup 
      analyses found that favorable return to work outcomes resulted from programs 
      involving workplace support (p < 0.001) and for people with musculoskeletal or 
      orthopedic injuries (p = 0.02).Conclusions: Compared to rehabilitation programs 
      providing standard care following injuries, programs aimed at developing resilience 
      could improve reemployment outcomes and self-efficacy.Implications for 
      rehabilitationIndividual resilience may be an important factor promoting functional 
      recovery after traumatic injury.Resilience rehabilitation programs are effective in 
      enabling patients' return to work and increasing their self efficacy. In particular, 
      programs involving the workplace are important components for enabling optimal work 
      participation outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, no specific drug-eluting stent (DES) has fully proven its 
      superiority over others in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction 
      (STEMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of 
      this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of coronary artery stents in STEMI 
      patients in a patient-level network meta-analysis. METHODS: Eligible studies were 
      dedicated randomized controlled trials comparing different stents in STEMI patients 
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with at least 12 months of clinical 
      follow-up. Of 19 studies identified from the published data, individual patient data 
      were collected in 15 studies with 10,979 patients representing 87.7% of patients in 
      the overall network of evidence. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiac 
      death, reinfarction, or target lesion revascularization. RESULTS: Overall, 8,487 
      (77.3%) of 10,979 STEMI patients were male and the mean age was 60.7 years. At a 
      median follow-up of 3 years, compared with bare-metal stents (BMS), patients treated 
      with paclitaxel-, sirolimus-, everolimus-, or biolimus-eluting stents had a 
      significantly lower risk of the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs]: 0.74 
      [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63 to 0.88], 0.65 [95% CI: 0.49 to 0.85], 0.70 
      [95% CI: 0.53 to 0.91], and 0.66 [95% CI: 0.49 to 0.88], respectively). The risk of 
      primary endpoint was not different between patients treated with BMS and 
      zotarolimus-eluting stents (adjusted HR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.51 to 1.38]). Among 
      patients treated with DES, no significant difference in the risk of the primary 
      outcome was demonstrated. Treatment with second-generation DES was associated with 
      significantly lower risk of definite or probable stent thrombosis compared with BMS 
      (adjusted HR: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.42 to 0.89]) and first-generation DES (adjusted HR: 
      0.56 [95% CI: 0.36 to 0.88]). CONCLUSIONS: In STEMI patients, DES were superior to 
      BMS with respect to long-term efficacy. No difference in long-term efficacy and 
      safety was observed among specific DES. Second-generation were superior to 
      first-generation DES in reducing stent thrombosis. (Clinical Outcomes After Primary 
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention [PCI] Using Contemporary Drug-Eluting Stent

AB  - Meta-analysis, a statistical combination of results of several trials to produce a 
      summary effect, has been subject to criticism in the past, mainly for the reasons of 
      poor quality of included studies, heterogeneity between studies meta-analyzed and 
      failing to address publication bias. These limitations can cause the results to be 
      misleading, which is important if policy and practice decisions are based on 
      systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We elaborate on these limitations and 
      illustrate them with examples from the nephrology literature. Finally, we present 
      some potential solutions, notably, education in meta-analysis for evidence producers 
      and consumers as well as the use of individual patient data for meta-analyses.

TI  - Multivariate meta-analysis model for the difference in restricted mean survival 
      times.
LID - kxz018 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/biostatistics/kxz018 [doi]
AB  - In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with time-to-event outcomes, the difference 
      in restricted mean survival times (RMSTD) offers an absolute measure of the 
      treatment effect on the time scale. Computation of the RMSTD relies on the choice of 
      a time horizon, $\tau$. In a meta-analysis, varying follow-up durations may lead to 
      the exclusion of RCTs with follow-up shorter than $\tau$. We introduce an individual 
      patient data multivariate meta-analysis model for RMSTD estimated at multiple time 
      horizons. We derived the within-trial covariance for the RMSTD enabling the 
      synthesis of all data by borrowing strength from multiple time points. In a 
      simulation study covering 60 scenarios, we compared the statistical performance of 
      the proposed method to that of two univariate meta-analysis models, based on 
      available data at each time point and based on predictions from flexible parametric 
      models. Our multivariate model yields smaller mean squared error over univariate 
      methods at all time points. We illustrate the method with a meta-analysis of five 
      RCTs comparing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with surgical 
      replacement in patients with aortic stenosis. Over 12, 24, and 36 months of 
      follow-up, those treated by TAVR live 0.28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 
      0.56], 0.46 (95% CI $-$0.08 to 1.01), and 0.79 (95% CI $-$0.43 to 2.02) months 
      longer on average compared to those treated by surgery, respectively.

AB  - This study evaluated the prognostic impact of ACT in patients who achieved a 
      pathological complete response (pCR). Articles published from January 1990 to 
      September 2018 were searched in EMBASE, PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane 
      Library. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival 
      (OS) were extracted. Thirteen observational studies were included. There were four 
      National Cancer Database studies with overlapping study periods, thus individual 
      pooled analyses of four different datasets were conducted (n = 3,182, 3,330, 3,575, 
      and 4,739 for pooled analysis sets including Dossa et al., Polanco et al., Xu et 
      al., and Shahab et al., respectively). Although a trend toward improved OS with ACT 
      was observed, statistical significance was not proven (P = 0.09, P = 0.03, P = 0.12, 
      and P = 0.10, respectively). When we performed a stratified analysis comparing the 
      results from single institution and multicenter studies, there was no significant 
      prognostic benefit of ACT. Publication bias was not observed. Routine use of ACT in 
      patients with a pCR could not be warranted from the present meta-analysis. Further 
      study of individual patient data from randomized trials is needed to clarify the 
      role of ACT.

TI  - Adjuvant Therapy of Resected Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: can We Move Forward?
PG  - 54
LID - 10.1007/s11864-016-0429-x [doi]
AB  - Twenty years ago, an individual patient data meta-analysis of eight cisplatin-based 
      adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) studies in completely resected early stage non-small cell 
      lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrated a 13 % reduction of the risk of death favoring 
      chemotherapy that was of borderline statistical significance (p = 0.08). This 
      marginal benefit boosted a new generation of randomized trials to evaluate the role 
      of modern platinum-based regimens in resectable stages of NSCLC and, although 
      individual studies generated conflicting results, overall they contributed to 
      confirm the role of AC which is now recommended for completely resected stage II and 
      III NSCLC, mostly 4 cycles, while subset analyses suggested a benefit in patients 
      with large IB tumors. Cisplatin-based therapy was the core regimen of those adjuvant 
      clinical trials and even if a substitution with other platinum-derived was also 
      suggested, mainly based on extrapolated data from studies in advanced disease, 
      cisplatin was confirmed to be slightly superior to carboplatin and is still the drug 
      of choice in the adjuvant setting. Currently, any attempt to improve efficacy of 
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy through antiangiogenic drugs association or 
      pharmacogenomics approaches have failed, while results of additional studies are 
      eagerly awaited. In the context of promising targeted therapies, even if several 
      randomized trials in the advanced setting evaluated tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
      (TKis) versus platinum-based chemotherapy and showed impressive results, clinical 
      experience with TKIs in the adjuvant setting is still limited and most of the trials 
      have not required patients to be molecularly tested for the drug-specific molecular 
      predictive factor. At the present time, the role of targeted agents as adjuvant 
      approaches remains largely not investigated. Finally, with the negative experience 
      of the use of vaccines in this setting, the integration of immunotherapy (mainly 
      immunocheckpoint inhibitors) in platinum-based schedules has just started to be 
      evaluated, representing a potential future clinical option, but still far from 
      clinical practice.

TI  - [Training to improve quality of life and physical functioning in cancer; which type 
      of training, for which patient, and at which moment?].
PG  - D2443
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the effects of exercise on quality of life and 
      physical functioning in patients with cancer is dependent upon certain patient 
      characteristics or on specific training programmes. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of 
      individual patient data (IPD) and a standard meta-analysis of randomized 
      interventional studies. METHOD: Results from various randomized interventional 
      studies were pooled for the analysis. Differences in effects of exercise among 
      patients with different demographic and clinical characteristics were investigated 
      using interaction terms applied to IPD. Differences in the effects of different 
      training programmes were studied via subgroup analyses on published data. RESULTS: 
      We found a small but significant positive effect of physical training on quality of 
      life and physical functioning. In the IPD meta-analysis, we found no differences in 
      the effects of physical training among patients with different demographic and 
      clinical characteristics. In both the IPD and the standard meta-analysis we found a 
      significant difference in the effect on quality of life (p < 0.01) and physical 
      functioning (p = 0.01) between supervised and non-supervised training. In the 
      standard meta-analysis we found a significantly greater effect of non-supervised 
      training when the predetermined weekly energy use was higher. CONCLUSION: Results 
      showed that physical training during and after cancer treatment can lead to 
      improvement in quality of life and physical functioning. There was no difference in 
      effect among different patient groups. Supervised training programmes resulted in 
      greater effects than non-supervised training programmes. The effects of 
      non-supervised training programmes were greater when the predetermined weekly energy 
      use was higher.

TI  - Predicting antidepressant response by monitoring early improvement of individual 
      symptoms of depression: individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 4-10
LID - 10.1192/bjp.2018.122 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improvement in depression within the first 2 weeks of antidepressant 
      treatment predicts good outcomes, but non-improvers can still respond or remit, 
      whereas improvers often do not.AimsWe aimed to investigate whether early improvement 
      of individual depressive symptoms better predicts response or remission. METHOD: We 
      obtained individual patient data of 30 trials comprising 2184 placebo-treated and 
      6058 antidepressant-treated participants. Primary outcome was week 6 response; 
      secondary outcomes were week 6 remission and week 12 response and remission. We 
      compared models that only included improvement in total score by week 2 (total 
      improvement model) with models that also included improvement in individual 
      symptoms. RESULTS: For week 6 response, the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve and negative and positive predictive values of the total 
      improvement model were 0.73, 0.67 and 0.74 compared with 0.77, 0.70 and 0.71 for the 
      item improvement model. Model performance decreased for week 12 outcomes. Of 
      predicted non-responders, 29% actually did respond by week 6 and 43% by week 12, 
      which was decreased from the baseline (overall) probabilities of 51% by week 6 and 
      69% by week 12. In post hoc analyses with continuous rather than dichotomous early 
      improvement, including individual items did not enhance model performance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Examining individual symptoms adds little to the predictive ability of 
      early improvement. Additionally, early non-improvement does not rule out response or 
      remission, particularly after 12 rather than 6 weeks. Therefore, our findings 
      suggest that routinely adapting pharmacological treatment because of limited early 
      improvement would often be premature.Declaration of interestNone.

TI  - Efficient two-step multivariate random effects meta-analysis of individual 
      participant data for longitudinal clinical trials using mixed effects models.
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/s12874-019-0676-1 [doi]
LID - 33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mixed effects models have been widely applied in clinical trials that 
      involve longitudinal repeated measurements, which possibly contain missing outcome 
      data. In meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) based on these 
      longitudinal studies, joint synthesis of the regression coefficient parameters can 
      improve efficiency, especially for explorations of effect modifiers that are useful 
      to predict the response or lack of response to particular treatments. METHODS: In 
      this article, we provide a valid and efficient two-step method for IPD meta-analyses 
      using the mixed effects models that adequately addresses the between-studies 
      heterogeneity using random effects models. The two-step method overcomes the 
      practical difficulties of computations and modellings of the heterogeneity in the 
      one-step method, and enables valid inference without loss of efficiency. We also 
      show the two-step method can effectively circumvent the modellings of the 
      between-studies heterogeneity of the variance-covariance parameters and provide 
      valid and efficient estimators for the regression coefficient parameters, which are 
      the primary objects of interests in the longitudinal studies. In addition, these 
      methods can be easily implemented using standard statistical packages, and enable 
      synthesis of IPD from different sources (e.g., from different platforms of clinical 
      trial data sharing systems). RESULTS: To assess the proposed method, we conducted 
      simulation studies and also applied the method to an IPD meta-analysis of clinical 
      trials for new generation antidepressants. Through the numerical studies, the 
      validity and efficiency of the proposed method were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      two-step approach is an effective method for IPD meta-analyses of longitudinal 
      clinical trials using mixed effects models. It can also effectively circumvent the 
      modellings of the between-studies heterogeneity of the variance-covariance 
      parameters, and enable efficient inferences for the regression coefficient 
      parameters.

TI  - Smoking Cessation Pharmacotherapy Based on Genetically-Informed Biomarkers: What is 
      the Evidence?
PG  - 1289-1293
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntz009 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pharmacogenomic studies have used genetic variants to identify smokers 
      likely to respond to pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation. METHODS: We 
      performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of primary and secondary analyses of 
      trials of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. Eligible were trials with data on a 
      priori selected single nucleotide polymorphisms, replicated non-single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms, and/or the nicotine metabolite ratio. We estimated the genotype × 
      treatment interaction as the ratio of risk ratios (RRR) for treatment effects across 
      genotype groups. RESULTS: We identified 18 trials (N = 9017 participants), including 
      40 active (bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], varenicline, or 
      combination therapies) versus placebo comparisons and 16 active versus active 
      comparisons. There was statistical evidence of heterogeneity across rs16969968 
      genotypes in CHRNA5 with regard to both 6-month abstinence and end-of-treatment 
      abstinence in non-Hispanic black smokers and end-of-treatment abstinence in 
      non-Hispanic white smokers. There was also heterogeneity across rs1051730 genotypes 
      in CHRNA3 with regard to end-of-treatment abstinence in non-Hispanic white smokers. 
      There was no clear statistical evidence for other genotype-by-treatment 
      combinations. Compared with placebo, NRT was more effective among non-Hispanic black 
      smokers with rs16969968-GG with regard to both 6-month abstinence (RRR for GG vs. GA 
      or AA, 3.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to 10.30) and end-of-treatment 
      abstinence (RRR for GG vs. GA or AA, 5.84; 95% CI = 1.89 to 18.10). Among 
      non-Hispanic white smokers, NRT effectiveness relative to placebo was comparable 
      across rs1051730 and rs169969960 genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify 
      widespread differential effects of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies based on 
      genotype. The quality of the evidence is generally moderate. IMPLICATIONS: Although 
      we identified some evidence of genotype × treatment interactions, the vast majority 
      of analyses did not provide evidence of differential treatment response by genotype. 
      Where we find some evidence, these results should be considered preliminary and 
      interpreted with caution because of the small number of contributing trials per 
      genotype comparison, the wide confidence intervals, and the moderate quality of 
      evidence. Prospective trials and individual-patient data meta-analyses accounting 
      for heterogeneity of treatment effects through modeling are needed to assess the 
      clinical utility of genetically informed biomarkers to guide pharmacotherapy choice 
      for smoking cessation.

TI  - Relapse-Free Survival as a Surrogate for Overall Survival in the Evaluation of Stage 
      II-III Melanoma Adjuvant Therapy.
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djx133 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed whether relapse-free survival (RFS; time until 
      recurrence/death) is a valid surrogate for overall survival (OS) among resected 
      stage II-III melanoma patients through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials. METHODS: Individual patient data (IPD) on RFS and OS were collected from 
      5826 patients enrolled in 11 randomized adjuvant trials comparing interferon (IFN) 
      to observation. In addition, IPD from two studies comparing IFN and vaccination in 
      989 patients were included. A two-level modeling approach was used for assessing 
      Spearman's patient-level correlation (rho) of RFS and OS and the trial-level 
      coefficient of determination (R²) of the treatment effects on RFS and on OS. The 
      results were validated externally in 13 adjuvant studies without available IPD. We 
      then tested the results on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of 
      Cancer (EORTC) 18071 double-blind trial comparing ipilimumab 10 mg/kg with placebo, 
      which showed a statistically significant impact of the checkpoint inhibitor on RFS 
      and OS. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 
      seven years, 12 of 13 trials showed a consistency between the IFN vs No IFN 
      differences regarding RFS (hazard ratio [HR]RFS = 0.88) and OS (HROS = 0.91), but 
      the small trial, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 2696, was an outlier (HRRFS = 
      0.72 vs HROS = 1.11). Therefore, even if rho was high, R² was low and could not 
      reliably be estimated. Based on the 12 trials, rho remained high (0.89), and the 
      hazard ratios for RFS and OS were strongly correlated (R² = 0.91). The surrogate 
      threshold effect for RFS was estimated to be 0.77. For the EORTC 18071 trial, the 
      hazard ratio for RFS was 0.75, predicting an effect of ipilimumab on OS. This was 
      subsequently confirmed (HROS = 0.72, 95.1% confidence interval = 0.58 to 0.88, P = 
      .001). CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk stage II-III melanoma, RFS appeared to be a valid 
      surrogate end point for OS for adjuvant randomized studies assessing interferon or a 
      checkpoint inhibitor. In future similar adjuvant studies, a hazard ratio for RFS of 
      0.77 or less would predict a treatment impact on OS.

TI  - Vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women.
PG  - CD005944
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD005944.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In areas where vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a public health concern, 
      the maternal dietary intake of vitamin A may be not sufficient to meet either the 
      maternal nutritional requirements, or those of the breastfed infant, due the low 
      retinol concentrations in breast milk. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of 
      vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women on maternal and infant health. SEARCH 
      METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register 
      (8 February 2016), LILACS (1982 to December 2015), Web of Science (1945 to December 
      2015), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised 
      controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster-randomised trials that assessed the effects of 
      vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women on maternal and infant health 
      (morbidity, mortality and vitamin A nutritional status). DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, conducted 
      data extraction, assessed risk of bias and checked for accuracy. We assessed the 
      quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen trials of 
      mainly low or unclear risk of bias, enrolling 25,758 women and infant pairs were 
      included. The supplementation schemes included high, single or double doses of 
      vitamin A (200,000 to 400,000 internation units (IU)), or 7.8 mg daily beta-carotene 
      compared with placebo, no treatment, other (iron); or higher (400,000 IU) versus 
      lower dose (200,000 IU). In all trials, a considerable proportion of infants were at 
      least partially breastfed until six months. Supplement (vitamin A as retinyl, 
      water-miscible or beta-carotene) 200,000 to 400,000 IU versus control (placebo or no 
      treatment) Maternal: We did not find evidence that vitamin A supplementation reduced 
      maternal mortality at 12 months (hazard ratio (HR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 0.44 to 2.21; 8577 participants; 1 RCT, moderate-quality evidence). Effects 
      were less certain at six months (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.71; 564 
      participants; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). The effect on maternal morbidity 
      (diarrhoea, respiratory infections, fever) was uncertain because the quality of 
      evidence was very low (50 participants, 1 RCT). We found insufficient evidence that 
      vitamin A increases abdominal pain (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.73; 786 participants; 
      1 RCT; low-quality evidence). We found low-quality evidence that vitamin A 
      supplementation increased breast milk retinol concentrations by 0.20 µmol/L at three 
      to three and a half months (mean difference (MD) 0.20 µmol/L, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.31; 
      837 participants; 6 RCTs). Infant: We did not find evidence that vitamin A 
      supplementation reduced infant mortality at two to 12 months (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 
      to 1.52; 6090 participants; 5 RCTs; low-quality evidence). Effects on morbidity 
      (gastroenteritis at three months) was uncertain (RR 6.03, 95% CI 0.30 to 121.82; 84 
      participants; 1 RCT; very low-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence for 
      the effect on infant adverse outcomes (bulging fontanelle at 24 to 48 hours) (RR 
      2.00, 95% CI 0.61 to 6.55; 444 participants; 1 RCT). Supplement (vitamin A as 
      retinyl) 400,000 IU versus 200,000 IUThree studies (1312 participants) were included 
      in this comparison. None of the studies assessed maternal mortality, maternal 
      morbidity or infant mortality. Findings from one study showed that there may be 
      little or no difference in infant morbidity between the doses (diarrhoea, 
      respiratory illnesses, and febrile illnesses) (312 participants, data not pooled). 
      No firm conclusion could be drawn on the impact on maternal and infant adverse 
      outcomes (limited data available).The effect on breast milk retinol was also 
      uncertain due to the small amount of information available. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: 
      There was no evidence of benefit from different doses of vitamin A supplementation 
      for postpartum women on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, compared with 
      other doses or placebo. Although maternal breast milk retinol concentrations 
      improved with supplementation, this did not translate to health benefits for either 
      women or infants. Few studies reported on maternal and infant mortality and 
      morbidity. Future studies should include these important outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sharing individual participant data (IPD) among 
      researchers, on request, is an ethical and responsible practice. Despite numerous 
      calls for this practice to be standard, however, research indicates that primary 
      study authors are often unwilling to share IPD, even for use in a meta-analysis. 
      This study sought to examine researchers' reservations about data sharing and to 
      evaluate the impact of sending a data-sharing agreement on researchers' attitudes 
      toward sharing IPD. METHODS: To investigate these questions, we conducted a 
      randomized controlled trial in conjunction with a Web-based survey. We searched for 
      and invited primary study authors of studies included in recent meta-analyses. We 
      emailed more than 1,200 individuals, and 247 participated. The survey asked 
      individuals about their transparent research practices, general concerns about 
      sharing data, attitudes toward sharing data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, and 
      concerns about sharing data in the context of a meta-analysis. We hypothesized that 
      participants who were randomly assigned to receive a data-sharing agreement would be 
      more willing to share their primary study's IPD. RESULTS: Results indicated that 
      participants who received a data-sharing agreement were more willing to share their 
      data set, compared with control participants, even after controlling for 
      demographics and pretest values (d = 0.65, 95% CI [0.39, 0.90]). A member of the 
      control group is 24 percent more likely to share her data set should she receive the 
      data-sharing agreement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings shed light on data-sharing 
      practices, attitudes, and concerns and can be used to inform future meta-analysis 
      projects seeking to collect IPD, as well as the field at large.

TI  - The Accuracy of Clinical Staging of Stage I-IIIa Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: An 
      Analysis Based on Individual Participant Data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) helps determine 
      the prognosis and treatment of patients; few data exist on the accuracy of clinical 
      staging and the impact on treatment and survival of patients. We assessed whether 
      participant or trial characteristics were associated with clinical staging accuracy 
      as well as impact on survival. METHODS: We used individual participant data from 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs), supplied for a meta-analysis of preoperative 
      chemotherapy (± radiotherapy) vs surgery alone (± radiotherapy) in NSCLC. We 
      assessed agreement between clinical TNM (cTNM) stage at randomization and pathologic 
      TNM (pTNM) stage, for participants in the control group. RESULTS: Results are based 
      on 698 patients who received surgery alone (± radiotherapy) with data for cTNM and 
      pTNM stage. Forty-six percent of cases were cTNM stage I, 23% were cTNM stage II, 
      and 31% were cTNM stage IIIa. cTNM stage disagreed with pTNM stage in 48% of cases, 
      with 34% clinically understaged and 14% clinically overstaged. Agreement was not 
      associated with age (P = .12), sex (P = .62), histology (P = .82), staging method 
      (P = .32), or year of randomization (P = .98). Poorer survival in understaged 
      patients was explained by the underlying pTNM stage. Clinical staging failed to 
      detect T4 disease in 10% of cases and misclassified nodal disease in 38%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates suboptimal agreement between clinical and 
      pathologic staging. Discrepancies between clinical and pathologic T and N staging 
      could have led to different treatment decisions in 10% and 38% of cases, 
      respectively. There is therefore a need for further research into improving staging 
      accuracy for patients with stage I-IIIa NSCLC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) improves survival without 
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) for preterm African American infants. STUDY DESIGN: 
      An individual participant data meta-analysis was conducted, including 3 randomized, 
      placebo-controlled trials that enrolled infants born at  <34 weeks of gestation 
      receiving respiratory support, had at least 15% (or a minimum of 10 infants in each 
      trial arm) of African American race, and used a starting iNO of >5  parts per 
      million with the intention to treat for 7 days minimum. The primary outcome was a 
      composite of death or BPD. Secondary outcomes included death before discharge, 
      postnatal steroid use, gross pulmonary air leak, pulmonary hemorrhage, measures of 
      respiratory support, and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: Compared with other 
      races, African American infants had a significant reduction in the composite outcome 
      of death or BPD with iNO treatment: 49% treated vs 63% controls (relative risk, 
      0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.91; P = .003; interaction P = .016). There were no differences 
      between racial groups for death. There was also a significant difference between 
      races (interaction P = .023) of iNO treatment for BPD in survivors, with the 
      greatest effect in African American infants (P = .005). There was no difference 
      between racial groups in the use of postnatal steroids, pulmonary air leak, 
      pulmonary hemorrhage, or other measures of respiratory support. CONCLUSION: iNO 
      therapy should be considered for preterm African American infants at high risk for 
      BPD. iNO to prevent BPD in African Americans may represent an example of a racially 
      customized therapy for infants.

TI  - Placebo response in neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: a meta-analysis of 
      individual participant data.
PG  - 901-912
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S155979 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding factors associated with high placebo responses in clinical 
      trials increases the likelihood of detecting a meaningful treatment effect. The aim 
      of the present study was to identify subject-level factors that contribute to 
      placebo variability in patients with neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury 
      (SCI). METHODS: Multiple regression analysis of patient data from randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (duration >4 weeks) involving individuals 
      with SCI was performed. Patient demographics, as well as injury and pain 
      characteristics were examined for their association with changes in pain rating from 
      baseline to the end of the trial (i.e., placebo response). The overall effect of 
      individual predictors was quantified with meta-analysis statistics. RESULTS: A total 
      of 276 patients with SCI from six studies were included in the analysis. Based on 
      the meta-analysis of subject-level predictors, larger placebo responses were 
      associated with male subjects (β=0.635; standard error [SE]=0.262; p=0.016) and 
      higher baseline pain (β=-0.146; SE=0.073; p=0.044). There were no significant 
      effects for injury characteristics (i.e., severity, level, and time since injury) or 
      pain characteristics (i.e., location and evoked). No significant publication bias 
      was detected. CONCLUSION: The current meta-analysis of individual patient data 
      demonstrated the importance of sex and baseline pain intensity on changes in pain 
      ratings in the placebo arm of SCI central neuropathic pain randomized controlled 
      clinical trials. Overall, our findings indicate that placebo responses occur 
      independent of injury characteristics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-centered care should be the focus of health services, where 
      improvements in the communication skills of health professionals promote excellent 
      health and quality care. Thus, this study is a protocol for a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of training programs in communication 
      skills to promote self-efficacy in the communication of health personnel. METHODS: 
      This systematic review protocol is conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) statement guidelines and the Cochrane 
      Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The review should include studies 
      carried out with health professionals who have undergone training in communication 
      skills aimed at promoting their self-efficacy. Clinical trials (randomized, 
      non-randomized), community trials, and quasi-experimental studies should be 
      included. Therefore, the comprehensive search strategy will be conducted in the 
      following databases: PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Science Direct, 
      CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). 
      Two independent reviewers will conduct all study selection procedures, data 
      extraction, and methodological evaluation, and disagreements will be referred to a 
      third reviewer. RevMan 5.3 software will be used to gather data and perform the 
      meta-analysis if possible. RESULTS: This systematic review will provide evidence on 
      more effective programs for communication skills training and will consider 
      information such as duration, educational strategies, assessment measures, and 
      outcomes that promote health worker self-efficacy. DISCUSSION: This systematic 
      review should provide evidence for effective communication skills training for 
      health professionals in order to guide new strategies for quality care. 
      DISSEMINATION AND ETHICS: The findings of this scoping review will be disseminated 
      in print, at conferences, or via peer-reviewed journals. Ethical approval is not 
      necessary as this paper does not involve patient data. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

TI  - How often can meta-analyses of individual-level data individualize treatment? A 
      meta-epidemiologic study.
PG  - 596-608
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyy239 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the claimed main advantages of individual participant data 
      meta-analysis (IPDMA) is that it allows assessment of subgroup effects based on 
      individual-level participant characteristics, and eventually stratified medicine. In 
      this study, we evaluated the conduct and results of subgroup analyses in IPDMA. 
      METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from inception to 31 
      December 2014. We included papers if they described an IPDMA based on randomized 
      clinical trials that investigated a therapeutic intervention on human subjects and 
      in which the meta-analysis was preceded by a systematic literature search. We 
      extracted data items related to subgroup analysis and subgroup differences 
      (subgroup-treatment interaction p < 0.05). RESULTS: Overall, 327 IPDMAs were 
      eligible. A statistically significant subgroup-treatment interaction for the primary 
      outcome was reported in 102 (36.6%) of 279 IPDMAs that reported at least one 
      subgroup analysis. This corresponded to 187 different statistically significant 
      subgroup-treatment interactions: 124 for an individual-level subgrouping variable 
      (in 76 IPDMAs) and 63 for a group-level subgrouping variable (in 36 IPDMAs). Of the 
      187, only 7 (3.7%; 6 individual and 1 group-level subgrouping variables) had a large 
      difference between strata (standardized effect difference d  ≥  0.8). Among the 124 
      individual-level statistically significant subgroup differences, the IPDMA authors 
      claimed that 42 (in 21 IPDMAs) should lead to treating the subgroups differently. 
      None of these 42 had d  ≥  0.8. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of individual-level data 
      provides statistically significant interactions for relative treatment effects in 
      about a third of IPDMAs. A modest number of these interactions may offer 
      opportunities for stratified medicine decisions.

TI  - The efficacy of adjuvant immunochemotherapy with OK-432 after curative resection of 
      gastric cancer: an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials.
PG  - 616-624
LID - 10.1007/s10120-015-0489-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: OK-432 has been used as a cancer treatment for 40 years, and the 
      immunostimulatory effects of OK-432 therapy have been intensely investigated in 
      Japan. Recently, it has received attention as a possible booster for cancer vaccine 
      treatments. Our previous meta-analysis based on summary measures revealed a 
      significant improvement in the survival of patients with curatively resected gastric 
      cancer. However, it is impossible to exclude the possibility of bias due to several 
      prognostic factors. METHODS: We collected individual data for patients with stage 
      III or stage IV gastric cancer after curative resection from 14 trials that were 
      identified in a previous meta-analysis. Immunochemotherapy with OK-432 was compared 
      with treatment with standard chemotherapy on an intention-to-treat basis. The 
      primary end point was overall survival. Stratified survival analyses were performed 
      with the trial as the stratification factor. Subgroup analyses were also performed 
      according to the potential prognostic factors, which included pathological factors, 
      splenectomy, and delayed-type hypersensitivity. RESULTS: There were 796 and 726 
      patients in the OK-432 and control groups, respectively. The median overall survival 
      was 42.6 months for the OK-432 group and 32.3 months for the control group. The 
      overall hazard ratio was 0.88 (95 % confidence interval 0.77-1.00, p = 0.050). No 
      factor showed a statistically significant interaction in the subgroup analyses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that immunochemotherapy treatment with OK-432 could 
      have a borderline significant effect for patients with stage III or stage IV gastric 
      cancer after curative resection.

TI  - Baseline characteristics of the 1149 patients recruited into the Rapid Intervention 
      with Glyceryl trinitrate in Hypertensive stroke Trial-2 (RIGHT-2) randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 298-305
LID - 10.1177/1747493018816451 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High blood pressure is common in acute stroke and associated with a 
      worse functional outcome. Glyceryl trinitrate, a nitric oxide donor, lowers blood 
      pressure in acute stroke and may improve outcome. AIMS: Rapid Intervention with 
      Glyceryl trinitrate in Hypertensive stroke Trial-2 (RIGHT-2) tested the feasibility 
      of performing a UK multicenter ambulance-based stroke trial, and the safety and 
      efficacy of glyceryl trinitrate when administered by paramedics before hospital 
      admission. METHODS: Paramedic-led ambulance-based multicenter prospective randomized 
      single-blind blinded-endpoint parallel-group controlled trial of transdermal 
      glyceryl trinitrate (given for four days) versus sham in patients with ultra-acute 
      (<4 h) presumed stroke. Data are number (%), median (interquartile range) or mean 
      (standard deviation). RESULTS: Recruitment ran from October 2015 to 31 May 2018. A 
      total 1149 patients were recruited from eight UK ambulance services and taken to 54 
      acute hospitals. Baseline characteristics include: mean age 73 (15) years; female 
      555 (48%); median time from stroke to randomization 70 (45, 115) min; 
      face-arm-speech scale score 2.6 (0.5); and blood pressure 162 (25)/92 (18) mmHg. The 
      final diagnosis was ischemic stroke 52%, hemorrhagic stroke 13%, Transient Ischemic 
      Attack (TIA) 9%, and mimic 25%. The main trial results will be presented in quarter 
      4 2018. The results will also be included in updated Cochrane systematic reviews, 
      and individual patient data meta-analyses of all relevant randomized controlled 
      trials. CONCLUSION: It was feasible to perform a multicenter ambulance-based 
      ultra-acute stroke trial in the UK and to treat with glyceryl trinitrate versus 
      sham. The relatively unselected cohort of stroke patients is broadly representative 
      of those admitted to hospital in the UK. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN26986053.

TI  - Faster recovery and reduced paracetamol use - a meta-analysis of EPs 7630 in 
      children with acute respiratory tract infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fever is a very common adaptive immune response in acute respiratory 
      tract disorders during infancy. Antipyretic / analgesic drugs such as paracetamol 
      (acetaminophen) are widely used to improve the comfort of the child but may cause 
      medically unneeded antipyresis and rare but potentially serious side effects. We 
      assess whether treatment with Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs 7630 reduces the 
      administration of paracetamol in children with acute tonsillopharyngitis (ATP) or 
      acute bronchitis (AB). DESIGN: Meta-analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled 
      clinical trials. METHODS: We searched clinical trial registries (ISRCTN, 
      ClinicalTrials.gov ) and medical literature (MEDLINE, EMBASE), for randomised, 
      placebo-controlled trials investigating the administration of EPs 7630 to children 
      with ATP or AB and reporting the co-administration of paracetamol. Based on the 
      individual participant data of the eligible trials, study populations were 
      characterized according to sex and age, and meta-analyses were performed for 
      cumulative paracetamol use and ability to attend school at treatment end. RESULTS: 
      Six trials including a total of 523 children aged 6-10 years (EPs 7630: 265; 
      placebo: 258) and suffering from non-β-hemolytic streptococcal ATP (3 trials) or 
      from AB (3 trials) were identified and eligible. Children received EPs 7630 or 
      placebo for 6 (ATP) or 7 days (AB). Compared to placebo, EPs 7630 reduced the 
      cumulative dose of paracetamol in 5 out of the 6 trials, by an average of 244 mg 
      (Hedges' g; - 0.28; 95% confidence interval: [- 0.53; - 0.02]; p < 0.03). At 
      treatment end, 30.2% (EPs 7630) and 74.4% (placebo) of the children were still 
      unable to attend school (risk ratio: 0.43; 95% confidence interval: [0.29; 0.65]; 
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In children aged 6-10 years with AB or ATP, EPs 7630 
      alleviated the symptom burden and accelerated recovery. Although EPs 7630 has no 
      known antipyretic effect, concomitant use of paracetamol was reduced.

TI  - A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of published 
      randomized clinical trials comparing early versus interval appendectomy for children 
      with perforated appendicitis.
PG  - 649-55
LID - 10.1007/s00383-016-3897-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Our objective was to perform a meta-analysis on RCTs that compared outcomes 
      in children with perforated appendicitis (PA) who underwent either early 
      appendectomy (EA) or interval appendectomy (IA). We also sought to determine if the 
      presence of an intra-abdominal abscess (IAA) at admission impacted treatment 
      strategy and outcomes. METHODS: We identified two RCTs comparing EA versus IA in 
      children with PA. A meta-analysis was performed using regression models and the 
      overall adverse event rate was analyzed. The treatment effect variation depending on 
      the presence of IAA at admission was also evaluated. RESULTS: EA significantly 
      reduced the odds of an adverse event (OR 0.28, 95 % CI 0.1-0.77) and an unplanned 
      readmission (OR 0.08, 95 % CI 0.01-0.67), as well as the total charges (79 % of the 
      IA, 95 % CI 63-100) for those who did not have an IAA at admission. In children with 
      an IAA, there was no difference between EA and IA. However, heterogeneity of 
      treatment effect was present regarding IAA at presentation. CONCLUSIONS: While EA 
      appears to improve outcomes in patients without an abscess, the published data 
      support no significant difference in outcomes between EA and IA in patients with an 
      abscess.

TI  - Predictors of treatment dropout in self-guided web-based interventions for 
      depression: an 'individual patient data' meta-analysis.
PG  - 2717-26
LID - 10.1017/S0033291715000665 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that web-based interventions can be effective 
      treatments for depression. However, dropout rates in web-based interventions are 
      typically high, especially in self-guided web-based interventions. Rigorous 
      empirical evidence regarding factors influencing dropout in self-guided web-based 
      interventions is lacking due to small study sample sizes. In this paper we examined 
      predictors of dropout in an individual patient data meta-analysis to gain a better 
      understanding of who may benefit from these interventions. METHOD: A comprehensive 
      literature search for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychotherapy for 
      adults with depression from 2006 to January 2013 was conducted. Next, we approached 
      authors to collect the primary data of the selected studies. Predictors of dropout, 
      such as socio-demographic, clinical, and intervention characteristics were examined. 
      RESULTS: Data from 2705 participants across ten RCTs of self-guided web-based 
      interventions for depression were analysed. The multivariate analysis indicated that 
      male gender [relative risk (RR) 1.08], lower educational level (primary education, 
      RR 1.26) and co-morbid anxiety symptoms (RR 1.18) significantly increased the risk 
      of dropping out, while for every additional 4 years of age, the risk of dropping out 
      significantly decreased (RR 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Dropout can be predicted by several 
      variables and is not randomly distributed. This knowledge may inform tailoring of 
      online self-help interventions to prevent dropout in identified groups at risk.

PG  - 759-765
LID - 10.1177/1747493018772733 [doi]
AB  - Rationale Despite several large clinical trials assessing blood pressure lowering in 
      acute stroke, equipoise remains particularly for ischemic stroke. The "Blood 
      pressure in Acute Stroke Collaboration" commenced in the mid-1990s focussing on 
      systematic reviews and meta-analysis of blood pressure lowering in acute stroke. 
      From the start, Blood pressure in Acute Stroke Collaboration planned to assess 
      safety and efficacy of blood pressure lowering in acute stroke using individual 
      patient data. Aims To determine the optimal management of blood pressure in patients 
      with acute stroke, including both intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. 
      Secondary aims are to assess which clinical and therapeutic factors may alter the 
      optimal management of high blood pressure in patients with acute stroke and to 
      assess the effect of vasoactive treatments on hemodynamic variables. Methods and 
      design Individual patient data from randomized controlled trials of blood pressure 
      management in participants with ischemic stroke and/or intracerebral hemorrhage 
      enrolled during the ultra-acute (pre-hospital), hyper-acute (<6 h), acute (<48 h), 
      and sub-acute (<168 h) phases of stroke. Study outcomes The primary effect variable 
      will be functional outcome defined by the ordinal distribution of the modified 
      Rankin Scale; analyses will also be carried out in pre-specified subgroups to assess 
      the modifying effects of stroke-related and pre-stroke patient characteristics. Key 
      secondary variables will include clinical, hemodynamic and neuroradiological 
      variables; safety variables will comprise death and serious adverse events. 
      Discussion Study questions will be addressed in stages, according to the protocol, 
      before integrating these into a final overreaching analysis. We invite eligible 
      trials to join the collaboration.

TI  - Meta-analysis of the outcomes of treatment of internal carotid artery near 
      occlusion.
PG  - 665-671
LID - 10.1002/bjs.11159 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend treating patients with an internal carotid artery 
      near occlusion (ICANO) with best medical therapy (BMT) based on weak evidence. 
      Consequently, patients with ICANO were excluded from randomized trials. The aim of 
      this individual-patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was to determine the optimal 
      treatment approach. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE 
      and the Cochrane Library databases in January 2018. The primary outcome was the 
      occurrence of any stroke or death within the first 30 days of treatment, analysed by 
      multivariable mixed-effect logistic regression. The secondary outcome was the 
      occurrence of any stroke or death beyond 30 days up to 1 year after treatment, 
      evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: The search yielded 1526 
      articles, of which 61 were retrieved for full-text review. Some 32 studies met the 
      inclusion criteria and pooled IPD were available from 11 studies, including some 703 
      patients with ICANO. Within 30 days, any stroke or death was reported in six 
      patients (1·8 per cent) in the carotid endarterectomy (CEA) group, five (2·2 per 
      cent) in the carotid artery stenting (CAS) group and seven (4·9 per cent) in the BMT 
      group. This resulted in a higher 30-day stroke or death rate after BMT than after 
      CEA (odds ratio 5·63, 95 per cent c.i. 1·30 to 24·45; P = 0·021). No differences 
      were found between CEA and CAS. The 1-year any stroke- or death-free survival rate 
      was 96·1 per cent for CEA, 94·4 per cent for CAS and 81·2 per cent for BMT. 
      CONCLUSION: These data suggest that BMT alone is not superior to CEA or CAS with 
      respect to 30-day or 1-year stroke or death prevention in patients with ICANO. These 
      patients do not appear to constitute a high-risk group for surgery, and 
      consideration should made to including them in future RCTs of internal carotid 
      artery interventions.

TI  - Benefits and Risks of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: Methodologic Limitations 
      Lead to Clinical Uncertainties.
PG  - 502-505
LID - 10.1177/2168479018794159 [doi]
AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include traditional (tNSAIDs), such as 
      ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac, as well as selective cyclooxygenase-2 
      inhibitors (COXIBs), principally celecoxib. COXIBs were developed to decrease 
      gastrointestinal side effects. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration 
      strengthened its warning about the risks of non-aspirin NSAIDs on myocardial 
      infarction and stroke. The Cyclooxygenase 2 and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug 
      Trialist collaboration conducted a comprehensive worldwide meta-analysis using 
      individual patient data exploring the risks of various COXIBs and NSAIDs on 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recently, the results of the Prospective Randomized 
      Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety versus Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) 
      trial were published that tested risks of COXIBs and NSAIDs on CVD. Generally, data 
      from meta-analyses of trials not designed a priori to test hypotheses are less 
      reliable than large-scale randomized trials to test small to moderate benefits or 
      harm. When the sample size is large, randomization provides control of confounding 
      not possible to achieve in any observational study. Further, observational studies, 
      and especially claims data, have inherent confounding by indication larger than the 
      effects being sought. Nonetheless, trials must be of sufficient size and duration 
      and achieve high compliance and follow-up to avoid bias and confounding. In this 
      regard, PRECISION has high rates of nonadherence and losses to follow-up that may 
      have introduced bias and confounding. At present, therefore, it may be most prudent 
      for clinicians to remain uncertain about benefits and risks of these drugs and make 
      individual clinical judgments for each of their patients.

LID - 10.1111/eci.12694 [doi]
AB  - The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) has published a draft 
      proposal on de-identified individual clinical trial participant data (IPD) sharing, 
      stating that sharing trial data requires planning to ensure appropriate research 
      ethics committee approval and participants' informed consent. This is why its 
      implementation will be deferred for 1 year after the publication of the final 
      version of the policy. When conducting research with anonymous data, it is not 
      feasible to obtain the informed consent from research participants. De-identified 
      IPD are anonymous to the investigator who is performing the secondary analysis. 
      De-identified IPD meta-analyses have been conducted for decades. Public funders, 
      industry and foundations have recently implemented new IPD sharing procedures; 
      almost all trials used for secondary analyses so far were conducted without 
      participant's consent to de-identified IPD. As stated by the ICMJE, de-identified 
      IPD protects participant's confidentiality. It follows that publishing secondary 
      analyses from completed trials without participant's consent is ethically 
      acceptable. From the ethical perspective, the ICMJE requirement on de-identified IPD 
      sharing should be implemented from the day the policy is published.

      Second European Stroke Prevention Study [ESPS-2], Management of Atherothrombosis 
      With Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients [MATCH], Clopidogrel for High 
      Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance 
      [CHARISMA], European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischaemia Trial 
      [ESPRIT], and Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes [PRoFESS]) 
      including 45,195 patients with a TIA or noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. We studied 
      incidence rates of bleeding per antiplatelet regimen stratified by time from 
      randomization (≤30, 31-90, 91-180, 181-365, >365 days). We calculated incidence 
      rates per trial and pooled estimates with random-effects meta-analysis. We performed 
      Poisson regression to assess differences between time periods with adjustment for 
      age and sex. RESULTS: The incidence of major bleeding on aspirin plus clopidogrel 
      and aspirin plus -dipyridamole was highest in the first 30 days, 5.8 and 4.9 per 100 
      person-years, respectively, and was significantly higher than at 31 to 90 days (rate 
      ratio 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.16-3.40 for aspirin plus clopidogrel; rate 
      ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.24-3.03 for aspirin plus dipyridamole). 
      Incidence rates on aspirin and clopidogrel monotherapy were 2.8 and 2.5 per 100 
      person-years, respectively, in the first 30 days, with no significant change over 
      time. The time course was similar for gastrointestinal bleeds. There was no early 
      excess of intracranial hemorrhage in patients on either dual or single antiplatelet 
      therapy. CONCLUSION: Dual antiplatelet therapy is associated with high early risks 
      of major and gastrointestinal bleeding that decline after the first month in trial 
      cohorts.

TI  - The impact of patient global assessment in the definition of remission as a 
      predictor of long-term radiographic damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: 
      protocol for an individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 52-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Remission is the target for management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
      intensification of immunosuppressive therapy is recommended for those that do not 
      achieve this status. Patient global assessment (PGA) is the single patient reported 
      outcome considered in the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against 
      Rheumatism remission criteria, but its use as target has been questioned. The 
      primary aim of this study is to assess whether excluding PGA from the definition of 
      disease remission changes the association of disease remission with long-term 
      radiographic damage and physical function in patients with RA. METHODS: Individual 
      Patient Data Meta-analysis using data from randomized controlled trials of 
      biological and targeted synthetic agents, identified through ClinicalTrials.gov and 
      PubMed. Different remission states will be defined: (i) 4v-remission [tender (TJC28) 
      and swollen 28-joint counts (SJC28) both≤1, C-reactive protein (CRP)≤1 (mg/dl), and 
      PGA≤1 (0-10 scale)], (ii) 4v-near-remission (TJC28≤1, SJC28≤1, CRP≤1, and PGA>1), 
      (iii) non-remission (TJC28>1 or SJC28>1 or CRP>1), all mutually exclusive, and (iv) 
      3v-remission (TJC28≤1, SJC28≤1, CRP≤1). Likelihood ratios will be used to 
      descriptively compare whether meeting the 3v and 4v-remission criteria in a single 
      visit (at 6 or 12 months) predicts good outcome in the second year (1-2y). 
      Differences in the predictive value of PGA in the definition of remission will be 
      assessed by comparing the three mutually exclusive disease states using logistic 
      regression analysis. Good outcome is defined primarily by radiographic damage (no 
      deterioration in radiographic scores, whatever the instrument used in each trial), 
      and secondarily by functional disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire 
      consistently ≤0.5 and no deterioration), and their combination ("overall good 
      outcome"). Additional analyses will consider longer periods over which to 
      (concurrently) define remission status and outcome (between 1-5y and 1-10y), 
      different cut-offs to define good radiographic outcome (change ≤0.5, ≤3 and ≤5 in 
      radiographic score), sustained remission and the influence of treatment and other 
      clinical factors. DISCUSSION: If 4v-remission and 4v-near-remission are associated 
      with a similar probability of good outcomes, particularly regarding structural 
      damage, the 3v-remission (excluding PGA) could be adopted as the target for 
      immunosuppressive therapy. Patients' perspectives would remain essential, but 
      assessed separately from disease activity, using instruments adequate to guide 
      adjunctive therapies. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO, CRD42017057099.

TI  - Does vitamin D supplementation improve bone density in vitamin D-deficient children? 
      Protocol for an individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - e019584

LID - e019584
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our previous study-level (aggregate data) meta-analysis suggested that 
      vitamin D supplements may be beneficial for bone density specifically in children 
      with vitamin D deficiency. However, the misclassification of vitamin D status 
      inherent in study-level data means that the results are not definitive and cannot 
      provide an accurate assessment of the size of any effect. Therefore, we propose to 
      undertake an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to determine whether the 
      effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone density in children differs according to 
      baseline vitamin D status, and to specifically estimate the effect of vitamin D in 
      children who are vitamin D deficient. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study has been 
      designed to adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
      Meta-Analyses of IPD statement. We will include randomised placebo-controlled trials 
      of vitamin D supplementation reporting bone density outcomes at least 6 months after 
      the study commenced in children and adolescents (aged <20 years) without coexistent 
      medical conditions or treatments causing osteoporosis. We will update the search of 
      the original review to cover the period 2009-2017, using the same methods as the 
      original review. Fully anonymised data on all randomised patients will be requested. 
      Outcomes will be femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine and proximal and distal 
      forearm bone mineral density, and total body bone mineral content. A two-stage IPD 
      meta-analysis will be used to examine the effect of baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin 
      D (25(OH)D) on treatment effect for each bone density outcome. Restricted maximum 
      likelihood will be used to estimate the random-effects meta-analysis models, with 
      95% CI for summary effects. Heterogeneity will be assessed by I(2) and potential 
      publication bias (small-study effects) and availability bias by funnel plots, 
      Egger's test and Peter's test. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval will not be 
      required as the data are to be used for the primary purpose for which they were 
      collected and all original individual studies had ethics approval. Results of the 
      IPD meta-analysis will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics, quality and treatment effects of 
      randomised clinical trials (RCTs) by individual patient data (IPD) availability, in 
      trials eligible for 18 IPD meta-analyses (MA). DESIGN: Trial characteristics, risk 
      of bias (RoB) and hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival were extracted from IPD-MA 
      publications and/or RCTs publications. Data for the RoB assessment were extracted 
      for a subset of 73 RCTs. Two investigators blinded to whether IPD was available or 
      not evaluated the RoB for these trials. Treatment effects were compared using ratios 
      of global HRs (RHRs) of IPD-unavailable trials and IPD-available trials. RHR were 
      pooled using a fixed-effect model. DATA SOURCES: We examined the IPD availability 
      for each trial eligible for each IPD-MA; when the IPD was not available for a trial, 
      we used information from published sources. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING 
      STUDIES: We selected all published IPD-MAs conducted at Gustave Roussy and the RCTs 
      eligible for each. RESULTS: 349 RCTs (73 018 patients) from 18 MAs were eligible: 60 
      RCTs (5890 patients) had unavailable IPD and 289 RCTs (67 128 patients) had 
      available IPD. The main reason for IPD unavailability was data loss by 
      investigators. IPD-unavailable trials were smaller (p<0.001), more often monocentric 
      (p<0.001) and non-international (p=0.0004) than IPD-available trials. Geographical 
      areas differed (p=0.054) between IPD-unavailable IPD-available trials. RoB was 
      higher in IPD-unavailable RCTs for random sequence generation (p=0.007) and 
      allocation concealment (p=0.006). The HR and 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
      overall survival were extractable from publications in 23/60 IPD-unavailable trials 
      included in 10 different MAs. Treatment effects were significantly greater for 
      IPD-unavailable trials compared with IPD-available trials (RHR=0.86 (95% CI 0.75 to 
      0.98)). CONCLUSIONS: IPD-unavailable RCTs were significantly different from 
      IPD-available RCTs in terms of trial characteristics and were at greater RoB. 
      IPD-unavailable RCTs had a significantly greater treatment effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chagas disease is a neglected chronic condition caused by Trypanosoma 
      cruzi, with high prevalence and burden in Latin America. Ventricular arrhythmias are 
      common in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, and amiodarone has been widely used 
      for this purpose. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of amiodarone in 
      patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. METHODOLOGY: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and 
      LILACS up to January 2018. Data from randomized and observational studies evaluating 
      amiodarone use in Chagas cardiomyopathy were included. Two reviewers selected the 
      studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Overall quality of evidence was 
      accessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
      (GRADE). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We included 9 studies (3 before-after studies, 5 case 
      series and 1 randomized controlled trial). Two studies with a total of 38 patients 
      had the full dataset, allowing individual patient data (IPD) analysis. In 24-hour 
      Holter, amiodarone reduced the number of ventricular tachycardia episodes in 99.9% 
      (95%CI 99.8%-100%), ventricular premature beats in 93.1% (95%CI 82%-97.4%) and the 
      incidence of ventricular couplets in 79% (RR 0.21, 95%CI 0.11-0.39). Studies not 
      included in the IPD analysis showed a reduction of ventricular premature beats (5 
      studies), ventricular tachycardia (6 studies) and ventricular couplets (1 study). We 
      pooled the incidence of adverse side effects with random effects meta-analysis; 
      amiodarone was associated with corneal microdeposits (61.1%, 95%CI 19.0-91.3, 5 
      studies), gastrointestinal events (16.1%, 95%CI 6.61-34.2, 3 studies), sinus 
      bradycardia (12.7%, 95%CI 3.71-35.5, 6 studies), dermatological events (10.6%, 95%CI 
      4.77-21.9, 3 studies) and drug discontinuation (7.68%, 95%CI 4.17-13.7, 5 studies). 
      Quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. CONCLUSIONS: Amiodarone is 
      effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias, but there is no evidence for hard 
      endpoints (sudden death, hospitalization). Although our findings support the use of 
      amiodarone, it is important to balance the potential benefits and harms at the 
      individual level for decision-making.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the effect of providing a financial 
      incentive to authors of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to obtain individual 
      patient data (IPD). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Parallel-group RCT with authors 
      identified in the RCTs eligible for two systematic reviews. The authors were 
      randomly allocated to the intervention (financial incentive with several contact 
      approaches) or control group (using the same contact approaches). Studied outcomes 
      are proportion of authors who provided IPD, time to obtain IPD, and completeness of 
      IPD received. RESULTS: Of the 129 authors contacted, 37 authors suggested or 
      contacted a person or funder providing relevant details or showed interest to 
      collaborate, whereas 45 authors directed us to contact a person or funder, lacked 
      resources or time, did not have ownership or approval to share the IPD, or claimed 
      IPD was too old. None of the authors shared their IPD. We contacted 17 sponsors and 
      received two complete IPD datasets from one sponsor. The time to obtain IPD was 
      >1 year after a sponsor's positive response. Common barriers included study 
      identification, data ownership, limited data access, and required IPD licenses. 
      CONCLUSION: IPD sharing may depend on study characteristics, including funding type, 
      study size, study risk of bias, and treatment effect, but not on providing a 
      financial incentive.

TI  - The hierarchical metaregression approach and learning from clinical evidence.
PG  - 535-557
LID - 10.1002/bimj.201700266 [doi]
AB  - The hierarchical metaregression (HMR) approach is a multiparameter Bayesian approach 
      for meta-analysis, which generalizes the standard mixed effects models by explicitly 
      modeling the data collection process in the meta-analysis. The HMR allows to 
      investigate the potential external validity of experimental results as well as to 
      assess the internal validity of the studies included in a systematic review. The HMR 
      automatically identifies studies presenting conflicting evidence and it downweights 
      their influence in the meta-analysis. In addition, the HMR allows to perform 
      cross-evidence synthesis, which combines aggregated results from randomized 
      controlled trials to predict effectiveness in a single-arm observational study with 
      individual participant data (IPD). In this paper, we evaluate the HMR approach using 
      simulated data examples. We present a new real case study in diabetes research, 
      along with a new R package called jarbes (just a rather Bayesian evidence 
      synthesis), which automatizes the complex computations involved in the HMR.

PG  - 589

AB  - Background: Negative effects of psychological treatments have recently received 
      increased attention in both research and clinical practice. Most investigations have 
      focused on determining the occurrence and characteristics of deterioration and other 
      adverse and unwanted events, such as interpersonal issues, indicating that patients 
      quite frequently experience such incidents in treatment. However, non-response is 
      also negative if it might have prolonged an ongoing condition and caused unnecessary 
      suffering. Yet few attempts have been made to directly explore non-response in 
      psychological treatment or its plausible causes. Internet-based cognitive behavior 
      therapy (ICBT) has been found effective for a number of diagnoses but has not yet 
      been systematically explored with regard to those patients who do not respond. 
      Methods: The current study collected and aggregated data from 2,866 patients in 29 
      clinical randomized trials of ICBT for three categories of diagnoses: anxiety 
      disorders, depression, and other (erectile dysfunction, relationship problems, and 
      gambling disorder). Raw scores from each patient variable were used in an individual 
      patient data meta-analysis to determine the rate of non-response on the primary 
      outcome measure for each clinical trial, while its potential predictors were 
      examined using binomial logistic regression. The reliable change index (RCI) was 
      used to classify patients as non-responders. Results: Of the 2,118 patients 
      receiving treatment, and when applying a RCI of z ≥ 1.96, 567 (26.8%) were 
      classified as non-responders. In terms of predictors, patients with higher symptom 
      severity on the primary outcome measure at baseline, Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.04, having 
      a primary anxiety disorder (OR = 5.75), and being of male gender (OR = 1.80), might 
      have higher odds of not responding to treatment. Conclusion: Non-response seems to 
      occur among approximately a quarter of all patients in ICBT, with predictors related 
      to greater symptoms, anxiety disorders, and gender indicating increasing the odds of 
      not responding. However, the results need to be replicated before establishing their 
      clinical relevance, and the use of the RCI as a way of determining non-response 
      needs to be validated by other means, such as by interviewing patients classified as 
      non-responders.

      Implantation in Elderly Patients: A Meta-Analysis of Individual Participant Data

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet 
      therapy (DAPT) after the implantation of a drug-eluting stent (DES) in elderly 
      patients. BACKGROUND: Qualified studies to evaluate the optimal duration of DAPT in 
      elderly patients have been very limited. METHODS: Using 6 randomized trials that 
      compared short-term (≤6 months) and long-term (12 months) DAPT, individual 
      participant data meta-analysis was performed in elderly patients (≥65 years of age). 
      The primary study outcome was the 12-month risk of a composite of myocardial 
      infarction, definite or probable stent thrombosis, or stroke. The major secondary 
      outcome was the 12-month risk of major bleeding. RESULTS: The primary outcome risk 
      did not significantly differ between patients receiving short-term and long-term 
      DAPT (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88 to 1.43; p = 
      0.3581) in the overall group of study participants. In subgroup analysis, a 
      significant interaction between age and DAPT duration was observed for primary 
      outcome risk (p for interaction = 0.0384). In the subset of younger patients (<65 
      years of age, n = 6,152), short-term DAPT was associated with higher risk of primary 
      outcome (HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.44; p = 0.0082). In elderly patients (n = 
      5,319), however, the risk of primary outcome did not significantly differ between 
      patients receiving short-term and long-term DAPT (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.16; 
      p = 0.2856). Short-term DAPT was associated with a significant reduction in major 
      bleeding compared with long-term DAPT (HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.84; p = 0.0081) 
      in the overall group, and particularly in elderly patients (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 
      0.24-0.88; p = 0.0196). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term DAPT after new-generation DES 
      implantation may be more beneficial in elderly patients than in younger patients.

TI  - Renal replacement therapy intensity for acute kidney injury and recovery to dialysis 
      independence: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 1017-1024
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfx308 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no consensus whether higher intensity dose renal replacement 
      therapy (RRT) compared with standard intensity RRT has survival benefit and achieves 
      better renal recovery in acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: In an individual 
      patient data meta-analysis, we merged individual patient data from randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) comparing high with standard intensity RRT in intensive 
      care unit patients with severe AKI. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The 
      secondary outcome was renal recovery assessed as the proportion of patients who were 
      RRT dependent at key trial endpoints and by time to the end of RRT dependence. 
      RESULTS: Of the eight prospective RCTs assessing different RRT intensities, seven 
      contributed individual patient data (n = 3682) to the analysis. Mortality was 
      similar between the two groups at 28 days [769/1884 (40.8%) and 744/1798 (41.4%), 
      respectively; P = 0.40] after randomization. However, more participants assigned to 
      higher intensity therapy remained RRT dependent at the most common key study point 
      of 28 days [e.g. 292/983 (29.7%) versus 235/943 (24.9%); relative risk 1.15 (95% 
      confidence interval 1.00-1.33); P = 0.05]. Time to cessation of RRT through 28 days 
      was longer in patients receiving higher intensity RRT (log-rank test P = 0.02) and 
      when continuous renal replacement therapy was used as the initial modality of RRT 
      (log-rank test P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In severe AKI patients, higher intensity RRT 
      does not affect mortality but appears to delay renal recovery. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Cardiovascular safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist taspoglutide

      randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 505-10
LID - 10.1111/dom.12448 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To study the short-term cardiovascular effects of the once-weekly 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist taspoglutide. METHODS: We conducted a 
      meta-analysis of individual-participant data from nine randomized controlled trials 
      in the T-Emerge programme, which assessed the efficacy and safety of taspoglutide in 
      type 2 diabetes. Our primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular 
      disease (CVD) and acute myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalization for 
      unstable angina. RESULTS: Overall, 7056 individuals were included in the analysis, 
      and there were 67 primary endpoint events during 7478 person-years of follow-up (40 
      vs 27 events in the intervention vs control groups, respectively). The odds ratio 
      for the composite endpoint among people randomized to taspoglutide was 0.94 (95% 
      confidence interval 0.57-1.56), which was robust across multiple subgroups. 
      Longer-term data were not available as the development of taspoglutide was stopped 
      because of gastrointestinal intolerance and serious hypersensitivity reactions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The available data suggest that short-term, once-weekly administration 
      of taspoglutide was not associated with an excess risk of CVD, and provide insights 
      relevant to the development of other novel once-weekly incretin mimetics.

AB  - A meta-analysis was conducted of individual patient data (n = 3292) from three 
      randomized controlled trials of corifollitropin alfa versus rFSH: Engage (150 µg 
      corifollitropin alfa n = 756; 200 IU rFSH n = 750), Ensure (100 µg corifollitropin 
      alfa n = 268; 150 IU rFSH n = 128), and Pursue (150 µg corifollitropin alfa n = 694; 
      300 IU rFSH n = 696). Women with regular menstrual cycles aged 18-36 and body weight 
      >60 kg (Engage) or ≤60 kg (Ensure), or women aged 35-42 years and body weight ≥50 kg 
      (Pursue), received a single injection (100 µg or 150 µg) of corifollitropin alfa 
      (based on body weight and age) or daily rFSH. The difference (corifollitropin alfa 
      minus rFSH) in the number of oocytes retrieved was +1.0 (95% CI: 0.5-1.5); vital 
      pregnancy rate: -2.2% (95% CI: -5.3%-0.9%); ongoing pregnancy rate: -1.7% (95% CI: 
      -4.7%-1.4%); and live birth rate: -2.0% (95% CI: -5.0%-1.1%). The odds ratio for 
      overall OHSS was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.82-1.61), and for moderate-to-severe OHSS: 1.29 
      (95% CI: 0.81-2.05). A single dose of corifollitropin alfa for the first 7 days of 
      ovarian stimulation is a generally well-tolerated and similarly effective treatment 
      compared with daily rFSH.

AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a promising new 
      treatment for major depression. While recent randomised, sham-controlled studies 
      found tDCS to have antidepressant effects, it remains to be determined whether a 
      tDCS treatment course may also enhance cognitive function independent of mood 
      effects in depressed patients. This systematic review and individual patient data 
      (IPD) meta-analysis examined cognitive outcomes from randomised, sham-controlled 
      trials of tDCS treatment for major depression. Seven randomised, sham-controlled 
      trials (n = 478 participants, 260 in active and 218 in sham) of tDCS for major 
      depression were included. Results showed no cognitive enhancement after active tDCS 
      compared to sham for the 12 cognitive outcomes investigated. Active relative to sham 
      tDCS treatment was associated with reduced performance gains on a measure of 
      processing speed (β = -0.33, 95% CI -0.58; -0.08, p = 0.011). Active tDCS treatment 
      for depression did not show cognitive benefits independent of mood effects. Rather, 
      tDCS treatment relative to sham stimulation for major depression may instead be 
      associated with a reduced practice effect for processing speed.

TI  - No evidence of neurocognitive adverse events associated with alirocumab treatment in 
      3340 patients from 14 randomized Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials: a meta-analysis of 
      individual patient data.
PG  - 374-381
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehx661 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Despite patient reports of neurocognitive disorders with lipid-lowering 
      treatments (LLTs), large clinical trials have found no significant association 
      between neurocognitive disorders and LLTs. We assessed incidence of neurocognitive 
      treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from 14 Phase 2 and 3 trials of the 
      proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor alirocumab. METHODS 
      AND RESULTS: Patients (most on background maximally tolerated statin) received 
      alirocumab 75/150 mg every 2 weeks (n = 3340; 4029 patient-years of exposure), 
      placebo (n = 1276), or ezetimibe (n = 618). Data were pooled by the control used. 
      Neurocognitive TEAEs were reported by 22 (0.9%) alirocumab-treated patients vs. 9 
      (0.7%) with placebo in placebo-controlled trials [hazard ratio (HR) 1.24, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.57-2.68] and 10 (1.2%) with alirocumab vs. 8 (1.3%) with 
      ezetimibe in ezetimibe-controlled trials (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.32-2.08). Rates of 
      neurocognitive TEAEs were similar in patients receiving alirocumab with LDL 
      cholesterol (LDL-C) levels <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L; n = 5/839; 0.6%; 0.5/100 
      patient-years) vs. ≥25 mg/dL (n = 26/2501; 1.0%; 0.8/100 patient-years). One patient 
      (0.1%; ezetimibe-controlled pool) receiving alirocumab had a neurocognitive TEAE 
      leading to discontinuation vs. two (0.2%) patients receiving placebo and three 
      (0.4%) patients receiving ezetimibe. Neurocognitive TEAE incidence was also similar 
      between alirocumab and controls when stratified by age. CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive 
      TEAE incidences were low (≤1.2%), with no significant differences between alirocumab 
      vs. controls up to 104 weeks. No association was found between neurocognitive TEAEs 
      and LDL-C <25 mg/dL based on the completed Phase 2 and 3 trials examined, although 
      long-term effects of very low LDL-C levels induced by PCSK9 inhibitors are currently 
      unknown.

TI  - Prenatal administration of progestogens for preventing spontaneous preterm birth in 
      women with a multiple pregnancy.
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD012024.pub3 [doi]
LID - CD012024
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple pregnancy is a strong risk factor for preterm birth, and more 
      than 50% of women with a twin pregnancy will give birth prior to 37 weeks' 
      gestation. Infants born preterm are recognised to be at increased risk of many 
      adverse health outcomes, contributing to more than half of overall perinatal 
      mortality. Progesterone is produced naturally in the body and has a role in 
      maintaining pregnancy, although it is not clear whether administering progestogens 
      to women with multiple pregnancy at high risk of early birth is effective and safe. 
      Since publication of this new review in Issue 10, 2017, we have now moved one study 
      (El-Refaie 2016) from included to studies awaiting classification, pending 
      clarification about the study data. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of 
      progesterone administration for the prevention of preterm birth in women with a 
      multiple pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and 
      Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International 
      Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 November 2016) and reference lists of 
      retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials 
      examining the administration of a progestogen by any route for the prevention of 
      preterm birth in women with multiple pregnancy. We did not include quasi-randomised 
      or cross-over studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors 
      independently assessed reports identified by the search for eligibility, extracted 
      data, assessed risk of bias and graded the quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We 
      included 16 trials, which all compared either vaginal or intramuscular (IM) 
      progesterone with a placebo or no treatment, and involved a total of 4548 women. The 
      risk of bias for the majority of included studies was low, with the exception of 
      three studies that had inadequate blinding, or significant loss to follow-up or 
      both, or were not reported well enough for us to make a judgement. We graded the 
      evidence low to high quality, with downgrading for statistical heterogeneity, design 
      limitations in some of the studies contributing data, and imprecision of the effect 
      estimate. 1 IM progesterone versus no treatment or placebo More women delivered at 
      less than 34 weeks' gestation in the IM progesterone group compared with placebo 
      (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 2.26; women = 399; 
      studies = 2; low-quality evidence). Although the incidence of perinatal death in the 
      progesterone group was higher, there was considerable uncertainty around the effect 
      estimate and high heterogeneity between studies (average RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.60 to 
      3.51; infants = 3089; studies = 6; I(2) = 71%; low-quality evidence). No studies 
      reported maternal mortality or major neurodevelopmental disability at childhood 
      follow-up. There were no clear group differences found in any of the other maternal 
      or infant outcomes (preterm birth less than 37 weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; 
      women = 2010; studies = 5; high-quality evidence); preterm birth less than 28 weeks 
      (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.55; women = 1920; studies = 5; moderate-quality 
      evidence); infant birthweight less than 2500 g (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.08; 
      infants = 4071; studies = 5; I(2) = 76%, moderate-quality evidence)). No childhood 
      outcomes were reported in the trials. 2 Vaginal progesterone versus no treatment or 
      placebo by dose There were no clear group differences in incidence of preterm birth 
      before 34 weeks (average RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.23; women = 1503; studies = 5; 
      I(2) = 36%; low-quality evidence). Although fewer births before 34 weeks appeared to 
      occur in the progesterone group, the CIs crossed the line of no effect. Incidence of 
      perinatal death was higher in the progesterone group, although there was 
      considerable uncertainty in the effect estimate and the quality of the evidence was 
      low for this outcome (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.06; infants = 2287; studies = 3; 
      low-quality evidence). No studies reported maternal mortality or major 
      neurodevelopmental disability at childhood follow-up. There were no clear group 
      differences found in any of the other maternal or infant outcomes (preterm birth 
      less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.06; women = 1597; studies = 6; 
      moderate-quality evidence); preterm birth less than 28 weeks (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.79 
      to 2.97; women = 1345; studies = 3; low-quality evidence); infant birthweight less 
      than 2500 g (average RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07; infants = 2640; studies = 3; I(2) 
      = 66%, moderate-quality evidence)). No childhood outcomes were reported in the 
      trials. For secondary outcomes, there were no clear group differences found in any 
      of the other maternal outcomes except for caesarean section, where women who 
      received vaginal progesterone did not have as many caesarean sections as those in 
      the placebo group, although the difference between groups was not large (8%) (RR 
      0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.98; women = 1919; studies = 5; I(2) = 0%). There were no 
      clear group differences found in any of the infant outcomes except for mechanical 
      ventilation, which was required by fewer infants whose mothers had received the 
      vaginal progesterone (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94; infants = 2695; studies = 4). 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, for women with a multiple pregnancy, the 
      administration of progesterone (either IM or vaginal) does not appear to be 
      associated with a reduction in risk of preterm birth or improved neonatal outcomes. 
      Future research could focus on a comprehensive individual participant data 
      meta-analysis including all of the available data relating to both IM and vaginal 
      progesterone administration in women with a multiple pregnancy, before considering 
      the need to conduct trials in subgroups of high-risk women (for example, women with 
      a multiple pregnancy and a short cervical length identified on ultrasound).

TI  - Initial severity and antidepressant efficacy for anxiety disorders, 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder: An individual 
      patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 515-522
LID - 10.1002/da.22737 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that antidepressant benefits are smaller for mild 
      than severe depression. Because antidepressants are also used for anxiety disorders, 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we 
      examined the influence of severity for these disorders. METHODS: We used individual 
      patient data of eight trials (3,430 participants) for generalized anxiety disorder 
      (GAD); four trials (1,195 participants) for social anxiety disorder (SAD); four 
      trials (1,132 participants) for OCD; three trials (1,071 participants) for PTSD; and 
      10 trials (2,151 participants) for panic disorder (PD). Mixed-effects models were 
      used to investigate an interaction between severity and treatment group. RESULTS: 
      For GAD and PD, severity moderated antidepressant efficacy. The 
      antidepressant-placebo difference was 1.4 (95% CI: 0.4-2.5; SMD: 0.21) Hamilton 
      Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) points for participants with mild GAD (baseline 
      HAM-A = 10), increasing to 4.0 (3.4-4.6; SMD: 0.45) or greater for severely ill 
      participants (HAM-A ≥ 30). For PD, the difference was 0.4 (0.3-0.6) panic 
      attacks/2 weeks for participants with 10 panic attacks/2 weeks at baseline, 
      increasing to 4.7 (3.0-6.4) for participants with 40. For SAD, OCD, and PTSD, no 
      interaction was found. Across severity levels, the differences were 16.1 (12.9-19.3; 
      SMD: 0.59) Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale points, 3.4 (2.5-4.4, SMD: 0.39) 
      Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale points, and 10.3 (6.9-13.6; SMD: 0.41) 
      Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale points. CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressants are equally 
      effective across severity levels for SAD, OCD, and PTSD. For GAD and PD, however, 
      benefits are small at low severity, and the benefit-risk ratio may be unfavorable 
      for these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extra-corporeal life support (ECLS) is a life-saving intervention for 
      patients with hypothermia induced cardiac arrest or severe cardiovascular 
      instability. However, its application is highly variable due to a paucity of data in 
      the literature to guide practice. Current guidelines and recommendations are based 
      on expert opinion, single case reports, and small case series. Combining all of the 
      published data in a patient-level analysis can provide a robust assessment of the 
      influence of patient characteristics on survival with ECLS. OBJECTIVE: To develop a 
      prediction model of survival with good neurologic outcome for accidental hypothermia 
      treated with ECLS. METHODS: Electronic searches of PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL were 
      conducted with a hand search of reference lists and major surgical and critical care 
      conference abstracts. Studies had to report the use of ECLS configured with a 
      circuit, blood pump and oxygenator with an integrated heat exchanger. Randomized and 
      observational studies were eligible for inclusion. Non-human, non-English and review 
      manuscripts were deemed ineligible. Study authors were requested to submit patient 
      level data when aggregate or incomplete individual patient data was provided in a 
      study. Survival with good neurologic outcome was categorized for patients to last 
      follow-up based on the reported scores on the Cerebral Performance Category (1 or 
      2), Glasgow Outcome Scale (4 or 5) and Pediatric Overall Performance Category (1 or 
      2). A one-stage, individual patient data meta-analysis was performed with a 
      mixed-effects multi-level logistic regression model reporting odds ratio (OR) with a 
      95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Data from 44 observational studies and 40 
      case reports (n = 658) were combined and analyzed to identify independent predictors 
      of survival with good neurologic outcome. The survival rate with good neurologic 
      outcome of the entire cohort was 40.3% (265 of 658). ECLS rewarming rate (OR: 0.93; 
      95% CI: 0.88, 0.98; p = .007), female gender (OR: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.69, 4.58; 
      p < 0.001), asphyxiation (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.35; p < 0.001) and serum 
      potassium (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.73; p < 0.001) were associated with survival 
      with a good neurologic outcome. The logistic regression model demonstrated excellent 
      discrimination (c-statistic: 0.849; 95% CI: 0.823, 0.875). CONCLUSIONS: The use of 
      extracorporeal life support in the treatment of hypothermic cardiac arrest provides 
      a favourable chance of survival with good neurologic outcome. When used in a 
      weighted scoring system, asphyxiation, serum potassium and gender can help 
      clinicians prognosticate the benefit of resuscitating hypothermic patients with 
      ECLS.

AB  - The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration was originally established 
      to conduct individual participant data meta-analyses of major vascular events, 
      cause-specific mortality, and site-specific cancers in large, long-term, randomized 
      trials of statin therapy (and other cholesterol-modifying treatments). The results 
      of the trials of statin therapy and their associated meta-analyses have shown that 
      statins significantly reduce the risk of major vascular events without any increase 
      in the risk of nonvascular causes of death or of site-specific cancer, but do 
      produce small increases in the incidence of myopathy, diabetes, and, probably, 
      hemorrhagic stroke. The CTT Collaboration has not previously sought data on other 
      outcomes, and so a comprehensive meta-analysis of all adverse events recorded in 
      each of the eligible trials has not been conducted. This protocol prospectively 
      describes plans to extend the CTT meta-analysis data set so as to provide a more 
      complete understanding of the nature and magnitude of any other effects of statin 
      therapy.

TI  - 'Arm-based' parameterization for network meta-analysis.
PG  - 306-13
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1187 [doi]
AB  - We present an alternative to the contrast-based parameterization used in a number of 
      publications for network meta-analysis. This alternative "arm-based" 
      parameterization offers a number of advantages: it allows for a "long" normalized 
      data structure that remains constant regardless of the number of comparators; it can 
      be used to directly incorporate individual patient data into the analysis; the 
      incorporation of multi-arm trials is straightforward and avoids the need to generate 
      a multivariate distribution describing treatment effects; there is a direct mapping 
      between the parameterization and the analysis script in languages such as WinBUGS 
      and finally, the arm-based parameterization allows simple extension to 
      treatment-specific random treatment effect variances. We validated the 
      parameterization using a published smoking cessation dataset. Network meta-analysis 
      using arm- and contrast-based parameterizations produced comparable results (with 
      means and standard deviations being within +/- 0.01) for both fixed and random 
      effects models. We recommend that analysts consider using arm-based parameterization 
      when carrying out network meta-analyses. © 2015 The Authors Research Synthesis

AB  - Sharing metadata, individual participant data and summary data, as a complement to 
      results dissemination and trial registration requirements, is perceived to be 
      advantageous by enabling faster and more accurate meta-analyses and reducing the 
      need for additional trials. To date, various models of data access have been 
      utilized in order to manage clinical trials data sharing and access in line with the 
      rights and interests of sponsors, researchers and patients involved in clinical 
      trials. In order to ensure responsible data sharing, the data access review process 
      should be developed in a way that ensures fairness, transparency and objectivity. In 
      this article, we critically review some examples of current governance models in 
      clinical trials data sharing and suggest approaches to ensure the objectivity of the 
      data access review process.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate how individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses have 
      impacted directly on the design and conduct of trials and highlight other advantages 
      IPD might offer. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Potential examples of the impact of IPD 
      meta-analyses on trials were identified at an international workshop, attended by 
      individuals with experience in the conduct of IPD meta-analyses and knowledge of 
      trials in their respective clinical areas. Experts in the field who did not attend 
      were asked to provide any further examples. We then examined relevant trial 
      protocols, publications, and Web sites to verify the impacts of the IPD 
      meta-analyses. A subgroup of workshop attendees sought further examples and 
      identified other aspects of trial design and conduct that may inform IPD 
      meta-analyses. RESULTS: We identified 52 examples of IPD meta-analyses thought to 
      have had a direct impact on the design or conduct of trials. After screening 
      relevant trial protocols and publications, we identified 28 instances where IPD 
      meta-analyses had clearly impacted on trials. They have influenced the selection of 
      comparators and participants, sample size calculations, analysis and interpretation 
      of subsequent trials, and the conduct and analysis of ongoing trials, sometimes in 
      ways that would not possible with systematic reviews of aggregate data. We 
      identified additional potential ways that IPD meta-analyses could be used to 
      influence trials. CONCLUSIONS: IPD meta-analysis could be better used to inform the 
      design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of trials.

TI  - Vaginal progesterone pessaries for pregnant women with a previous preterm birth to 
      prevent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (the PROGRESS Study): A multicentre, 
      randomised, placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, as a consequence of preterm 
      birth, is a major cause of early mortality and morbidity. The withdrawal of 
      progesterone, either actual or functional, is thought to be an antecedent to the 
      onset of labour. There remains limited information on clinically relevant health 
      outcomes as to whether vaginal progesterone may be of benefit for pregnant women 
      with a history of a previous preterm birth, who are at high risk of a recurrence. 
      Our primary aim was to assess whether the use of vaginal progesterone pessaries in 
      women with a history of previous spontaneous preterm birth reduced the risk and 
      severity of respiratory distress syndrome in their infants, with secondary aims of 
      examining the effects on other neonatal morbidities and maternal health and 
      assessing the adverse effects of treatment. METHODS: Women with a live singleton or 
      twin pregnancy between 18 to <24 weeks' gestation and a history of prior preterm 
      birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation in the preceding pregnancy, where labour 
      occurred spontaneously or in association with cervical incompetence or following 
      preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, were eligible. Women were recruited from 
      39 Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian maternity hospitals and assigned by 
      randomisation to vaginal progesterone pessaries (equivalent to 100 mg vaginal 
      progesterone) (n = 398) or placebo (n = 389). Participants and investigators were 
      masked to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was respiratory distress 
      syndrome and severity. Secondary outcomes were other respiratory morbidities; other 
      adverse neonatal outcomes; adverse outcomes for the woman, especially related to 
      preterm birth; and side effects of progesterone treatment. Data were analysed for 
      all the 787 women (100%) randomised and their 799 infants. FINDINGS: Most women used 
      their allocated study treatment (740 women, 94.0%), with median use similar for both 
      study groups (51.0 days, interquartile range [IQR] 28.0-69.0, in the progesterone 
      group versus 52.0 days, IQR 27.0-76.0, in the placebo group). The incidence of 
      respiratory distress syndrome was similar in both study groups-10.5% (42/402) in the 
      progesterone group and 10.6% (41/388) in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk 
      [RR] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-1.49, p = 0.912)-as was the severity of 
      any neonatal respiratory disease (adjusted treatment effect 1.02, 95% CI 0.69-1.53, 
      p = 0.905). No differences were seen between study groups for other respiratory 
      morbidities and adverse infant outcomes, including serious infant composite outcome 
      (155/406 [38.2%] in the progesterone group and 152/393 [38.7%] in the placebo group, 
      adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82-1.17, p = 0.798). The proportion of infants born 
      before 37 weeks' gestation was similar in both study groups (148/406 [36.5%] in the 
      progesterone group and 146/393 [37.2%] in the placebo group, adjusted RR 0.97, 95% 
      CI 0.81-1.17, p = 0.765). A similar proportion of women in both study groups had 
      maternal morbidities, especially those related to preterm birth, or experienced side 
      effects of treatment. In 9.9% (39/394) of the women in the progesterone group and 
      7.3% (28/382) of the women in the placebo group, treatment was stopped because of 
      side effects (adjusted RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.85-2.15, p = 0.204). The main limitation of 
      the study was that almost 9% of the women did not start the medication or forgot to 
      use it 3 or more times a week. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the use of 
      vaginal progesterone pessaries in women with a history of a previous spontaneous 
      preterm birth to reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome or other 
      neonatal and maternal morbidities related to preterm birth. Individual participant 
      data meta-analysis of the relevant trials may identify specific women for whom 
      vaginal progesterone might be of benefit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Clinical 
      Trials ISRCTN20269066.

TI  - Clinicopathological factors influencing outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer 
      patients treated with fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab maintenance treatment vs 
      observation: an individual patient data meta-analysis of two phase 3 trials.
PG  - 1768-1776
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2017.382 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The CAIRO3 and AIO 0207 trials demonstrated the efficacy of 
      fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab (FP+Bev) maintenance treatment in metastatic 
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. In this individual patient data meta-analysis 
      with updated follow-up, we aim to provide more precise estimates of treatment 
      effects and to identify subgroups that benefit most from maintenance treatment or 
      observation. METHODS: In 871 patients, randomised to FP+Bev maintenance treatment or 
      observation, we investigated whether treatment effect was modified by sex, age, 
      performance status, response to induction treatment, primary tumour location, number 
      of metastatic sites, disease stage and primary tumour resection, serum LDH, platelet 
      count, CEA, and RAS/BRAF mutation status. Primary end point was time to second 
      progression after reintroduction of the induction regimen (PFS2). Secondary end 
      points were first progression-free survival (PFS1) and overall survival (OS). 
      RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 68.5 months (IQR 54.6-87.0 months), maintenance 
      treatment was more effective compared with observation in PFS1 (HR 0.40(95% CI 
      0.34-0.47)) and PFS2 (HR 0.70(0.60-0.81)). No subgroups were identified that did not 
      benefit from maintenance treatment in PFS1 and PFS2; no clinically relevant subgroup 
      effects were observed. Regarding OS, pooled results were not significant (HR 
      0.91(0.78-1.05)), and the trials showed marked heterogeneity in overall treatment 
      effect and subgroup effects. CONCLUSIONS: FP+Bev maintenance treatment is effective 
      in all patients, regardless of the investigated subgroups.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to assess trial-level factors associated 
      with the contribution of individual participant data (IPD) to IPD meta-analyses, and 
      to quantify the data availability bias, namely the difference between the effect 
      estimates of trials contributing IPD and those not contributing IPD in the same 
      systematic reviews (SRs). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We included SRs of randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) with IPD meta-analyses since 2011. We extracted trial-level 
      characteristics and examined their association with IPD contribution. To assess the 
      data availability bias, we retrieved odds ratios from the original RCT articles, 
      calculated the ratio of odds ratios (RORs) between aggregate data (AD) meta-analyses 
      of RCTs contributing IPD and those of RCTs not contributing IPD for each SR, and 
      meta-analytically synthesized RORs. RESULTS: Of 728 eligible RCTs included in 31 
      SRs, 321 (44%) contributed IPD, whereas 407 (56%) did not. A recent publication 
      year, larger number of participants, adequate allocation concealment, and impact 
      factor ≥10 were associated with IPD contribution. We found the SRs yielded widely 
      different estimates of RORs. Overall, there was no significant difference in the 
      pooled effect estimates of AD meta-analyses between RCTs contributing and not 
      contributing IPD (ROR 1.01, 95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.19). CONCLUSIONS: There 
      was no consistent evidence of a data availability bias in recent IPD meta-analyses 
      of RCTs with dichotomous outcomes. Higher methodological qualities of trials were 
      associated with IPD contribution.

      and postoperative ARDS: an individual patient data meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transfusion of blood products and mechanical ventilation with injurious 
      settings are considered risk factors for postoperative lung injury in surgical 
      Patients. METHODS: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis was 
      done to determine the independent effects of peri-operative transfusion of blood 
      products, intra-operative tidal volume and airway pressure in adult patients 
      undergoing mechanical ventilation for general surgery, as well as their interactions 
      on the occurrence of postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
      Observational studies and randomized trials were identified by a systematic search 
      of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and CENTRAL and screened for inclusion into a 
      meta-analysis. Individual patient data were obtained from the corresponding authors. 
      Patients were stratified according to whether they received transfusion in the 
      peri-operative period [red blood cell concentrates (RBC) and/or fresh frozen plasma 
      (FFP)], tidal volume size [≤7 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW), 7-10 and >10 mL/kg 
      PBW] and airway pressure level used during surgery (≤15, 15-20 and >20 cmH(2)O). The 
      primary outcome was development of postoperative ARDS. RESULTS: Seventeen 
      investigations were included (3,659 patients). Postoperative ARDS occurred in 40 
      (7.2%) patients who received at least one blood product compared to 40 patients 
      (2.5%) who did not [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 2.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
      1.25-4.33; P=0.008]. Incidence of postoperative ARDS was highest in patients 
      ventilated with tidal volumes of >10 mL/kg PBW and having airway pressures of >20 
      cmH(2)O receiving both RBC and FFP, and lowest in patients ventilated with tidal 
      volume of ≤7 mL/kg PBW and having airway pressures of ≤15 cmH(2)O with no 
      transfusion. There was a significant interaction between transfusion and airway 
      pressure level (P=0.002) on the risk of postoperative ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Peri-operative transfusion of blood products is associated with an increased risk of 
      postoperative ARDS, which seems more dependent on airway pressure than tidal volume 
      size.

TI  - Causes and Solutions of Endovascular Treatment Failure.
PG  - 131-142
LID - 10.5853/jos.2017.00283 [doi]
AB  - In a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 5 randomized controlled trials, 
      endovascular treatment (EVT) mainly using a stent retriever achieved successful 
      recanalization in 71.1% of patients suffering from acute stroke due to anterior 
      circulation large artery occlusion (LAO). However, EVT still failed in 28.9% of LAO 
      cases in those 5 successful trials. Stent retriever failure may occur due to 
      anatomical challenges (e.g., a tortuous arterial tree from the aortic arch to a 
      target occlusion site), a large quantity of clots, tandem occlusion, clot 
      characteristics (fresh versus organized clots), different pathomechanisms (embolic 
      versus non-embolic occlusion), etc. Given that recanalization success is the most 
      important factor in the neurological outcome of acute stroke patients, it is 
      important to seek solutions for such difficult cases. In this review, the basic 
      technique of EVT is briefly summarized and then various difficult cases with diverse 
      conditions are discussed along with suggested solutions.

TI  - Transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus surgery for symptomatic severe aortic 
      stenosis: A reconstructed individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 158-166
LID - 10.1002/ccd.28504 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We wished to undertake a reconstructed individual patient data 
      meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing transcatheter aortic valve 
      replacement (TAVR) and surgery for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. 
      BACKGROUND: TAVR and surgery are both well-established methods for treating patients 
      with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are at low, intermediate, and high risk 
      for surgery. METHODS: Data were identified by searches of Medline, Embase, CENTRAL 
      and ClinicalTrials.gov for all randomized clinical trials, which compared TAVR and 
      surgery that had published at least 1 year of follow-up. Individual patient data 
      were reconstructed from Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: A total of 7,770 patients from 
      seven randomized clinical trials were included in this meta-analysis. At 1 year, 
      TAVR was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause (hazard ratio [HR], 
      0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.98; p = .03), disabling stroke (HR, 0.71; 
      95% CI, 0.54-0.93; p = .01) and the composite end point of death or disabling stroke 
      (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67-0.92; p = .002). Significant interactions were found for 
      access suitability, with TAVR associated with a lower risk of these end points in 
      patients suitable for transfemoral access. TAVR was associated with a lower risk of 
      periprocedural events, whereas the risk of late events was similar between TAVR and 
      surgery. CONCLUSIONS: At 1 year, TAVR was associated with a lower risk of death, 
      disabling stroke and the composite end point, when compared with surgery. These 
      associations were strongest within the subgroup of patients in whom transfemoral 
      access was feasible.

TI  - Dealing with missing standard deviation and mean values in meta-analysis of 
      continuous outcomes: a systematic review.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s12874-018-0483-0 [doi]
LID - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rigorous, informative meta-analyses rely on availability of appropriate 
      summary statistics or individual participant data. For continuous outcomes, 
      especially those with naturally skewed distributions, summary information on the 
      mean or variability often goes unreported. While full reporting of original trial 
      data is the ideal, we sought to identify methods for handling unreported mean or 
      variability summary statistics in meta-analysis. METHODS: We undertook two 
      systematic literature reviews to identify methodological approaches used to deal 
      with missing mean or variability summary statistics. Five electronic databases were 
      searched, in addition to the Cochrane Colloquium abstract books and the Cochrane 
      Statistics Methods Group mailing list archive. We also conducted cited reference 
      searching and emailed topic experts to identify recent methodological developments. 
      Details recorded included the description of the method, the information required to 
      implement the method, any underlying assumptions and whether the method could be 
      readily applied in standard statistical software. We provided a summary description 
      of the methods identified, illustrating selected methods in example meta-analysis 
      scenarios. RESULTS: For missing standard deviations (SDs), following screening of 
      503 articles, fifteen methods were identified in addition to those reported in a 
      previous review. These included Bayesian hierarchical modelling at the meta-analysis 
      level; summary statistic level imputation based on observed SD values from other 
      trials in the meta-analysis; a practical approximation based on the range; and 
      algebraic estimation of the SD based on other summary statistics. Following 
      screening of 1124 articles for methods estimating the mean, one approximate Bayesian 
      computation approach and three papers based on alternative summary statistics were 
      identified. Illustrative meta-analyses showed that when replacing a missing SD the 
      approximation using the range minimised loss of precision and generally performed 
      better than omitting trials. When estimating missing means, a formula using the 
      median, lower quartile and upper quartile performed best in preserving the precision 
      of the meta-analysis findings, although in some scenarios, omitting trials gave 
      superior results. CONCLUSIONS: Methods based on summary statistics (minimum, 
      maximum, lower quartile, upper quartile, median) reported in the literature 
      facilitate more comprehensive inclusion of randomised controlled trials with missing 
      mean or variability summary statistics within meta-analyses.

TI  - Identifying inconsistency in network meta-analysis: Is the net heat plot a reliable 
      method?
PG  - 5547-5564
LID - 10.1002/sim.8383 [doi]
AB  - One of the biggest challenges for network meta-analysis is inconsistency, which 
      occurs when the direct and indirect evidence conflict. Inconsistency causes problems 
      for the estimation and interpretation of treatment effects and treatment contrasts. 
      Krahn and colleagues proposed the net heat approach as a graphical tool for 
      identifying and locating inconsistency within a network of randomized controlled 
      trials. For networks with a treatment loop, the net heat plot displays statistics 
      calculated by temporarily removing each design one at a time, in turn, and assessing 
      the contribution of each remaining design to the inconsistency. The net heat plot 
      takes the form of a matrix which is displayed graphically with coloring indicating 
      the degree of inconsistency in the network. Applied to a network of individual 
      participant data assessing overall survival in 7531 patients with lung cancer, we 
      were surprised to find no evidence of important inconsistency from the net heat 
      approach; this contradicted other approaches for assessing inconsistency such as the 
      Bucher approach, Cochran's Q statistic, node-splitting, and the inconsistency 
      parameter approach, which all suggested evidence of inconsistency within the network 
      at the 5% level. Further theoretical work shows that the calculations underlying the 
      net heat plot constitute an arbitrary weighting of the direct and indirect evidence 
      which may be misleading. We illustrate this further using a simulation study and a 
      network meta-analysis of 10 treatments for diabetes. We conclude that the net heat 
      plot does not reliably signal inconsistency or identify designs that cause 
      inconsistency.

      therefore likely a physiological role in fighting infections. Nevertheless, whether 
      fever in itself is beneficial or harmful in adults is unknown. This protocol for a 
      systematic review aims at identifying the beneficial and harmful effects of fever 
      control interventions in adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol for a 
      systematic review was conducted following the recommendations of Cochrane, GRADE and 
      the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen and colleagues for better validation 
      of meta-analytical results in systematic reviews. We plan to include all relevant 
      randomised clinical trials comparing any fever control intervention with placebo, 
      sham or no intervention in adults. We plan to search CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 
      LILACS, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection to identify 
      relevant trials. Any eligible trial will be assessed and classified as either at 
      high risk of bias or low risk of bias, and our primary conclusions will be based on 
      trials at low risk of bias. We will perform our meta-analyses of the extracted data 
      using Review Manager 5.3 and Trial Sequential Analysis. For all our outcomes, we 
      will create a 'Summary of Findings' table based on GRADE assessments of the 
      certainty of the evidence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No formal approval or review of 
      ethics is required for this systematic review as individual patient data will not be 
      included. This systematic review has the potential to highlight (1) whether one 
      should believe fever to be beneficial, harmful or neither in adults; (2) the 
      existing knowledge gaps on this topic; and (3) whether the recommendations from 
      guidelines and daily clinical practice are correct. These results will be 
      disseminated through publication in a leading peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO

TI  - A Poisson approach to the validation of failure time surrogate endpoints in 
      individual patient data meta-analyses.
PG  - 170-183
LID - 10.1177/0962280217718582 [doi]
AB  - Surrogate endpoints are often used in clinical trials instead of well-established 
      hard endpoints for practical convenience. The meta-analytic approach relies on two 
      measures of surrogacy: one at the individual level and one at the trial level. In 
      the survival data setting, a two-step model based on copulas is commonly used. We 
      present a new approach which employs a bivariate survival model with an individual 
      random effect shared between the two endpoints and correlated treatment-by-trial 
      interactions. We fit this model using auxiliary mixed Poisson models. We study via 
      simulations the operating characteristics of this mixed Poisson approach as compared 
      to the two-step copula approach. We illustrate the application of the methods on two 
      individual patient data meta-analyses in gastric cancer, in the advanced setting 
      (4069 patients from 20 randomized trials) and in the adjuvant setting (3288 patients 
      from 14 randomized trials).

TI  - Effects of alteplase for acute stroke according to criteria defining the European 
      Union and United States marketing authorizations: Individual-patient-data 
      meta-analysis of randomized trials.
PG  - 175-189
LID - 10.1177/1747493017744464 [doi]
AB  - Background The recommended maximum age and time window for intravenous alteplase 
      treatment of acute ischemic stroke differs between the Europe Union and United 
      States. Aims We compared the effects of alteplase in cohorts defined by the current 
      Europe Union or United States marketing approval labels, and by hypothetical 
      revisions of the labels that would remove the Europe Union upper age limit or extend 
      the United States treatment time window to 4.5 h. Methods We assessed outcomes in an 
      individual-patient-data meta-analysis of eight randomized trials of intravenous 
      alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) versus control for acute ischemic stroke. Outcomes included: 
      excellent outcome (modified Rankin score 0-1) at 3-6 months, the distribution of 
      modified Rankin score, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality. 
      Results Alteplase increased the odds of modified Rankin score 0-1 among 2449/6136 
      (40%) patients who met the current European Union label and 3491 (57%) patients who 
      met the age-revised label (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.21-1.68 and 1.43, 1.23-1.65, 
      respectively), but not in those outside the age-revised label (1.06, 0.90-1.26). By 
      90 days, there was no increased mortality in the current and age-revised cohorts 
      (hazard ratios 0.98, 95% CI 0.76-1.25 and 1.01, 0.86-1.19, respectively) but 
      mortality remained higher outside the age-revised label (1.19, 0.99-1.42). 
      Similarly, alteplase increased the odds of modified Rankin score 0-1 among 1174/6136 
      (19%) patients who met the current US approval and 3326 (54%) who met a 4.5-h 
      revised approval (odds ratio 1.55, 1.19-2.01 and 1.37, 1.17-1.59, respectively), but 
      not for those outside the 4.5-h revised approval (1.14, 0.97-1.34). By 90 days, no 
      increased mortality remained for the current and 4.5-h revised label cohorts (hazard 
      ratios 0.99, 0.77-1.26 and 1.02, 0.87-1.20, respectively) but mortality remained 
      higher outside the 4.5-h revised approval (1.17, 0.98-1.41). Conclusions An 
      age-revised European Union label or 4.5-h-revised United States label would each 
      increase the number of patients deriving net benefit from alteplase by 90 days after 
      acute ischemic stroke, without excess mortality.

TI  - Quality of life as a prognostic indicator of survival: A pooled analysis of 
      individual patient data from canadian cancer trials group clinical trials.
PG  - 3409-3416
LID - 10.1002/cncr.31556 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to externally validate an established 
      association between baseline health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores and 
      survival and to assess the added prognostic value of HRQOL with respect to 
      demographic and clinical indicators. METHODS: Pooled data were analyzed from 17 
      randomized controlled trials opened by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group between 1991 
      and 2004; they included survival and baseline HRQOL data from 3606 patients with 8 
      different cancer sites. The models included sex, age (≤60 vs >60 years), World 
      Health Organization performance status (0 or 1 vs 2-4), distant metastases (no vs 
      yes), and 15 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core 
      Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) scales. Analyses were conducted with 
      multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and were stratified by cancer site. 
      Harrell's discrimination C-index was used to calculate the predictive accuracy of 
      the model when HRQOL parameters were added to clinical and demographic variables. 
      The added value of adding HRQOL scales to clinical and demographic variables was 
      illustrated with Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: In the stratified, multivariate 
      model, HRQOL parameters-global health status (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.00; P < . 0001), dyspnea (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 
      1.02-1.06; P < . 0002), and appetite loss (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04-1.08; P < . 
      0001)-were independent prognostic factors in addition to the demographic and 
      clinical variables (all P values < .05). Adding these HRQOL variables to the 
      clinical variables resulted in an added relative prognostic value for survival of 
      5%. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm previous findings showing that baseline HRQOL 
      scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 provide prognostic information in addition to 
      information from clinical measures. However, the impact of specific domains may 
      differ across studies. Cancer 2018. © 2018 American Cancer Society.

TI  - New Evidence Should Inform WHO Guidelines on Multiple Micronutrient Supplementation 
      in Pregnancy.
PG  - 359-361
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxy279 [doi]
AB  - Recent data from an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of 17 randomized 
      control trials including >100,000 women living in low- and middle-income countries 
      found that multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) in pregnancy reduced the 
      risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, and being born small for gestational age. 
      Further, MMS reduced the risk of neonatal and infant mortality for females, and 
      there was no evidence of increased risk among the 26 subgroups examined. The 2016 
      WHO antenatal care guidelines, which were released before the IPD meta-analysis, did 
      not universally recommend MMS, noting: "There is some evidence of additional benefit 
      … but there is also some evidence of risk." The guidelines suggest that MMS may 
      increase the risk of neonatal mortality based on an exploratory subgroup analysis of 
      6 randomized trials. However, we identified several issues with this subgroup 
      analysis. In this report we correct and update the subgroup analysis and show that 
      there is no evidence that MMS increases the risk of neonatal mortality. There is 
      growing scientific consensus that MMS containing iron and folic acid (IFA) is 
      superior to IFA alone. The WHO guidelines currently state that "policy-makers in 
      populations with a high prevalence of nutritional deficiencies might consider the 
      benefits of MMN [multiple micronutrient] supplements on maternal health to outweigh 
      the disadvantages, and may choose to give MMN supplements that include iron and 
      folic acid." This equivocal guidance has created confusion about the best course of 
      action for public health programs in low- and middle-income countries. Given the new 
      evidence, WHO should review their statements regarding the potential neonatal 
      mortality risks and re-evaluate the overall potential benefits of implementing MMS 
      as a public health program.

TI  - Initial severity of depression and efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy: 
      individual-participant data meta-analysis of pill-placebo-controlled trials.
PG  - 190-196
LID - 10.1192/bjp.bp.116.187773 [doi]
AB  - BackgroundThe influence of baseline severity has been examined for antidepressant 
      medications but has not been studied properly for cognitive-behavioural therapy 
      (CBT) in comparison with pill placebo.AimsTo synthesise evidence regarding the 
      influence of initial severity on efficacy of CBT from all randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) in which CBT, in face-to-face individual or group format, was compared 
      with pill-placebo control in adults with major depression.MethodA systematic review 
      and an individual-participant data meta-analysis using mixed models that included 
      trial effects as random effects. We used multiple imputation to handle missing 
      data.ResultsWe identified five RCTs, and we were given access to individual-level 
      data (n = 509) for all five. The analyses revealed that the difference in changes in 
      Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression between CBT and pill placebo was not influenced 
      by baseline severity (interaction P = 0.43). Removing the non-significant 
      interaction term from the model, the difference between CBT and pill placebo was a 
      standardised mean difference of -0.22 (95% CI -0.42 to -0.02, P = 0.03, I(2) = 
      0%).ConclusionsPatients suffering from major depression can expect as much benefit 
      from CBT across the wide range of baseline severity. This finding can help inform 
      individualised treatment decisions by patients and their clinicians.

TI  - Effectiveness of nutritional interventions in older adults at risk of malnutrition 
      across different health care settings: Pooled analyses of individual participant 
      data from nine randomized controlled trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Protein-energy malnutrition is a health concern among older 
      adults. Improving nutritional status by increasing energy and protein intake likely 
      benefits health. We therefore aimed to investigate effects of nutritional 
      interventions in older adults (at risk of malnutrition) on change in energy intake 
      and body weight, and explore if the intervention effect was modified by study or 
      participants' characteristics, analysing pooled individual participant data. 
      METHODS: We searched for RCTs investigating the effect of dietary counseling, oral 
      nutritional supplements (ONS) or both on energy intake and weight. Principle 
      investigators of eligible studies provided individual participant data. We 
      investigated the effect of nutritional intervention on meaningful increase in energy 
      intake (>250 kcal/day) and meaningful weight gain (>1.0 kg). Logistic generalized 
      estimating equations were performed and ORs with 95% CIs presented. RESULTS: We 
      included data of nine studies with a total of 990 participants, aged 79.2 ± 8.2 
      years, 64.5% women and mean baseline BMI 23.9 ± 4.7 kg/m(2). An non-significant 
      intervention effect was observed for increase in energy intake (OR:1.59; 95% CI 
      0.95, 2.66) and a significant intervention effect for weight gain (OR:1.58; 95% CI 
      1.16, 2.17). Stratifying by type of intervention, an intervention effect on increase 
      in energy intake was only observed for dietary counseling in combination with ONS 
      (OR:2.28; 95% CI 1.90, 2.73). The intervention effect on increase in energy intake 
      was greater for women, older participants, and those with lower BMI. Regarding 
      weight gain, an intervention effect was observed for dietary counseling (OR:1.40; 
      95% CI 1.14, 1.73) and dietary counseling in combination with ONS (OR:2.48; 95% CI 
      1.92, 3.31). The intervention effect on weight gain was not influenced by 
      participants' characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Based on pooled data of older adults (at 
      risk of malnutrition), nutritional interventions have a positive effect on energy 
      intake and body weight. Dietary counseling combined with ONS is the most effective 
      intervention.

TI  - A novel approach for identifying and addressing case-mix heterogeneity in individual 
      participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - 582-596
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1382 [doi]
AB  - Case-mix heterogeneity across studies complicates meta-analyses. As a result of 
      this, treatments that are equally effective on patient subgroups may appear to have 
      different effectiveness on patient populations with different case mix. It is 
      therefore important that meta-analyses be explicit for what patient population they 
      describe the treatment effect. To achieve this, we develop a new approach for 
      meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, which use individual patient data (IPD) 
      from all trials to infer the treatment effect for the patient population in a given 
      trial, based on direct standardization using either outcome regression (OCR) or 
      inverse probability weighting (IPW). Accompanying random-effect meta-analysis models 
      are developed. The new approach enables disentangling heterogeneity due to case mix 
      from that due to beyond case-mix reasons.

      Trial Sequential Analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clazosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, reduced vasospasm and 
      delayed ischemic neurologic deficit (DIND) but did not improve outcome after 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in clinical trials. However, a lack of dose-dependent 
      analysis and potential overestimation of clazosentan's effect are concerning. We 
      used stratified analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA) of existing data to 
      investigate the effects of clazosentan on SAH outcome. METHODS: Studies from PubMed, 
      Embase, and Cochrane were reviewed for eligibility. Primary outcomes were DIND 
      requiring rescue therapy, all-cause mortality, and vasospasm-related morbidity at 6 
      weeks. Secondary outcomes were moderate-to-severe angiographic vasospasm, new 
      cerebral infarction, and poor clinical outcome at 3 months. TSA was performed to 
      assess the required information size and the α-spending monitoring boundary effect 
      of relative risk (RR) reduction. A stratified analysis of clazosentan dosage was 
      performed. RESULTS: Five studies (N = 2317) were included. Clazosentan significantly 
      reduced the risk of DIND requiring rescue therapy (RR, 0.625; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.462-0.846) and vasospasm (RR, 0.543; 95% CI, 0.464-0.635), but did 
      not significantly affect mortality or vasospasm-related morbidity (RR, 0.775; 95% 
      CI, 0.578-1.039), new cerebral infarction (RR, 0.604; 95% CI, 0.383-0.952), or 
      outcome (RR, 1.131; 95% CI, 0.959-1.334). TSA revealed that the studies were 
      underpowered to evaluate the effects of clazosentan on mortality and 
      vasospasm-associated morbidity. We found 10-15 mg/h of clazosentan administration 
      was associated with lower rates of vasospasm and new cerebral infarctions compared 
      with 5 mg/h. CONCLUSIONS: Clazosentan reduced the risk of DIND requiring rescue 
      therapy and moderate-to-severe vasospasm. Further meta-analyses based on individual 
      patient data with different clazosentan doses and more refined outcome measures are 
      necessary to clarify clazosentan's efficacy in improving post-SAH outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain 
      stimulation modality that has been increasingly used for major depressive disorder 
      (MDD) treatment. Although studies in healthy volunteers showed that the technique is 
      well-tolerated, tDCS safety and acceptability have not been sufficiently explored in 
      patients with MDD. METHODS: We collected individual patient data from 6 randomized 
      clinical trials that had been previously identified in a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were safety (rate of adverse events) and 
      acceptability (rate of dropouts). Secondary outcomes were clinical, demographic and 
      treatment predictors of the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Dropout rates between active 
      (8.8%) and sham (12%) groups were not significantly different (OR= 0.7, p=0.38). 
      Adverse event rates between active (73.5%) and sham (68.3%) groups were not 
      significantly different (OR= 1.4, p= 0.23). Higher current densities were associated 
      with lower adverse event rates. LIMITATIONS: Dropout reasons were not systematically 
      reported and adverse events were not collected using questionnaires standardized 
      across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Active tDCS is as acceptable and safe as sham tDCS, as 
      found in randomized clinical trials of MDD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This systematic review protocol describes the methods that will be 
      used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of herbal medicine Sihogayonggolmoryeo-tang 
      (SGYMT) or Chai-Hu-Jia-Long-Gu-Mu-Li-Tang for the treatment of post-stroke 
      depression. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following electronic databases will be 
      searched up to July 2018 without language or publication status restrictions: 
      MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, 
      Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cumulative Index to Nursing, and 
      Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and PsycARTICLES. We will also search Korean and 
      Chinese databases. Any clinical randomized controlled trials related to SGYMT 
      treatment for post-stroke depression will be included. Changes in the degree of 
      depression and adverse events will be assessed as primary outcomes. The total 
      effective rate and changes in neurological function, activities of daily living, and 
      quality of life will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. Study selection, data 
      extraction, assessment of study quality, and evaluation of the quality of evidence 
      for the main findings will be performed independently by 2 researchers. The data 
      synthesis and analysis will be performed using RevMan version 5.3. The results will 
      be expressed as a risk ratio for dichotomous data and as the mean difference or 
      standardized mean difference for continuous data. Data will be synthesized by either 
      a fixed-effects or random-effects model according to a heterogeneity test or the 
      number of studies included in the meta-analysis. The methodological quality of the 
      included studies will be evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias 
      tool. The quality of evidence for each main outcome will be evaluated using the 
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required because individual 
      patient data are not included. The findings of this systematic review will be 
      disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication or conference presentations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of individual patient data meta-analyses published is very 
      low especially in surgical domains. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of 
      individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses in orthopaedic surgery by determining 
      whether trialists agree to send IPD for eligible trials. METHODS: We performed a 
      literature search to identify relevant research questions in orthopaedic surgery. 
      For each question, we developed a protocol synopsis for an IPD meta-analysis and 
      identified all related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with results published 
      since 2000. Corresponding authors of these RCTs were sent personalized emails that 
      presented a project for an IPD meta-analysis corresponding to one of the research 
      questions, with a link to the protocol synopsis, and asking for IPD from their RCT. 
      We guaranteed patient confidentiality and secure data storage, and offered 
      co-authorship and coverage of costs related to extraction. RESULTS: We identified 38 
      research questions and 273 RCTs related to these questions. We could contact 217 of 
      the 273 corresponding authors (79 %; 56 had unavailable or non-functional email 
      addresses) and received 68/273 responses (25 %): 21 authors refused to share IPD, 10 
      stated that our request was under consideration and 37 agreed to send IPD. Four 
      corresponding authors required authorship and three others asked for financial 
      support to send the IPD. Overall, we could obtain IPD for 5,110 of 33,602 eligible 
      patients (15 %). Among the 38 research questions, only one IPD meta-analysis could 
      be potentially initiated because we could receive IPD for more than 50 % of 
      participants. CONCLUSION: The present study illustrates the difficulties in 
      initiating IPD meta-analyses in orthopaedic surgery. Significant efforts must be 
      made to improve data sharing.

      Application.

LID - 247
AB  - Despite improvements in perinatal care, preterm birth still occurs regularly and the 
      associated brain injury and adverse neurological outcomes remain a persistent 
      challenge. Antenatal magnesium sulfate administration is an intervention with 
      demonstrated neuroprotective effects for preterm births before 32 weeks of gestation 
      (WG). Owing to its biological properties, including its action as an 
      N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blocker and its anti-inflammatory effects, magnesium 
      is a good candidate for neuroprotection. In hypoxia models, including 
      hypoxia-ischemia, inflammation, and excitotoxicity in various species (mice, rats, 
      pigs), magnesium sulfate preconditioning decreased the induced lesions' sizes and 
      inflammatory cytokine levels, prevented cell death, and improved long-term behavior. 
      In humans, some observational studies have demonstrated reduced risks of cerebral 
      palsy after antenatal magnesium sulfate therapy. Meta-analyses of five randomized 
      controlled trials using magnesium sulfate as a neuroprotectant showed amelioration 
      of cerebral palsy at 2 years. A meta-analysis of individual participant data from 
      these trials showed an equally strong decrease in cerebral palsy and the combined 
      risk of fetal/infant death and cerebral palsy at 2 years. The benefit remained 
      similar regardless of gestational age, cause of prematurity, and total dose 
      received. These data support the use of a minimal dose (e.g., 4 g loading 
      dose ± 1 g/h maintenance dose over 12 h) to avoid potential deleterious effects. 
      Antenatal magnesium sulfate is now recommended by the World Health Organization and 
      many pediatric and obstetrical societies, and it is requisite to maximize its 
      administration among women at risk of preterm delivery before 32 WG.

AB  - Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may enhance recovery from stroke 
      through neuroprotective mechanisms if administered early, or neurorepair if given 
      later. Several small trials suggest administration is safe but effects on efficacy 
      are unclear. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCT) assessing G-CSF in 
      patients with hyperacute, acute, subacute or chronic stroke, and asked Investigators 
      to share individual patient data on baseline characteristics, stroke severity and 
      type, end-of-trial modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel Index, haematological 
      parameters, serious adverse events and death. Multiple variable analyses were 
      adjusted for age, sex, baseline severity and time-to-treatment. Individual patient 
      data were obtained for 6 of 10 RCTs comprising 196 stroke patients (116 G-CSF, 80 
      placebo), mean age 67.1 (SD 12.9), 92% ischaemic, median NIHSS 10 (IQR 5-15), 
      randomised 11 days (interquartile range IQR 4-238) post ictus; data from three 
      commercial trials were not shared. G-CSF did not improve mRS (ordinal regression), 
      odds ratio OR 1.12 (95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.96, p = 0.62). There were more 
      patients with a serious adverse event in the G-CSF group (29.6% versus 7.5%, 
      p = 0.07) with no significant difference in all-cause mortality (G-CSF 11.2%, 
      placebo 7.6%, p = 0.4). Overall, G-CSF did not improve stroke outcome in this 
      individual patient data meta-analysis.

TI  - Introducing the 'Drucebo' effect in statin therapy: a systematic review of studies 
      comparing reported rates of statin-associated muscle symptoms, under blinded and 
      open-label conditions.
PG  - 1023-1033
LID - 10.1002/jcsm.12344 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 'placebo effect' and 'nocebo effect' are phenomena whereby 
      beneficial (placebo) or adverse (nocebo) effects result from the expectation that an 
      inert substance will relieve or cause a particular symptom. These terms are often 
      inappropriately applied to effects experienced on drug therapy. Quantifying the 
      magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects in clinical trials is problematic because it 
      requires a 'no treatment' arm. To overcome the difficulties associated with 
      measuring the nocebo effect, and the fact that its definition refers to inert 
      compounds, rather than drugs, we introduce the concept of 'drucebo' (a combination 
      of DRUg and plaCEBO or noCEBO) to relate to beneficial or adverse effects of a drug, 
      which result from expectation and are not pharmacologically caused by the drug. As 
      an initial application of the concept, we have estimated the contribution of the 
      drucebo effect to statin discontinuation and statin-induced muscle symptoms by 
      performing a systematic review of randomized controlled trial of statin therapy. 
      METHODS: This preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and 
      meta-analysis-compliant systematic review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO 
      (CRD42017082700). We searched PubMed and Cochrane Central from inception until 3 
      January 2018 using a search strategy designed to detect studies including the 
      concepts (Statins AND Placebo AND muscle pain). We included studies that allowed us 
      to quantify the drucebo effect for adverse muscle symptoms of statins by (i) 
      comparing reported rates of muscle symptoms in blinded and unblinded phases of 
      randomized controlled trials and (ii) comparing rates of muscle symptoms at baseline 
      and during blinded therapy in trials that included patients with objectively 
      confirmed statin intolerance at baseline. Extraction was performed by two 
      researchers with disagreements settled by a third reviewer. RESULTS: Five studies 
      allowed the estimation of the drucebo effect. All trials demonstrated an excess of 
      side effects under open-label conditions. The contribution of the drucebo effect to 
      statin-associated muscle pain ranged between 38% and 78%. The heterogeneity of study 
      methods, outcomes, and reporting did not allow for quantitative synthesis 
      (meta-analysis) of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The drucebo effect may be useful in 
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of medicines. Diagnosis of the drucebo effect in 
      patients presenting with statin intolerance will allow restoration of 
      life-prolonging lipid-lowering therapy. Our study was limited by heterogeneity of 
      included studies and lack of access to individual patient data. Further studies are 
      necessary to better understand risk factors for and clinical management of the 
      drucebo effect.

TI  - Treating depression with botulinum toxin: a pooled analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Botulinum toxin A (BTA) injection into the glabellar region is 
      currently being studied as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Here we 
      explore efficacy data of this novel approach in a pooled analysis. METHODS: A 
      literature search revealed 3 RCTs on this topic. Individual patient data and 
      clinical end points shared by these 3 trials were pooled and analyzed as one study 
      (n=134) using multiple regression models with random effects. RESULTS: In the pooled 
      sample, the BTA (n=59) and the placebo group (n=75) did not differ in the baseline 
      variables. Efficacy outcomes revealed BTA superiority over placebo: Improvement in 
      the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale 6 
      weeks after baseline was 45.7% for BTA vs. 14.6% for placebo (p<0.0001), 
      corresponding to a BTA response rate of 54.2% (vs. 10.7%) and a BTA remission rate 
      of 30.5% (vs. 6.7%). DISCUSSION: Equalling the status of a meta-analysis, this study 
      increases evidence that a single treatment of BTA into the glabellar region can 
      reduce symptoms of MDD. Further studies are needed to better understand how BTA 
      exerts its mood-lifting effect.

TI  - Interventions for preventing high altitude illness: Part 1. Commonly-used classes of 
      drugs.
PG  - CD009761
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009761.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD009761
AB  - BACKGROUND: High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of 
      cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 
      2500 metres (8202 feet). Acute hypoxia, acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude 
      cerebral oedema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as 
      potential medical problems associated with high altitude. In this review, the first 
      in a series of three about preventive strategies for HAI, we assess the 
      effectiveness of six of the most recommended classes of pharmacological 
      interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events 
      of commonly-used pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI. SEARCH 
      METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 
      MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), LILACS and trial registries in January 2017. We 
      adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a 
      combination of thesaurus-based and free-text terms to search. SELECTION CRITERIA: We 
      included randomized-controlled and cross-over trials conducted in any setting where 
      commonly-used classes of drugs were used to prevent acute HAI. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. MAIN 
      RESULTS: We included 64 studies (78 references) and 4547 participants in this 
      review, and classified 12 additional studies as ongoing. A further 12 studies await 
      classification, as we were unable to obtain the full texts. Most of the studies were 
      conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure 
      (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. Twenty-four trials provided the 
      intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between 
      one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude 
      of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. Risks of bias were unclear for 
      several domains, and a considerable number of studies did not report adverse events 
      of the evaluated interventions. We found 26 comparisons, 15 of them comparing 
      commonly-used drugs versus placebo. We report results for the three most important 
      comparisons: Acetazolamide versus placebo (28 parallel studies; 2345 
      participants)The risk of AMS was reduced with acetazolamide (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 
      95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.56; I(2) = 0%; 16 studies; 2301 participants; 
      moderate quality of evidence). No events of HAPE were reported and only one event of 
      HACE (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.48; 6 parallel studies; 1126 participants; moderate 
      quality of evidence). Few studies reported side effects for this comparison, and 
      they showed an increase in the risk of paraesthesia with the intake of acetazolamide 
      (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.81 to 10.88, I(2) = 60%; 5 studies, 789 participants; low quality 
      of evidence). Budenoside versus placebo (2 parallel studies; 132 participants)Data 
      on budenoside showed a reduction in the incidence of AMS compared with placebo (RR 
      0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61; I(2) = 0%; 2 studies, 132 participants; low quality of 
      evidence). Studies included did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and they did not 
      find side effects (low quality of evidence). Dexamethasone versus placebo (7 
      parallel studies; 205 participants)For dexamethasone, the data did not show benefits 
      at any dosage (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.00; I2 = 39%; 4 trials, 176 participants; 
      low quality of evidence). Included studies did not report events of HAPE or HACE, 
      and we rated the evidence about adverse events as of very low quality. AUTHORS' 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our assessment of the most commonly-used pharmacological interventions 
      suggests that acetazolamide is an effective pharmacological agent to prevent acute 
      HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day. This information is based on evidence of 
      moderate quality. Acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of 
      paraesthesia, although there are few reports about other adverse events from the 
      available evidence. The clinical benefits and harms of other pharmacological 
      interventions such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear. Large 
      multicentre studies are needed for most of the pharmacological agents evaluated in 
      this review, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.

TI  - Early Magnesium Treatment After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: Individual 
      Patient Data Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 3190-3
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.010575 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is an important cause of 
      poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Trials of magnesium 
      treatment starting <4 days after symptom onset found no effect on poor outcome or 
      DCI in SAH. Earlier installment of treatment might be more effective, but individual 
      trials had not enough power for such a subanalysis. We performed an individual 
      patient data meta-analysis to study whether magnesium is effective when given within 
      different time frames within 24 hours after the SAH. METHODS: Patients were divided 
      into categories according to the delay between symptom onset and start of the study 
      medication: <6, 6 to 12, 12 to 24, and >24 hours. We calculated adjusted risk ratios 
      with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for magnesium versus placebo treatment 
      for poor outcome and DCI. RESULTS: We included 5 trials totaling 1981 patients; 83 
      patients started treatment<6 hours. For poor outcome, the adjusted risk ratios of 
      magnesium treatment for start <6 hours were 1.44 (95% confidence interval, 
      0.83-2.51); for 6 to 12 hours 1.03 (0.65-1.63), for 12 to 24 hours 0.84 (0.65-1.09), 
      and for >24 hours 1.06 (0.87-1.31), and for DCI, <6 hours 1.76 (0.68-4.58), for 6 to 
      12 hours 2.09 (0.99-4.39), for 12 to 24 hours 0.80 (0.56-1.16), and for >24 hours 
      1.08 (0.88-1.32). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests no beneficial effect of 
      magnesium treatment on poor outcome or DCI when started early after SAH onset. 
      Although the number of patients was small and a beneficial effect cannot be 
      definitively excluded, we found no justification for a new trial with early 
      magnesium treatment after SAH.

TI  - Cerebrolysin in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis of randomized 
      controlled clinical trials.
PG  - 332-47
LID - 10.1159/000377672 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide a systematic and quantitative 
      summary of benefit and risk of Cerebrolysin in patients with mild-to-moderate 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to avoid major deficiencies of an earlier 
      meta-analysis. DESIGN: This is a meta-analysis of randomized double-blind 
      placebo-controlled clinical trials. DATA SOURCES: Trials were identified with the 
      help of PubMed, the Cochrane Dementia Group database, the Center for Collaborative 
      Neurosciences, and references from reviews; no language restrictions were applied. 
      STUDY SELECTION: All randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies on 30 ml/day 
      of Cerebrolysin in mild-to-moderate AD were included. RESULTS: There were 6 eligible 
      randomized controlled trials comparing Cerebrolysin with placebo. For all studies, 
      either individual patient data and/or published data (aggregate data) were 
      available. Analyses were based on the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomized global 
      clinical change and for safety criteria, on the standardized mean difference (SMD) 
      for pooling of cognitive function, and on the Mann-Whitney statistic (MW) for 
      multivariate analysis of 'global benefit' (combined effect of global clinical change 
      and cognitive function). Cerebrolysin was significantly more effective than placebo 
      at 4 weeks regarding cognitive function (4 weeks: SMD -0.40 points; 95% CI -0.66 to 
      -0.13; p = 0.0031; 6 months: SMD -0.37 points; 95% CI -0.90 to 0.16; p = 0.1710), at 
      4 weeks and 6 months regarding global clinical change (4 weeks: OR 3.32; 95% CI 
      1.20-9.21; p = 0.0212; 6 months: OR 4.98; 95% CI 1.37-18.13; p = 0.0150), and at 4 
      weeks and 6 months regarding 'global benefit' (combined efficacy criteria; 4 weeks: 
      MW 0.57, 95% CI 0.53-0.61; p = 0.0006; 6 months: MW 0.57; 95% CI 0.53-0.61; p = 
      0.0010). The safety aspects of Cerebrolysin were comparable to placebo. CONCLUSION: 
      This meta-analysis provides evidence that Cerebrolysin has an overall beneficial 
      effect and a favorable benefit-risk ratio in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. 
      Cerebrolysin as a therapeutic agent should be considered by clinicians seeking 
      treatment options for mild-to-moderate AD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the IMPACT (IMProving Access to Clinical Trial data) 
      Observatory is to assess the transformation of clinical trials (CT) related to the 
      evolution of sharing of CT data. The objective of this study is to establish a 
      baseline for monitoring CT data sharing by the Observatory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      In this scoping review we searched for publications that address sharing, 
      dissemination, transparency or reuse of CT data published prior to December 31st 
      2000. Two authors screened titles and abstracts of 1204 records received by Medline 
      searches and added 47 publications from direct discovery. Four researchers 
      extracted, coded, and analyzed the predefined information from 102 selected papers. 
      RESULTS: We found a growing recognition of the importance of data sharing prior to 
      2001. However, there were numerous obstacles including the ambiguity of the concept 
      of data sharing, the absence of specific terminology and the lack of an "open" 
      culture. By the end of 2000, data, metadata, and evidence based medicine were 
      defined. Data sharing, registries, databases and re-analyses of individual patient 
      data (IPD) emerged. The use of systematic reviews and IPD meta-analysis in decision 
      making was promoted. Most arguments for broader data sharing came from oncology, 
      paediatrics, rare diseases, AIDS, pregnancy, perinatal medicine, and media reporting 
      related scandals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the year 2000 could be 
      used as a baseline for monitoring the evolution of CT data sharing as basic 
      prerequisites were set in place, including greater understanding that CT data 
      sharing is essential for decision making and the advancements of the Internet.

TI  - Individual patient data meta-analysis of self-monitoring of blood pressure 
      (BP-SMART): a protocol.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Self-monitoring of blood pressure is effective in reducing blood 
      pressure in hypertension. However previous meta-analyses have shown a considerable 
      amount of heterogeneity between studies, only part of which can be accounted for by 
      meta-regression. This may be due to differences in design, recruited populations, 
      intervention components or results among patient subgroups. To further investigate 
      these differences, an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of self-monitoring 
      of blood pressure will be performed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will identify 
      randomised trials that have compared patients with hypertension who are 
      self-monitoring blood pressure with those who are not and invite trialists to 
      provide IPD including clinic and/or ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
      at baseline and all follow-up points where both intervention and control groups were 
      measured. Other data requested will include measurement methodology, length of 
      follow-up, cointerventions, baseline demographic (age, gender) and psychosocial 
      factors (deprivation, quality of life), setting, intensity of self-monitoring, 
      self-monitored blood pressure, comorbidities, lifestyle factors (weight, smoking) 
      and presence or not of antihypertensive treatment. Data on all available patients 
      will be included in order to take an intention-to-treat approach. A two-stage 
      procedure for IPD meta-analysis, stratified by trial and taking into account age, 
      sex, diabetes and baseline systolic BP will be used. Exploratory subgroup analyses 
      will further investigate non-linear relationships between the prespecified 
      variables. Sensitivity analyses will assess the impact of trials which have and have 
      not provided IPD. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study does not include identifiable 
      data. Results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed publication and by 
      international conference presentations. CONCLUSIONS: IPD analysis should help the 
      understanding of which self-monitoring interventions for which patient groups are 
      most effective in the control of blood pressure.

TI  - Development and validation of a prediction model for the probability of responding 
      to placebo in antidepressant trials: a pooled analysis of individual patient data.
PG  - 10-16

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying potential placebo responders among apparent drug responders 
      is critical to dissect drug-specific and nonspecific effects in depression. 
      OBJECTIVE: This project aimed to develop and test a prediction model for the 
      probability of responding to placebo in antidepressant trials. Such a model will 
      allow us to estimate the probability of placebo response among drug responders in 
      antidepressants trials. METHODS: We identified all placebo-controlled, double-blind 
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of second generation antidepressants for major 
      depressive disorder conducted in Japan and requested their individual patient data 
      (IPD) to pharmaceutical companies. We obtained IPD (n=1493) from four phase II/III 
      RCTs comparing mirtazapine, escitalopram, duloxetine, paroxetine and placebo. Out of 
      1493 participants in the four clinical trials, 440 participants allocated to placebo 
      were included in the analyses. Our primary outcome was response, defined as 50% or 
      greater reduction on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression at study endpoint. We used 
      multivariable logistic regression to develop a prediction model. All available 
      candidate of predictor variables were tested through a backward variable selection 
      and covariates were selected for the prediction model. The performance of the model 
      was assessed by using Hosmer-Lemeshow test for calibration and the area under the 
      ROC curve for discrimination. FINDINGS: Placebo response rates differed between 31% 
      and 59% (grand average: 43%) among four trials. Four variables were selected from 
      all candidate variables and included in the final model: age at onset, age at 
      baseline, bodily symptoms, and study-level difference. The final model performed 
      satisfactorily in terms of calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=0.92) and discrimination 
      (the area under the ROC curve (AUC): 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Our model is expected to 
      help researchers discriminate individuals who are more likely to respond to placebo 
      from those who are less likely so. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: A larger sample and more 
      precise individual participant information should be collected for better 
      performance. Examination of external validity in independent datasets is warranted.

TI  - Influence of stent design and use of protection devices on outcome of carotid artery 
      stenting: a pooled analysis of individual patient data.
PG  - 1149-1154
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013622 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid artery stenting is an alternative to endarterectomy 
      for the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis but was associated with a higher 
      risk of procedural stroke or death in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Technical 
      aspects of treatment may partly explain these results. The purpose of this analysis 
      was to investigate the influence of technical aspects such as stent design or the 
      use of protection devices, as well as clinical variables, on procedural risk. 
      METHODS: We pooled data of 1557 individual patients receiving stent treatment in 
      three large RCTs comparing stenting versus endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid 
      stenosis. The primary outcome event was any procedural stroke or death occurring 
      within 30 days after stenting. RESULTS: Procedural stroke or death occurred 
      significantly more often with the use of open-cell stents (61/595 patients, 10.3%) 
      than with closed-cell stents (58/962 patients, 6.0%; RR 1.76; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.52; 
      P=0.002). Procedural stroke or death occurred in 76/950 patients (8.0%) treated with 
      protection devices (predominantly distal filters) and in 43/607 (7.1%) treated 
      without protection devices (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.70; P=0.67). Clinical 
      variables predicting the primary outcome event were age, severity of the qualifying 
      event, history of prior stroke, and level of disability at baseline. The effect of 
      stent design remained similar after adjustment for these variables. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      symptomatic carotid stenosis, the use of stents with a closed-cell design is 
      independently associated with a lower risk of procedural stroke or death compared 
      with open-cell stents. Filter-type protection devices do not appear to reduce 
      procedural risk.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis: the effects of fermented milk with 
      Bifidobacterium lactis CNCM I-2494 and lactic acid bacteria on gastrointestinal 
      discomfort in the general adult population.
PG  - 74-88

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that probiotics may improve gastrointestinal 
      discomfort. Not all probiotics exhibit the same effects and consequently 
      meta-analyses on probiotics should be confined to well-defined strains or strain 
      combinations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a probiotic 
      fermented milk (PFM) that includes Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis) CNCM I-2494 
      and lactic acid bacteria on gastrointestinal discomfort in the general adult 
      population. METHODS: Double-blind randomized controlled trials in the general adult 
      population comparing PFM with a control dairy product for at least 4 weeks were 
      searched from multiple literature databases (up to February 2015). Meta-analyses 
      using random-effects models, with individual participant data were undertaken to 
      calculate an odds ratio (OR) or standard mean difference (SMD), with a 95% 
      confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The search strategy identified 12,439 documents. 
      Overall, three trials with a total of 598 adults (female = 96.5%) met the inclusion 
      criteria. Consumption of the PFM product was associated with a significant 
      improvement in overall gastrointestinal discomfort compared with the control product 
      (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.07-2.05), with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10.24 (95% CI 
      5.64-55.93). PFM was also superior to the control in reducing digestive symptoms, as 
      measured using a composite score (SMD = -0.21; 95% CI -0.37 to -0.05). Sensitivity 
      analyses produced similar results, and the heterogeneity between studies was 
      minimal. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that the consumption of PFM with B. 
      lactis CNCM I-2494 and lactic acid bacteria is associated with a modest but 
      consistent and significant improvement of outcomes related to gastrointestinal 
      discomfort in healthy adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the nature and incidence of psychiatric and cognitive adverse 
      events (AEs) reported with eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) used as adjunctive 
      treatment for refractory partial-onset seizures (POS) in adults. METHODS: This was a 
      post-hoc analysis of data pooled from three randomized double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trials (BIA-2093-301, -302, -304). After an 8-week baseline 
      period, patients received placebo or adjunctive ESL 400mg (studies 301 and 302 
      only), 800mg, or 1200mg once daily (QD) for 14weeks (2-week titration period, 
      12-week maintenance period). Psychiatric and cognitive AEs were identified from 
      individual patient data. Suicidality was also evaluated using the 
      Columbia-Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA), or the 
      Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). P-values were obtained using the 
      chi-square test of independence or Fisher's exact test, without correcting for 
      multiplicity. RESULTS: The analysis population included 1447 patients (ESL, n=1021; 
      placebo, n = 426). Psychiatric treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurred in 10.8% of 
      patients receiving ESL, and in a comparable proportion (10.3%) of patients receiving 
      placebo (p=0.802). The incidence of depression and suicidality-related TEAEs was 
      higher for ESL (7.4%) vs. placebo (3.8%) (p=0.009). The occurrence of these TEAEs 
      differed between treatment groups (p = 0.010), but there was no notable trend 
      between increasing ESL dose and increasing incidence of depression and 
      suicidality-related TEAEs. Aggression/hostility-related TEAEs occurred in <0.1% of 
      patients taking ESL vs. 0.9% taking placebo. The incidence of cognitive TEAEs was 
      higher for ESL (7.1%) vs. placebo (4.0%) (p=0.023); incidences of memory impairment, 
      attention disturbance, apathy, and aphasia were higher for ESL 1200mg than for other 
      treatment groups. Incidences of psychiatric and cognitive serious AEs (SAEs) were 
      0.6% and 0.2% with ESL, and 0.5% and 0% with placebo, respectively. Psychiatric and 
      cognitive TEAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 1.9% and 1.4% of patients 
      taking ESL, and 0.7% and 0.5% taking placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In phase 
      III clinical trials of adjunctive ESL for treatment-refractory POS, psychiatric and 
      cognitive TEAEs were reported infrequently with ESL and placebo. The incidences of 
      depression and suicidality-related TEAEs and of cognitive TEAEs were higher for 
      patients taking ESL vs. placebo. Incidences of psychiatric and cognitive SAEs, and 
      TEAEs leading to discontinuation, were low with ESL and placebo.

AB  - Pulmonary coagulopathy is a characteristic feature of lung injury including 
      ventilator-induced lung injury. The aim of this individual patient data 
      meta-analysis is to assess the effects of nebulized anticoagulants on outcome of 
      ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A systematic search of PubMed 
      (1966-2014), Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant 
      publications. Studies evaluating nebulization of anticoagulants in ventilated 
      patients were screened for inclusion, and corresponding authors of included studies 
      were contacted to provide individual patient data. The primary endpoint was the 
      number of ventilator-free days and alive at day 28. Secondary endpoints included 
      hospital mortality, ICU- and hospital-free days at day 28, and lung injury scores at 
      day seven. We constructed a propensity score-matched cohort for comparisons between 
      patients treated with nebulized anticoagulants and controls. Data from five studies 
      (one randomized controlled trial, one open label study, and three studies using 
      historical controls) were included in the meta-analysis, compassing 286 patients. In 
      all studies unfractionated heparin was used as anticoagulant. The number of 
      ventilator-free days and alive at day 28 was higher in patients treated with 
      nebulized heparin compared to patients in the control group (14 [IQR 0-23] vs. 6 
      [IQR 0-22]), though the difference did not reach statistical significance 
      (P = 0.459). The number of ICU-free days and alive at day 28 was significantly 
      higher, and the lung injury scores at day seven were significantly lower in patients 
      treated with nebulized heparin. In the propensity score-matched analysis, there were 
      no differences in any of the endpoints. This individual patient data meta-analysis 
      provides no convincing evidence for benefit of heparin nebulization in intubated and 
      ventilated ICU patients. The small patient numbers and methodological shortcomings 
      of included studies underline the need for high-quality well-powered randomized 
      controlled trials.

TI  - Utility scores for different health states related to depression: individual 
      participant data analysis.
PG  - 1649-1658
LID - 10.1007/s11136-017-1536-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Depression is associated with considerable impairments in health-related 
      quality-of-life. However, the relationship between different health states related 
      to depression severity and utility scores is unclear. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate whether utility scores are different for various health states related to 
      depression severity. METHODS: We gathered individual participant data from ten 
      randomized controlled trials evaluating depression treatments. The UK EQ-5D and 
      SF-6D tariffs were used to generate utility scores. We defined five health states 
      that were proposed from American Psychiatric Association and National Institute for 
      Clinical Excellence guidelines: remission, minor depression, mild depression, 
      moderate depression, and severe depression. We performed multilevel linear 
      regression analysis. RESULTS: We included 1629 participants in the analyses. The 
      average EQ-5D utility scores for the five health states were 0.70 (95% CI 0.67-0.73) 
      for remission, 0.62 (95% CI 0.58-0.65) for minor depression, 0.57 (95% CI 0.54-0.61) 
      for mild depression, 0.52 (95%CI 0.49-0.56) for moderate depression, and 0.39 (95% 
      CI 0.35-0.43) for severe depression. In comparison with the EQ-5D, the utility 
      scores based on the SF-6D were similar for remission (EQ-5D = 0.70 vs. 
      SF-6D = 0.69), but higher for severe depression (EQ-5D = 0.39 vs. SF-6D = 0.55). 
      CONCLUSIONS: We observed statistically significant differences in utility scores 
      between depression health states. Individuals with less severe depressive symptoms 
      had on average statistically significant higher utility scores than individuals 
      suffering from more severe depressive symptomatology. In the present study, EQ-5D 
      had a larger range of values as compared to SF-6D.

TI  - Topical anaesthetics for pain control during repair of dermal laceration.

LID - CD005364
AB  - BACKGROUND: Topical local anaesthetics provide effective analgesia for patients 
      undergoing numerous superficial procedures, including repair of dermal lacerations. 
      The need for cocaine in topical anaesthetic formulations has been questioned because 
      of concern about adverse effects, thus novel preparations of cocaine-free 
      anaesthetics have been developed. This review was originally published in 2011 and 
      has been updated in 2017. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether benefits of non-invasive 
      topical anaesthetic application occur at the expense of decreased analgesic 
      efficacy. To compare the efficacy of various single-component or multi-component 
      topical anaesthetic agents for repair of dermal lacerations. To determine the 
      clinical necessity for topical application of the ester anaesthetic, cocaine. SEARCH 
      METHODS: For this updated review, we searched the following databases: Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 11), Cumulative Index to 
      Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 2010 to December 2016), Embase (2010 
      to December 2016) and MEDLINE (2010 to December 2016). We did not limit this search 
      by language or format of publication. We contacted manufacturers, international 
      scientific societies and researchers in the field. Weemailed selected journalsand 
      reviewed meta-registers of ongoing trials. For the previous version of this review, 
      we searched these databases to November 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
      topical anaesthetics for repair of dermal laceration in adult and paediatric 
      participants. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently 
      assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional 
      information when needed. We collected adverse event information from trial reports. 
      We assessed methodological risk of bias for each included study and employed the 
      GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: The 
      present updated review included 25 RCTs involving 3278 participants. The small 
      number of trials in each comparison group and the heterogeneity of outcome measures 
      precluded quantitative analysis of data for all but one outcome: pain intensity. In 
      two pooled studies, the mean self-reported visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 to 100 mm) 
      score for topical prilocaine-phenylephrine (PP) was higher than the mean 
      self-reported VAS (0 to 100 mm) score for topical tetracaine-epinephrine-cocaine 
      (TAC) by 5.59 points (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.16 to 13.35). Most trials that 
      compared infiltrated and topical anaesthetics were at high risk of bias, which is 
      likely to have affected their results. Researchers found that several cocaine-free 
      topical anaesthetics provided effective analgesic efficacy. However, data regarding 
      the efficacy of each topical agent are based mostly on single comparisons in trials 
      with unclear or high risk of bias. Mild, self-limited erythematous skin induration 
      occurred in one of 1042 participants who had undergone application of TAC. 
      Investigators reported no serious complications among any of the participants 
      treated with cocaine-based or cocaine-free topical anaesthetics. The overall quality 
      of the evidence according to the GRADE system is low owing to limitations in design 
      and implementation, imprecision of results and high probability of publication bias 
      (selective reporting of data). Additional well-designed RCTs with low risk of bias 
      are necessary before definitive conclusions can be reached. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We 
      have found two new studies published since the last version of this review was 
      prepared. We have added these studies to those previously included and have 
      conducted an updated analysis, which resulted in the same review conclusions as were 
      presented previously.Mostly descriptive analysis indicates that topical anaesthetics 
      may offer an efficacious, non-invasive means of providing analgesia before suturing 
      of dermal lacerations. Use of cocaine-based topical anaesthetics might be hard to 
      justify, given the availability of other effective topical anaesthetics without 
      cocaine. However, the overall quality of the evidence according to the GRADE system 
      is low owing to limitations in design and implementation, imprecision of results and 
      high probability of publication bias (selective reporting of data). Additional 
      well-designed RCTs with low risk of bias are necessary before definitive conclusions 
      can be reached.

TI  - 17-Hydroxyprogesterone caproate in triplet pregnancy: an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 682-90
LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.13779 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth complicates almost all triplet pregnancies and no 
      preventive strategy has proven effective. OBJECTIVE: To determine, using individual 
      patient data (IPD) meta-analysis, whether the outcome of triplet pregnancy is 
      affected by prophylactic administration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17OHPc). 
      SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched literature databases, trial registries and references 
      in published articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 
      progestogens versus control that included women with triplet pregnancies. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Investigators from identified RCTs collaborated on the 
      protocol and contributed their IPD. The primary outcome was a composite measure of 
      adverse perinatal outcome. The secondary outcome was the rate of birth before 
      32 weeks of gestation. Other pre-specified outcomes included 
      randomisation-to-delivery interval and rates of birth at <24, <28 and <34 weeks of 
      gestation. MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs of 17OHPc versus placebo included 232 mothers 
      with triplet pregnancies and their 696 offspring. Risk-of-bias scores and 
      between-study heterogeneity were low. Baseline characteristics were comparable 
      between 17OHPc and placebo groups. The rate of the composite adverse perinatal 
      outcome was similar among those treated with 17OHPc and those treated with placebo 
      (34 and 35%, respectively; risk ratio [RR] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 
      0.79-1.2). The rate of birth at <32 weeks was also similar in the two groups (35 and 
      38%, respectively; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55-1.56). There were no significant 
      between-group differences in perinatal mortality rate, randomisation-to-delivery 
      interval, or other specified outcomes. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic 17OHPc given to 
      mothers with triplet pregnancies had no significant impact on perinatal outcome or 
      pregnancy duration. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: 17-Hydroxyprogesterone caproate had no 
      significant impact on the outcome or duration of triplet pregnancy.

PG  - CD012332
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD012332.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD012332
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in 
      the treatment of pain in fibromyalgia, despite being considered not to be effective. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the analgesic efficacy, tolerability (drop-out due to adverse 
      events), and safety (serious adverse events) of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs for fibromyalgia in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and 
      Embase for randomised controlled trials from inception to January 2017. We also 
      searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical 
      trial registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised, double-blind trials of 
      two weeks' duration or longer, comparing any oral NSAID with placebo or another 
      active treatment for relief of pain in fibromyalgia, with subjective pain assessment 
      by the participant. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently 
      extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were 
      participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or 
      very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)) or moderate 
      pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on 
      PGIC), serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events; secondary 
      outcomes were adverse events, withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, and outcomes 
      relating to sleep, fatigue, and quality of life. Where pooled analysis was possible, 
      we used dichotomous data to calculate risk difference (RD) and number needed to 
      treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT), using standard methods. We 
      assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' 
      table. MAIN RESULTS: Our searches identified six randomised, double-blind studies 
      involving 292 participants in suitably characterised fibromyalgia. The mean age of 
      participants was between 39 and 50 years, and 89% to 100% were women. The initial 
      pain intensity was around 7/10 on a 0 to 10 pain scale, indicating severe pain. 
      NSAIDs tested were etoricoxib 90 mg daily, ibuprofen 2400 mg daily, naproxen 1000 mg 
      daily, and tenoxicam 20 mg daily; 146 participants received NSAID and 146 placebo. 
      The duration of treatment in the double-blind phase varied between three and eight 
      weeks.Not all studies reported all the outcomes of interest. Analyses consistently 
      showed no significant difference between NSAID and placebo: substantial benefit (at 
      least 50% pain intensity reduction) (risk difference (RD) -0.07 (95% confidence 
      interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.04) 2 studies, 146 participants; moderate benefit (at least 
      30% pain intensity reduction) (RD -0.04 (95% CI -0.16 to 0.08) 3 studies, 192 
      participants; withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.09) 4 
      studies, 230 participants; participants experiencing any adverse event (RD 0.08 (95% 
      CI -0.03 to 0.19) 4 studies, 230 participants; all-cause withdrawals (RD 0.03 (95% 
      CI -0.07 to 0.14) 3 studies, 192 participants. There were no serious adverse events 
      or deaths. Although most studies had some measures of health-related quality of 
      life, fibromyalgia impact, or other outcomes, none reported the outcomes beyond 
      saying that there was no or little difference between the treatment groups.We 
      downgraded evidence on all outcomes to very low quality, meaning that this research 
      does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the 
      effect could be substantially different is very high. This is based on the small 
      numbers of studies, participants, and events, as well as other deficiencies of 
      reporting study quality allowing possible risks of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There 
      is only a modest amount of very low-quality evidence about the use of NSAIDs in 
      fibromyalgia, and that comes from small, largely inadequate studies with potential 
      risk of bias. That bias would normally be to increase the apparent benefits of 
      NSAIDs, but no such benefits were seen. Consequently, NSAIDs cannot be regarded as 
      useful for treating fibromyalgia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Meta-analyses using individual patient data (IPD) rather than aggregated 
      data are increasingly applied to analyze sources of heterogeneity between trials and 
      have only recently been applied to unravel multicomponent, complex interventions. 
      This study reflects on methodological challenges encountered in two IPD 
      meta-analyses on self-management interventions in patients with heart failure or 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Critical reflection 
      on prior IPD meta-analyses and discussion of literature. RESULTS: Experience from 
      two IPD meta-analyses illustrates methodological challenges. Despite close 
      collaboration with principal investigators, assessing the effect of characteristics 
      of complex interventions on the outcomes of trials is compromised by lack of 
      sufficient details on intervention characteristics and limited data on fidelity and 
      adherence. Furthermore, trials collected baseline variables in a highly diverse way, 
      limiting the possibilities to study subgroups of patients in a consistent manner. 
      Possible solutions are proposed based on lessons learnt from the methodological 
      challenges. CONCLUSION: Future researchers of complex interventions should pay 
      considerable attention to the causal mechanism underlying the intervention and 
      conducting process evaluations. Future researchers on IPD meta-analyses of complex 
      interventions should carefully consider their own causal assumptions and 
      availability of required data in eligible trials before undertaking such 
      resource-intensive IPD meta-analysis.

TI  - Clinical Impact and Course of Anticoagulant-Related Major Bleeding in Cancer 
      Patients.
PG  - 174-181
LID - 10.1160/TH17-04-0274 [doi]
AB  - Cancer patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) have a two- to six-fold increased 
      risk of anticoagulant-related major bleeding events compared with VTE patients 
      without cancer. It is unknown whether major bleeding events are more severe in 
      cancer patients than in those without cancer. Individual patient data from four 
      randomized phase III trials that compared factor Xa inhibitors and vitamin K 
      antagonists for the treatment of VTE were used to compare the severity of major 
      bleeding events in patients with and without cancer. Using predefined criteria, the 
      severity of the clinical presentation and course of major bleeding events were 
      classified into four categories of increasing severity. A one-stage meta-analysis 
      was used to evaluate the effect of cancer on the severity of the clinical 
      presentation and course by estimating crude odds ratios (ORs) and ORs adjusted for 
      age, sex and anticoagulant type with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The study group 
      comprised 290 patients with major bleeding, of whom 50 (17%) had cancer. The 
      clinical presentation was judged to be severe (category 3 or 4) in 38% of patients 
      with cancer and 44% of patients without cancer (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 
      0.47-1.72). The clinical course was found to be severe in 20 and 25% of patients 
      with and without cancer, respectively (adjusted OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.35-1.61). The 
      present study suggests that the clinical presentation and course of 
      anticoagulant-related major bleeding events are not more severe in cancer patients 
      than in patients without cancer. This may be reassuring for physicians who treat 
      cancer patients with anticoagulant-related bleeding.

TI  - Lipid-lowering efficacy of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab (AMG 145) in patients with 
      type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of individual patient data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes have increased cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 
      monoclonal antibodies have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol and other lipids, 
      but specific efficacy for patients with diabetes is unknown. We compared the effect 
      of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab on lipid parameters in patients with and without 
      type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We did a random-effects meta-analysis of randomised 
      clinical trials comparing the efficacy of evolocumab, placebo, and ezetimibe to 
      improve lipid parameters in adult patients (age 18-80 years) with or without type 2 
      diabetes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase to identify eligible 12-week, phase 3 
      trials published between Jan 1, 2012, and Feb 28, 2015. We excluded trials that 
      included patients who had homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. All analyses 
      were based on individual participant data. We used DerSimonian and Laird 
      random-effects meta-analyses to compare the mean changes from baseline in 
      concentrations of LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, 
      triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), and HDL cholesterol at 12 weeks for evolocumab, 
      placebo, and ezetimibe. We also assessed the effect of evolocumab therapy compared 
      with placebo across subgroups of patients based on glycaemia, insulin use, renal 
      function, and cardiovascular disease status at baseline. RESULTS: Three trials met 
      our inclusion criteria, and included 413 patients with type 2 diabetes and 2119 
      patients without type 2 diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes evolocumab caused 
      mean reductions in LDL cholesterol concentration that were 60% (95% CI 51-69) versus 
      placebo and 39% (32-47) versus ezetimibe. In patients without type 2 diabetes, 
      evolocumab caused mean reductions in LDL cholesterol that were 66% (62-70) versus 
      placebo and 40% (36-45) versus ezetimibe. In patients with type 2 diabetes, 
      evolocumab was associated with reductions in non-HDL cholesterol (55% [47-63] vs 
      placebo and 34% [26-41] vs ezetimibe), total cholesterol (38% [32-44] vs placebo and 
      24% [16-31] vs ezetimibe), and lipoprotein(a) (31% [25-37] vs placebo and 26% 
      [16-35] vs ezetimibe), and an increase in HDL cholesterol (7% [4-11] vs placebo and 
      8% [4-13] vs ezetimibe). Findings were similar across diabetes subgroups based on 
      glycaemia, insulin use, renal function, and cardiovascular disease status. 
      INTERPRETATION: Evolocumab markedly reduces atherogenic lipoproteins in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes, an effect that is consistent across subgroups and similar to 
      that seen in patients without type 2 diabetes. Results from ongoing cardiovascular 
      outcome trials of PCSK9 inhibitors will provide additional data to inform the use of 
      these drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes. FUNDING: Amgen.

      patient data meta-analysis from multiple randomized controlled trials. We obtained 
      individual patient data sets for 7 of 10 eligible trials (2,292 of 2,764 
      participants). For the remaining 3 trials, time-to-event data were imputed based on 
      follow-up periods described in their original reports. We included all trials that 
      compared periprocedural intravenous sodium bicarbonate to periprocedural intravenous 
      sodium chloride in patients undergoing coronary angiography or other intra-arterial 
      interventions. Included trials were determined by consensus according to predefined 
      eligibility criteria. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality hazard, defined as 
      time from randomization to death. In 10 trials with a total of 2,764 participants, 
      sodium bicarbonate was associated with lower mortality hazard than sodium chloride 
      at 1 year (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41 to 0.89, p = 0.011). 
      Although periprocedural sodium bicarbonate was associated with a reduction in the 
      incidence of CAN (relative risk 0.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.91, p = 0.003), there exists 
      a statistically significant interaction between the effect on mortality and the 
      occurrence of CAN (hazard ratio 5.65, 95% CI 3.58 to 8.92, p <0.001) for up to 
      1-year mortality. Periprocedural intravenous sodium bicarbonate seems to be 
      associated with a reduction in long-term mortality in patients undergoing coronary 
      angiography or other intra-arterial interventions.

TI  - Three-Year Outcomes With the Absorb Bioresorbable Scaffold: Individual-Patient-Data 
      Meta-Analysis From the ABSORB Randomized Trials.
PG  - 464-479
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031843 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) completely resorbs 
      within 3 years after coronary artery implantation. The safety and effectiveness of 
      BVS through this critical 3-year period have not been characterized. METHODS: We 
      performed an individual-patient-data pooled meta-analysis of the 4 randomized ABSORB 
      trials in which 3389 patients with coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to 
      everolimus-eluting Absorb BVS (n=2164) or cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents 
      (n=1225). The primary efficacy outcome measure was target lesion failure (cardiac 
      mortality, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion 
      revascularization), and the primary safety outcome measure was device thrombosis. 
      RESULTS: BVS compared with cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents resulted in 
      higher 3-year rates of target lesion failure (11.7% versus 8.1%; risk ratio [RR], 
      1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.73; P=0.006), driven by greater target 
      vessel myocardial infarction (7.8% versus 4.2%; RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.26-2.35; 
      P=0.0006) and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (6.6% versus 4.4%; RR, 
      1.44; 95% CI, 1.05-1.98; P=0.02), with comparable cardiac mortality (1.1% versus 
      1.1%; RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.47-1.88; P=0.85). Device thrombosis rates through 3 years 
      were also higher with BVS (2.4% versus 0.6%; RR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.70-8.11; P=0.001). 
      Between 1 and 3 years, target lesion failure rates (6.1% versus 3.9%; P=0.02) and 
      device thrombosis rates (1.1% versus 0.0%; P<0.0001) were higher with BVS than 
      cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents. CONCLUSIONS: In the present 
      individual-patient-data pooled meta-analysis of the ABSORB trials, BVS was 
      associated with increased rates of target lesion failure and device thrombosis 
      between 1 and 3 years and cumulatively through 3 years of follow-up compared with 
      everolimus-eluting stents. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

TI  - Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: An Invaluable Tool for 
      Clinical Diagnosis and Trial Enrichment.
PG  - S281-S287
LID - 10.3233/JAD-179910 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 
      around 35 million people worldwide. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers entered the 
      diagnostic criteria as support for early diagnosis. The classical biochemical 
      signature of AD includes total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), and the 42 
      amino acid peptide (Aβ42) of amyloid-β. Recent observations suggest that the use of 
      CSF Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio rather than CSF Aβ42 alone could contribute to reduce 
      inter-laboratory variation in Aβ values and increasing diagnostic performance of the 
      CSF AD biomarkers in routine practice. However, research efforts aimed at enriching 
      the CSF biomarker panel are ongoing. The CSF AD signature is also crucial for the 
      design of clinical trials for AD, since it best guarantees AD pathology as the cause 
      of cognitive impairment. Accordingly, CSF biomarkers have been now reported in the 
      inclusion criteria of Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III clinical trials as enrichment 
      strategy. So far, one of the most important reasons for the failure of AD clinical 
      trials was the inclusion of participants with unlikely AD pathology. In order to 
      implement the use of CSF biomarkers in AD routine diagnostic work-up and as accepted 
      strategy for enriching trial populations, inter-laboratory variability should be 
      minimized. Increasing efforts should also be devoted to promote data sharing 
      practices, encouraging individual participant data meta-analyses.

TI  - Surrogate endpoints in advanced sarcoma trials: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 34617-34627
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.26166 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alternative endpoints to overall survival (OS) are frequently used to 
      assess treatment efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCT). Their properties in 
      terms of surrogate outcomes for OS need to be assessed. We evaluated the surrogate 
      properties of progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-progression (TTP) and 
      time-to-treatment failure (TTF) in advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS). RESULTS: A 
      total of 21 trials originally met the selection criteria and 14 RCTs (N = 2846) were 
      included in the analysis. Individual-level associations were moderate (highest for 
      12-month PFS: Spearman's rho = 0.66; 95% CI [0.63; 0.68]). Trial-level associations 
      were ranked as low for the three endpoints as per the IQWiG criterion. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis using individual-patient data (IPD). Phase 
      II/III RCTs evaluating therapies for adults with advanced STS were eligible. We 
      estimated the individual- and the trial-level associations between then candidate 
      surrogates and OS. Statistical methods included weighted linear regression and the 
      two-stage model introduced by Buyse and Burzykowski. The strength of the trial-level 
      association was ranked according to the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency 
      in Health Care (IQWiG) guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support strong 
      surrogate properties of PFS, TTP and TTF for OS in advanced STS.

      Undergoing Short-Term Dual Antiplatelet Therapy: An Individual Participant Data 
      Analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study sought to evaluate the presence of a clinically relevant 
      rebound phenomenon after dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) discontinuation in 
      randomized trials. BACKGROUND: It is currently unknown whether clopidogrel 
      discontinuation after short-term DAPT is associated with an early hazard of ischemic 
      events. METHODS: The authors performed an individual participant data analysis and 
      aggregate meta-analysis. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac and 
      cerebrovascular events (MACCE), defined as the composite of cardiac death, 
      myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke. RESULTS: The study included 11,473 PCI 
      patients with individual participant data from 6 randomized trials comparing 
      short-term DAPT (3 or 6 months) versus long-term DAPT (12 months or more). During 
      the first 90 days following clopidogrel discontinuation, there was no significant 
      increase in the risk of MACCE between patients randomized to short-term DAPT 
      compared with long-term DAPT (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      0.71 to 1.98; p = 0.52; absolute risk difference 0.10%; 95% CI: -0.16% to 0.36%). 
      The risk of MI or stent thrombosis was similar among patients randomized to 
      short-term DAPT versus long-term DAPT (HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.46 to 1.90; p = 0.85). In 
      the aggregate data meta-analysis of 11 trials including 38,919 patients, a higher 
      risk of early MACCE was observed after long-term (≥12 months) DAPT duration (HR: 
      2.28; 95% CI: 1.69 to 3.09; p < 0.001) but not short-term (<12 months) DAPT duration 
      (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.74; p for interaction = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Among 
      patients undergoing PCI with predominantly new-generation DES, discontinuation of 
      clopidogrel after 3 or 6 months DAPT duration was not associated with an early 
      increase in adverse clinical events. An early increase in MACCE was observed after 
      long-term (≥12 months) DAPT exposure.

AB  - Monitoring glycemic control is useful not only in the primary prevention of stroke 
      in diabetics, but also in the rehabilitation from and secondary prevention of 
      stroke. In an often functionally and neurocognitively impaired population, however, 
      poor compliance with treatment regimens is a major problem. Wireless, telemonitoring 
      glucometers - often integrated into the patient's healthcare system - offer a 
      solution to the compliance issue. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of 
      telemonitoring technologies in improving long-term glycemic control. A search on 
      www.clinicaltrials.gov, using keywords such as "telemonitoring" and "self-care 
      device" was performed, and five trials were identified that compared hemoglobin A1c 
      (HbA1c) levels of a group receiving standard care (controls) to a group receiving a 
      telemonitoring intervention. Four of the five studies showed a greater reduction in 
      HbA1c in the intervention group compared to controls at 6 months, although only one 
      was statistically significant. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies 
      (I(2)=69.5%, p=0.02), and the random effects model estimated the aggregate effect 
      size for mean difference in reduction of HbA1c levels to be 0.08% (95% confidence 
      interval -0.12% to 0.28%), which was not statistically significant (p=0.42). The 
      varying results may be due to specific factors in the trials that contributed to 
      their large heterogeneity, and further trials are needed to support the role of 
      telemonitoring in improving diabetes management in this population. Nonetheless, in 
      the future telemonitoring may substantially help patients at risk of ischemic stroke 
      and those who require close glucose monitoring.

TI  - Serious Adverse Events with Bevacizumab or Ranibizumab for Age-related Macular 
      Degeneration: Meta-analysis of Individual Patient Data.
PG  - 375-381
LID - 10.1016/j.oret.2016.12.015 [doi]
AB  - TOPIC: A comparison between ranibizumab and bevacizumab of the incidence of systemic 
      serious adverse events (SAEs) among patients with neovascular age-related macular 
      degeneration (nAMD) who participated in a large-scale randomized trial. Use of 
      individual patient data, rather than aggregate data, allowed adjustment for strong 
      predictors of SAEs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Relative safety of ranibizumab and 
      bevacizumab is important in choosing an anti-VEGF drug for the hundreds of thousands 
      of patients with nAMD treated each year worldwide. METHODS: Results of a Cochrane 
      aggregate meta-analysis of the relative efficacy and safety of bevacizumab and 
      ranibizumab that used searches of bibliographic databases and clinical trial 
      registries as of March 14, 2014 and hand searching were reviewed to identify 6 
      large-scale, multicenter clinical trials. Individual patient data on SAEs, assigned 
      drug and dosing regimen, and baseline prognostic factors were requested from the 
      leaders of the 6 trials. A two-stage approach was used to estimate relative risks 
      and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from Cox proportional hazards models adjusting 
      for baseline prognostic factors. The primary outcome measure was development of ≥1 
      SAE; secondary outcome measures were death, arteriothrombotic events, events 
      associated with systemic anti-VEGF therapy, and events not associated with systemic 
      anti-VEGF therapy. RESULTS: Individual patient data were received from 5 trials to 
      provide information on 3052 patients. There were no large imbalances between drug 
      groups on baseline factors. The adjusted relative risk (95% CI) for bevacizumab 
      relative to ranibizumab was 1.06 [(0.84, 1.35); p=0.61] for ≥1 SAEs. For secondary 
      outcomes, adjusted relative risks were 0.99 [ (0.69, 1.43); p=0.97] for death, 0.89 
      [ (0.62, 1.28); p=0.53] for arteriothrombotic events, 1.10 [ (0.81, 1.50); p=0.54] 
      for events related to anti-VEGF treatment, and 1.11 [ (0.87, 1.40); p=0.40] for 
      events not related to anti-VEGF treatment. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the 
      absence of large differences in risk of systemic serious adverse events between 
      these two anti-VEGF drugs; i.e., relative risks of ≥1.5 are unlikely. Because 
      additional head-to-head trials are unlikely, any further investigation of 
      differential risk between anti-VEGF agents will only be achieved though 
      post-marketing surveillance or through the interrogation of healthcare databases.

TI  - Evaluating progestogens for prevention of preterm birth international collaborative 
      (EPPPIC) individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis: protocol.
PG  - 235

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the most common cause of death and harm to newborn 
      babies. Babies that are born early may have difficulties at birth and experience 
      health problems during early childhood. Despite extensive study, there is still 
      uncertainty about the effectiveness of progestogen (medications that are similar to 
      the natural hormone progesterone) in preventing or delaying preterm birth, and in 
      improving birth outcomes. The Evaluating Progestogen for Prevention of Preterm birth 
      International Collaborative (EPPPIC) project aims to reduce uncertainty about the 
      specific conditions in which progestogen may (or may not) be effective in preventing 
      or delaying preterm birth and improving birth outcomes. METHODS: The design of the 
      study involves international collaborative individual participant data meta-analysis 
      comprising systematic review, re-analysis, and synthesis of trial datasets. 
      Inclusion criteria are as follows: randomized controlled trials comparing 
      progestogen versus placebo or non-intervention, or comparing different types of 
      progestogen, in asymptomatic women at risk of preterm birth. Main outcomes are as 
      follows; fetal/infant death, preterm birth or fetal death (<=37 weeks, <=34 weeks, 
      <= 28 weeks), serious neonatal complications or fetal/infant death, neurosensory 
      disability (measured at 18 months or later) or infant/child death, important 
      maternal morbidity, or maternal death. In statistical methods, IPD will be 
      synthesized across trials using meta-analysis. Both 'two-stage' models (where effect 
      estimates are calculated for each trial and subsequently pooled in a meta-analysis) 
      and 'one-stage' models (where all IPD from all trials are analyzed in one step, 
      while accounting for the clustering of participants within trials) will be used. If 
      sufficient suitable data are available, a network meta-analysis will compare all 
      types of progesterone and routes of administration extending the one-stage models to 
      include multiple treatment arms. DISCUSSION: EPPPIC is an international 
      collaborative project being conducted by the forming EPPPIC group, which includes 
      trial investigators, an international secretariat, and the research project team. 
      Results, which are intended to contribute to improvements in maternal and child 
      health, are expected to be publicly available in mid 2018. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

AB  - RATIONALE: A number of randomized trials are underway, which will address the 
      effects of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on aortic root enlargement and a 
      range of other end points in patients with Marfan syndrome. If individual 
      participant data from these trials were to be combined, a meta-analysis of the 
      resulting data, totaling approximately 2,300 patients, would allow estimation across 
      a number of trials of the treatment effects both of ARB therapy and of β-blockade. 
      Such an analysis would also allow estimation of treatment effects in particular 
      subgroups of patients on a range of end points of interest and would allow a more 
      powerful estimate of the effects of these treatments on a composite end point of 
      several clinical outcomes than would be available from any individual trial. DESIGN: 
      A prospective, collaborative meta-analysis based on individual patient data from all 
      randomized trials in Marfan syndrome of (i) ARBs versus placebo (or open-label 
      control) and (ii) ARBs versus β-blockers will be performed. A prospective study 
      design, in which the principal hypotheses, trial eligibility criteria, analyses, and 
      methods are specified in advance of the unblinding of the component trials, will 
      help to limit bias owing to data-dependent emphasis on the results of particular 
      trials. The use of individual patient data will allow for analysis of the effects of 
      ARBs in particular patient subgroups and for time-to-event analysis for clinical 
      outcomes. The meta-analysis protocol summarized in this report was written on behalf 
      of the Marfan Treatment Trialists' Collaboration and finalized in late 2012, without 
      foreknowledge of the results of any component trial, and will be made available 
      online (http://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/research/meta-trials).

      angioplasty: A pooled patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several concerns have emerged about the higher risk of very late stent 
      thrombosis (ST) with first generation drug-eluting stent (DES) especially among 
      STEMI patients. Newer generation DES has demonstrated to reduce ST at mid-term 
      follow-up. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to perform an individual 
      patient's data meta-analysis of trials comparing 1st generation DES vs. 2nd 
      generation DES (everolimus-eluting stent, EES) in patients undergoing primary 
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI. METHODS: We performed a formal 
      search of electronic databases (MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and scientific session 
      presentations from January 2010 to June 2016. We included all completed randomized 
      trials comparing 1st vs. EES for patient presenting with STEMI. RESULTS: Individual 
      patients data were obtained from 3 trials, including a total of 1581 patients (686 
      or 43.4% randomized to 1st generation DES and 895 or 56.4% randomized to EES). At 
      long-term follow-up (1584±588days), EES did not significantly reduce mortality 
      (7.8.% vs 11.7%, HR [95%CI]=0.77 [0.52, 1.13], p=0.18, p(heterogeneity)=0.93), 
      cardiac mortality (6.2% vs 7.6%, HR [95%CI]=0.90 [0.56, 1.44], p=0.65, 
      p(heterogeneity)=0.85), and reinfarction (8.1% versus 11.2%, respectively; HR 
      [95%CI]=0.74 [0.51, 1.07], p=0.11, p(heterogeneity)=0.52). However, EES 
      significantly reduced the occurrence of ST (3.4% versus 6.1% respectively, HR 
      [95%CI]=0.56 [0.32, 0.97], p=0.04, p(heterogeneity)=0.42) and target vessel 
      revascularization (TVR) (14.2% versus 20.1%; HR [95%CI]=0.63 [0.42, 0.96], p=0.03, 
      p(heterogeneity)=0.55). Landmark analysis showed more consistent benefits in ST with 
      EES within 1year, whereas benefits in TVR were mostly observed later than 1year. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The present pooled patient-level meta-analysis demonstrates that among 
      STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI, EES as compared to 1st generation DES is 
      associated with a significant reduction in ST and TVR at long-term follow-up.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of combined intraventricular fibrinolysis with lumbar drainage 
      for prevention of permanent shunt dependency after intracerebral hemorrhage with 
      severe ventricular involvement: A randomized trial and individual patient data 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 93-103
LID - 10.1002/ana.24834 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a negative prognostic factor in 
      intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is associated with permanent shunt dependency in 
      a substantial proportion of patients post-ICH. IVH treatment by intraventricular 
      fibrinolysis (IVF) was recently linked to reduced mortality rates in the CLEAR III 
      study and IVF represents a safe and effective strategy to hasten clot resolution 
      that may reduce shunt rates. Additionally, promising results from observational 
      studies reported reductions in shunt dependency for a combined treatment approach of 
      IVF plus lumbar drains (LDs). The present randomized, controlled trial investigated 
      efficacy and safety of a combined strategy-IVF plus LD versus IVF alone-on shunt 
      dependency in patients with ICH and severe IVH. METHODS: This randomized, 
      open-label, parallel-group study included patients aged 18 to 85 years, prehospital 
      modified Rankin Scale ≤3, ICH volume < 60ml, Glasgow Coma Scale of <9, and severe 
      IVH with tamponade of the third and fourth ventricles requiring placement of 
      external ventricular drainage (EVD). Over a 3-year recruitment period, patients were 
      allocated to either standard treatment (control group receiving IVF consisting of 
      1mg of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator every 8 hours until clot 
      clearance of third and fourth ventricles) or a combined treatment approach of IVF 
      and-upon clot clearance of third and fourth ventricles-subsequent placement of an LD 
      for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; intervention group). The primary endpoint 
      consisted of permanent shunt placement indicated after a total of three unsuccessful 
      EVD clamping attempts or need for CSF drainage longer than 14 days in both groups. 
      Secondary endpoints included IVF- and LD-related safety, such as bleeding or 
      infections, and functional outcome at 90 and 180 days. Conducted endpoint analyses 
      used individual patient data meta-analyses. The study was registered at 
      clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01041950). RESULTS: The trial was stopped upon predefined 
      interim analysis after 30 patients because of significant efficacy of tested 
      intervention. The primary endpoint was analyzed without dropouts and was reached in 
      43% (7 of 16) of the control group versus 0% (0 of 14) of the intervention group 
      (p = 0.007). Meta-analyses were based on overall 97 patients, 45 patients receiving 
      IVF plus LD versus 42 with IVF only. Meta-analyses on shunt dependency showed an 
      absolute risk reduction of 24% for the intervention (LD, 2.2% [1 of 45] vs no-LD, 
      26.2% [11 of 42]; odds ratio [OR] = 0.062; confidence interval [CI], 0.011-0.361; 
      p = 0.002). Secondary endpoints did not show significant differences for CSF 
      infections (OR = 0.869;CI, 0.445-1.695; p = 0.680) and functional outcome at 90 days 
      (OR = 0.478; CI, 0.190-1.201; p = 0.116), yet bleeding complications were 
      significantly reduced in favor of the intervention (OR = 0.401; CI, 0.302-0.532; 
      p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: The present trial and individual patient data 
      meta-analyses provide evidence that, in patients with severe IVH, as compared to IVF 
      alone, a combined approach of IVF plus LD treatment is feasible and safe and 
      significantly reduces rates of permanent shunt dependency for aresorptive 
      hydrocephalus post-ICH. ANN NEUROL 2017;81:93-103.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Safety of Aspirin for a High-Dose, Multiple-Day Treatment Regimen: 
      A Meta-Analysis of Three Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 263-269
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Aspirin is a commonly used over-the-counter (OTC) agent for the 
      symptomatic treatment of acute pain, fever, or the common cold, but data regarding 
      safety in this context are limited. In order to characterize the safety of aspirin 
      beyond single-dose or long-term use data, we conducted a meta-analysis of 
      multiple-dose, multiple-day studies of OTC aspirin at a label-approved dosage. 
      METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient data from three 
      Bayer-sponsored studies. The meta-analysis was performed in 2015; the individual 
      studies were conducted between 2008 and 2012 and were of a randomized, 
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled design. Patients received a minimum dosage of 
      aspirin of 2000 mg/day over at least 3 days. The endpoints were patient-reported 
      adverse events (AEs) with an emphasis on the system organ class gastrointestinal 
      system. Event incidences were estimated and an analysis of the odds ratios (ORs) and 
      risk differences (RDs) of aspirin versus placebo were performed. RESULTS: Of the 819 
      patients included, 433 were treated with aspirin and 386 were treated with placebo. 
      The majority of patients (85.7 %) received a median dose of aspirin of 3000 mg/day 
      for 3 days. The incidence of the overall AEs was low and rates were comparable 
      between the aspirin (10.9 %) and placebo (12.4 %) groups [OR: 0.86 (95 % confidence 
      interval [CI] 0.56, 1.34); RD: -1.49 (95 % CI -6.01, 3.03)]. Gastrointestinal AEs 
      were more common in subjects treated with aspirin (7.4 %) than with placebo (5.4 %), 
      and although this difference did not reach statistical significance, a trend towards 
      increased risk was observed with aspirin use [OR: 1.41 (95 % CI 0.78, 2.54); RD: 
      2.00 (95 % CI -1.35, 5.35)]. Nausea, upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and diarrhea 
      were the most frequently reported gastrointestinal AEs. There were no reports of 
      serious gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, or ulceration. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The multiple-dose regimen of aspirin used for several days according to 
      the OTC label is well-tolerated by otherwise healthy non-elderly subjects for 
      short-term and symptomatic treatment of pain, fever, and the common cold. There were 
      no reports of serious gastrointestinal complications in either of the groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer. 
      Numerous clinical studies have reported that the combination of carboplatin and S-1 
      (CS) can be used to treat NSCLC effectively. However, no systematic review has been 
      conducted to assess its efficacy and safety for NSCLC. This systematic review aims 
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CS for treatment of patients with NSCLC. 
      METHODS: This study will retrieve the following electronic databases from inception 
      to the February 1, 2019: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDILINE, CINAHL, AMED, and 4 
      Chinese databases without any language limitations. This systematic review will 
      include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case-control studies for assessing 
      the efficacy and safety of CS for the treatment of NSCLC. Cochrane risk of bias will 
      be used as methodological quality assessment for each qualified study. The RevMan 
      V.5.3 software will be utilized to synthesize the data and conduct the meta-analysis 
      if it is allowed. The data will be pooled by using the random-effects model or 
      fixed-effects model. RESULTS: The primary outcome is overall response rate. The 
      secondary outcomes are overall survival, progression-free survival, the disease 
      control rate, and any adverse events. CONCLUSION: It will provide latest evidence to 
      determine the efficacy and safety of CS for treatment of patients with NSCLC. ETHICS 
      AND DISSEMINATION: No research ethic approval is needed in this study because this 
      study will not analyze individual patient data. The results are expected to 
      disseminate through peer-reviewed journals. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO 
      CRD42019124860.

TI  - Continuing or Temporarily Stopping Prestroke Antihypertensive Medication in Acute 
      Stroke: An Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 933-941
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.116.07982 [doi]
AB  - Over 50% of patients are already taking blood pressure-lowering therapy on hospital 
      admission for acute stroke. An individual patient data meta-analysis from randomized 
      controlled trials was undertaken to determine the effect of continuation versus 
      temporarily stopping preexisting antihypertensive medication in acute stroke. Key 
      databases were searched for trials against the following inclusion criteria: 
      randomized design; stroke onset ≤48 hours; investigating the effect of continuation 
      versus stopping prestroke antihypertensive medication; and follow-up of ≥2 weeks. 
      Two randomized controlled trials were identified and included in this meta-analysis 
      of individual patient data from 2860 patients with ≤48 hours of acute stroke. Risk 
      of bias in each study was low. In adjusted logistic regression and multiple 
      regression analyses (using random effects), we found no significant association 
      between continuation of prestroke antihypertensive therapy (versus stopping) and 
      risk of death or dependency at final follow-up: odds ratio 0.96 (95% confidence 
      interval, 0.80-1.14). No significant associations were found between continuation 
      (versus stopping) of therapy and secondary outcomes at final follow-up. Analyses for 
      death and dependency in prespecified subgroups revealed no significant associations 
      with continuation versus temporarily stopping therapy, with the exception of 
      patients randomized ≤12 hours, in whom a difference favoring stopping treatment met 
      statistical significance. We found no significant benefit with continuation of 
      antihypertensive treatment in the acute stroke period. Therefore, there is no 
      urgency to administer preexisting antihypertensive therapy in the first few hours or 
      days after stroke, unless indicated for other comorbid conditions.

TI  - Association Between Chronic Physical Conditions and the Effectiveness of 
      Collaborative Care for Depression: An Individual Participant Data Meta-analysis.
PG  - 978-89
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.1794 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Collaborative care is an intensive care model involving several health 
      care professionals working together, typically a physician, a case manager, and a 
      mental health professional. Meta-analyses of aggregate data have shown that 
      collaborative care is particularly effective in people with depression and comorbid 
      chronic physical conditions. However, only participant-level analyses can rigorously 
      test whether the treatment effect is influenced by participant characteristics, such 
      as chronic physical conditions. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the effectiveness of 
      collaborative care for depression is moderated by the presence, type, and number of 
      chronic physical conditions. DATA SOURCES: Data were obtained from MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials, and references from relevant systematic reviews. The search and collection 
      of eligible studies was ongoing until May 22, 2015. STUDY SELECTION: This was an 
      update to a previous meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers were involved in the 
      study selection process. Randomized clinical trials that compared the effectiveness 
      of collaborative care with usual care in adults with depression and reported 
      measured changes in depression severity symptoms at 4 to 6 months after 
      randomization were included in the analysis. Key search terms included depression, 
      dysthymia, anxiety, panic, phobia, obsession, compulsion, posttraumatic, care 
      management, case management, collaborative care, enhanced care, and managed care. 
      DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Individual participant data on baseline demographics 
      and chronic physical conditions as well as baseline and follow-up depression 
      severity symptoms were requested from authors of the eligible studies. One-step 
      meta-analysis of individual participant data using appropriate mixed-effects models 
      was performed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Continuous outcomes of depression 
      severity symptoms measured using self-reported or observer-rated measures. RESULTS: 
      Data sets from 31 randomized clinical trials including 36 independent comparisons 
      (N = 10 962 participants) were analyzed. Individual participant data analyses found 
      no significant interaction effects, indicating that the presence (interaction 
      coefficient, 0.02 [95% CI, -0.10 to 0.13]), numbers (interaction coefficient, 0.01 
      [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.02]), and types of chronic physical conditions do not influence 
      the treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is evidence that 
      collaborative care is effective for people with depression alone and also for people 
      with depression and chronic physical conditions. Existing guidance that recommends 
      limiting collaborative care to people with depression and physical comorbidities is 
      not supported by this individual participant data meta-analysis.

TI  - Glycemic Control During Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Versus Multiple 
      Daily Insulin Injections in Type 2 Diabetes: Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis 
      and Meta-regression of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 715-722
LID - 10.2337/dc16-2201 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare glycemic control during continuous subcutaneous insulin 
      infusion (CSII) and multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) in people with type 2 
      diabetes to identify patient characteristics that determine those best treated by 
      CSII. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were selected 
      comparing HbA(1c) during CSII versus MDI in people with type 2 diabetes. Data 
      sources included Cochrane database and Ovid Medline. We explored patient-level 
      determinants of final HbA(1c) level and insulin dose using Bayesian meta-regression 
      models of individual patient data and summary effects using two-step meta-analysis. 
      Hypoglycemia data were unavailable. RESULTS: Five trials were identified, with 287 
      patients randomized to receive MDI and 303 to receive CSII. Baseline HbA(1c) was the 
      best determinant of final HbA(1c): HbA(1c) difference (%) = 1.575 - (0.216 [95% 
      credible interval 0.371-0.043] × baseline HbA(1c)) for all trials, but with largest 
      effect in the trial with prerandomization optimization of control. Baseline insulin 
      dose was best predictor of final insulin dose: insulin dose difference (units/kg) = 
      0.1245 - (0.382 [0.510-0.254] × baseline insulin dose). Overall HbA(1c) difference 
      was -0.40% (-0.86 to 0.05 [-4.4 mmol/mol (-9.4 to 0.6)]). Overall insulin dose was 
      reduced by -0.25 units/kg (-0.31 to -0.19) (26% reduction on CSII), and by -24.0 
      units/day (-30.6 to -17.5). Mean weight did not differ between treatments (0.08 kg 
      [-0.33 to 0.48]). CONCLUSIONS: CSII achieves better glycemic control than MDI in 
      people with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, with ∼26% reduction in insulin 
      requirements and no weight change. The best effect is in those worst controlled and 
      with the highest insulin dose at baseline.

TI  - Baseline data of parasite clearance in patients with falciparum malaria treated with 
      an artemisinin derivative: an individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 359
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0874-1 [doi]
LID - 359
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum manifests as slow 
      parasite clearance but this measure is also influenced by host immunity, initial 
      parasite biomass and partner drug efficacy. This study collated data from clinical 
      trials of artemisinin derivatives in falciparum malaria with frequent parasite 
      counts to provide reference parasite clearance estimates stratified by location, 
      treatment and time, to examine host factors affecting parasite clearance, and to 
      assess the relationships between parasite clearance and risk of recrudescence during 
      follow-up. METHODS: Data from 24 studies, conducted from 1996 to 2013, with frequent 
      parasite counts were pooled. Parasite clearance half-life (PC1/2) was estimated 
      using the WWARN Parasite Clearance Estimator. Random effects regression models 
      accounting for study and site heterogeneity were used to explore factors affecting 
      PC1/2 and risk of recrudescence within areas with reported delayed parasite 
      clearance (western Cambodia, western Thailand after 2000, southern Vietnam, southern 
      Myanmar) and in all other areas where parasite populations are artemisinin 
      sensitive. RESULTS: PC1/2 was estimated in 6975 patients, 3288 of whom also had 
      treatment outcomes evaluate d during 28-63 days follow-up, with 93 (2.8 %) 
      PCR-confirmed recrudescences. In areas with artemisinin-sensitive parasites, the 
      median PC1/2 following three-day artesunate treatment (4 mg/kg/day) ranged from 1.8 
      to 3.0 h and the proportion of patients with PC1/2 >5 h from 0 to 10 %. Artesunate 
      doses of 4 mg/kg/day decreased PC1/2 by 8.1 % (95 % CI 3.2-12.6) compared to 2 
      mg/kg/day, except in populations with delayed parasite clearance. PC1/2 was longer 
      in children and in patients with fever or anaemia at enrolment. Long PC1/2 (HR = 
      2.91, 95 % CI 1.95-4.34 for twofold increase, p < 0.001) and high initial 
      parasitaemia (HR = 2.23, 95 % CI 1.44-3.45 for tenfold increase, p < 0.001) were 
      associated independently with an increased risk of recrudescence. In western 
      Cambodia, the region with the highest prevalence of artemisinin resistance, there 
      was no evidence for increasing PC1/2 since 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors affect 
      PC1/2. As substantial heterogeneity in parasite clearance exists between locations, 
      early detection of artemisinin resistance requires reference PC1/2 data. Studies 
      with frequent parasite count measurements to characterize PC1/2 should be 
      encouraged. In western Cambodia, where PC1/2 values are longest, there is no 
      evidence for recent emergence of higher levels of artemisinin resistance.

TI  - Trajectories of relapse in randomised, placebo-controlled trials of treatment 
      discontinuation in major depressive disorder: an individual patient-level data 
      meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding patterns of relapse in patients who respond to 
      antidepressant treatment can inform strategies for prevention of relapse. We aimed 
      to identify distinct trajectories of depression severity, assess whether similar or 
      different trajectory classes exist for patients who continued or discontinued active 
      treatment, and test whether clinical predictors of trajectory class membership exist 
      using pooled data from clinical trials. METHODS: We analysed individual patient data 
      from four double-blind discontinuation clinical trials of duloxetine or fluoxetine 
      versus placebo in major depression from before 2012 (n=1462). We modelled 
      trajectories of relapse up to 26 weeks during double-blind treatment. Trajectories 
      of depression severity, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, 
      were identified in the entire sample, and separately in groups in which 
      antidepressants had been continued or discontinued, using growth mixture models. 
      Predictors of trajectory class membership were assessed with weighted logistic 
      regression. FINDINGS: We identified similar relapse trajectories and two 
      trajectories of stable depression scores in the normal range on active medication 
      and on placebo. Active treatment significantly lowered the odds of membership in the 
      relapse trajectory (odds ratio 0·47, 95% CI 0·37-0·61), whereas female sex (1·56, 
      1·23-2·06), shorter length of time with clinical response by 1 week (1·10, 
      1·06-1·15), and higher Clinical Global Impression score at baseline (1·28, 
      1·01-1·62) increased the odds. Overall, the protective effect of antidepressant 
      medication relative to placebo on the risk of being classified as a relapser was 
      about 13% (33% vs 46%). INTERPRETATION: The existence of similar relapse 
      trajectories on active medication and on placebo suggests that there is no specific 
      relapse signature associated with antidepressant discontinuation. Furthermore, 
      continued treatment offers only modest protection against relapse. These data 
      highlight the need to incorporate treatment strategies that prevent relapse as part 
      of the treatment of depression. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health, the US

TI  - Continuous control of tracheal cuff pressure for VAP prevention: a collaborative 
      meta-analysis of individual participant data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Underinflation of tracheal cuff is a risk factor for microaspiration of 
      contaminated secretions and subsequent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The 
      aim of this collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data is to 
      determine the impact of continuous control of P cuff on the incidence of VAP. 
      METHODS: Studies were identified by searching PubMed and references of relevant 
      articles. Data from 3 prospective controlled trials (two randomized and one 
      quasi-randomized), which evaluated the impact of continuous control of P cuff on the 
      incidence of VAP, were obtained and pooled together. Three different devices were 
      used to continuously control P cuff. VAP was diagnosed using clinical, radiologic, 
      and quantitative microbiological criteria. The impact of continuous control of P 
      cuff on VAP was assessed by Cox regression analysis, stratified on trial. RESULTS: 
      263 (48.4 %) patients received continuous control of P cuff, and 280 (51.5 %) 
      patients received routine control of P cuff using a manometer. 36 (13.6 %) VAP were 
      diagnosed in continuous control group, and 72 (25.7 %) in routine care group (HR 
      0.47, 95 % CI 0.31-0.71, p < 0.001). However, heterogeneity was apparent in 
      continuous control effect size across trials (I (2) = 58 %, p = 0.085). The number 
      of patients needed to treat to prevent one VAP episode was 8. No significant impact 
      of continuous control of P cuff was found on duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU 
      length of stay, or mortality. CONCLUSION: Continuous control of P cuff might be 
      beneficial in reducing the risk for VAP. However, no significant impact of 
      continuous control of P cuff was found on duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU 
      length of stay, or mortality.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize clinical evidence for intraoperative ventilation 
      settings, which could protect against postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) 
      in surgical patients with uninjured lungs. RECENT FINDINGS: There is convincing 
      evidence for protection against PPCs by low tidal volumes: benefit was found in 
      several randomized controlled trials, and was recently confirmed in meta-analyses. 
      Evidence for protection against PPCs by high levels of positive end-expiratory 
      pressure (PEEP) is less definite. Although benefit was found in several randomized 
      controlled trials, most of them compared a bundle of low tidal volume and high level 
      of PEEP with conventional ventilation; one recent large randomized controlled trial 
      that compared high with low levels of PEEP showed that ventilation with high level 
      of PEEP did not protect against PPCs but caused intraoperative complications 
      instead. A recent individual patient data meta-analysis of trials comparing bundles 
      of low tidal volume and high levels of PEEP to conventional intraoperative 
      ventilation suggested that protection against PPCs comes from tidal volume 
      reductions, and not from increasing levels of PEEP. SUMMARY: The understanding on 
      the protective roles of tidal volume and PEEP settings against PPCs has rapidly 
      expanded. During intraoperative ventilation, low tidal volumes are protective, the 
      protective role of high levels of PEEP is uncertain.

TI  - Meta-analysis supporting noninferiority of oxaliplatin plus S-1 to cisplatin plus 
      S-1 in first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer (G-SOX study): indirect 
      comparison with S-1 alone.
PG  - 668-675
LID - 10.1007/s10147-015-0938-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Randomized Phase III Study Comparing Oxaliplatin plus S-1 with 
      Cisplatin plus S-1 in Chemotherapy-naïve Patients with Advanced Gastric Cancer 
      (G-SOX) showed the noninferiority of S-1 (an oral fluoropyrimidine-derivative 
      dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase inhibitor) plus oxaliplatin combination therapy 
      (SOX) to S-1 plus cisplatin therapy (CS) in overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) from 
      proportional hazard model 0.958, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.803-1.142; 
      noninferiority margin 1.15]. To further clarify the clinical position of SOX in 
      advanced gastric cancer (AGC), a meta-analysis including information from other 
      reported studies was conducted. METHODS: In addition to G-SOX, Japanese phase III 
      clinical trials including S-1 monotherapy were included in the analyses. Individual 
      patient data for SOX (318 patients) and CS (324 patients) from G-SOX, as well as 
      those for S-1 (160 patients) from the Randomized Phase III Study Comparing the 
      Efficacy and Safety of Irinotecan plus S-1 with S-1 Alone as First-line Treatment 
      for Advanced Gastric Cancer (GC0301/TOP-002), were available. Published clinical 
      information for S-1 from other studies (total 705 patients) was also collected. A 
      Weibull distribution was assumed for overall survival time, and parameters for SOX, 
      CS, and S-1 were estimated parametrically. Posterior HR distributions were obtained 
      with a Bayesian approach. RESULTS: The HR of SOX to S-1 was 0.817 (95 % credible 
      interval 0.704-0.939), and the probability of the HR <1.00 was 99.8 %. The HR of CS 
      to S-1 was 0.871 (95 % credible interval; 0.754-0.998), and the probability of the 
      HR <1.00 was 97.6 %. The HR of SOX to CS in G-SOX was 0.942 (95 % credible interval; 
      0.789-1.117), and the probability of HR <1.15 was 98.9 %. CONCLUSION: This 
      meta-analysis indicates that SOX was superior to S-1 and noninferior to CS in AGC.

TI  - Improved Dietary Guidelines for Vitamin D: Application of Individual Participant 
      Data (IPD)-Level Meta-Regression Analyses.
LID - 10.3390/nu9050469 [doi]
LID - 469
AB  - Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for vitamin D have a key role in the prevention of 
      vitamin D deficiency. However, despite adopting similar risk assessment protocols, 
      estimates from authoritative agencies over the last 6 years have been diverse. This 
      may have arisen from diverse approaches to data analysis. Modelling strategies for 
      pooling of individual subject data from cognate vitamin D randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) are likely to provide the most appropriate DRV estimates. Thus, the 
      objective of the present work was to undertake the first-ever individual participant 
      data (IPD)-level meta-regression, which is increasingly recognized as best practice, 
      from seven winter-based RCTs (with 882 participants ranging in age from 4 to 90 
      years) of the vitamin D intake-serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) dose-response. 
      Our IPD-derived estimates of vitamin D intakes required to maintain 97.5% of 25(OH)D 
      concentrations >25, 30, and 50 nmol/L across the population are 10, 13, and 26 
      µg/day, respectively. In contrast, standard meta-regression analyses with aggregate 
      data (as used by several agencies in recent years) from the same RCTs estimated that 
      a vitamin D intake requirement of 14 µg/day would maintain 97.5% of 25(OH)D >50 
      nmol/L. These first IPD-derived estimates offer improved dietary recommendations for 
      vitamin D because the underpinning modeling captures the between-person variability 
      in response of serum 25(OH)D to vitamin D intake.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The beneficial effect of dietary omega-3 supplementation in younger 
      adults or older people with acute or chronic disease is established. Knowledge is 
      now needed about the effect in medically stable older people. The objective of this 
      study is to examine and assess the evidence for a role of dietary omega-3 
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation in older adults on (1) muscle mass 
      and muscle strength, (2) inflammatory biomarkers and (3) physical activity. METHODS 
      AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review and data synthesis will be conducted of randomised 
      controlled trials in older people not recruited for any given disease diagnosis. 
      Placebo-controlled studies reporting interventions involving dietary supplementation 
      of omega-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid will be included. 
      Outcomes must include changes from baseline to last available follow-up for one or 
      more of the following: muscle mass, inflammatory biomarkers, physical activity, 
      walking speed, weight change, hand grip strength or muscle strength. Once the search 
      strategy has been carried out, two independent researchers will assess relevant 
      papers for eligibility. Articles up until 31 December 2017 in any language will be 
      included. We will provide a narrative synthesis of the findings from the included 
      studies. Studies will be grouped for meta-analysis according to the outcome(s) 
      provided. Where studies have used the same type of intervention, with the same 
      outcome measure, we will pool the results using a random effects meta-analysis, with 
      standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for binary 
      outcomes, and calculate 95% CI and two-sided p values for each outcome. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: No research ethics approval is required for this systematic review as 
      no confidential patient data will be used. The results of this systematic review 
      will be disseminated through publication in an open-access peer-reviewed journal and 
      through conference presentations. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017080240.

TI  - Which heart failure patients profit from natriuretic peptide guided therapy? A 
      meta-analysis from individual patient data of randomized trials.
PG  - 1252-61
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.401 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Previous analyses suggest that heart failure (HF) therapy guided by 
      (N-terminal pro-)brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) might be dependent on left 
      ventricular ejection fraction, age and co-morbidities, but the reasons remain 
      unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine interactions between (NT-pro)BNP-guided 
      therapy and HF with reduced [ejection fraction (EF) ≤45%; HF with reduced EF 
      (HFrEF), n = 1731] vs. preserved EF [EF > 45%; HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), n = 
      301] and co-morbidities (hypertension, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular insult, peripheral vascular disease) on outcome, 
      individual patient data (n = 2137) from eight NT-proBNP guidance trials were 
      analysed using Cox-regression with multiplicative interaction terms. Endpoints were 
      mortality and admission because of HF. Whereas in HFrEF patients (NT-pro)BNP-guided 
      compared with symptom-guided therapy resulted in lower mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 
      = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.97, P = 0.03] and fewer HF admissions 
      (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.97, P = 0.02), no such effect was seen in HFpEF 
      (mortality: HR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.76-1.96, P = 0.41; HF admissions HR = 1.01, 95% CI 
      0.67-1.53, P = 0.97; interactions P < 0.02). Age (74 ± 11 years) interacted with 
      treatment strategy allocation independently of EF regarding mortality (P = 0.02), 
      but not HF admission (P = 0.54). The interaction of age and mortality was explained 
      by the interaction of treatment strategy allocation with co-morbidities. In HFpEF, 
      renal failure provided strongest interaction (P < 0.01; increased risk of 
      (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy if renal failure present), whereas in HFrEF patients, the 
      presence of at least two of the following co-morbidities provided strongest 
      interaction (P < 0.01; (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy beneficial only if none or one of 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular insult, or 
      peripheral vascular disease present). (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy was harmful in 
      HFpEF patients without hypertension (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The benefits of therapy 
      guided by (NT-pro)BNP were present in HFrEF only. Co-morbidities seem to influence 
      the response to (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy and may explain the lower efficacy of 
      this approach in elderly patients.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation: effects by subgroup defined by genetically 
      informed biomarkers.
PG  - CD011823
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD011823.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD011823
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation therapies are not effective for all smokers, and 
      researchers are interested in identifying those subgroups of individuals (e.g. based 
      on genotype) who respond best to specific treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether 
      quit rates vary by genetically informed biomarkers within pharmacotherapy treatment 
      arms and as compared with placebo. To assess the effects of pharmacotherapies for 
      smoking cessation in subgroups of smokers defined by genotype for identified 
      genome-wide significant polymorphisms. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane 
      Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register, clinical trial registries, and 
      genetics databases for trials of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation from 
      inception until 16 August 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised 
      controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited adult smokers and reported pharmacogenomic 
      analyses from trials of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies versus controls. 
      Eligible trials included those with data on a priori genome-wide significant (P < 5 
      × 10(-8)) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), replicated non-SNPs, and/or the 
      nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), hereafter collectively described as biomarkers. 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by 
      Cochrane. The primary outcome was smoking abstinence at six months after treatment. 
      The secondary outcome was abstinence at end of treatment (EOT). We conducted two 
      types of meta-analyses- one in which we assessed smoking cessation of active 
      treatment versus placebo within genotype groups, and another in which we compared 
      smoking cessation across genotype groups within treatment arms. We carried out 
      analyses separately in non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) and non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs). We 
      assessed heterogeneity between genotype groups using T², I², and Cochrane Q 
      statistics. MAIN RESULTS: Analyses included 18 trials including 9017 participants, 
      of whom 6924 were NHW and 2093 NHB participants. Data were available for the 
      following biomarkers: nine SNPs (rs1051730 (CHRNA3); rs16969968, rs588765, and 
      rs2036527 (CHRNA5); rs3733829 and rs7937 (in EGLN2, near CYP2A6); rs1329650 and 
      rs1028936 (LOC100188947); and rs215605 (PDE1C)), two variable number tandem repeats 
      (VNTRs; DRD4 and SLC6A4), and the NMR. Included data produced a total of 40 active 
      versus placebo comparisons, 16 active versus active comparisons, and 64 
      between-genotype comparisons within treatment arms.For those meta-analyses showing 
      statistically significant heterogeneity between genotype groups, we found the 
      quality of evidence (GRADE) to be generally moderate. We downgraded quality most 
      often because of imprecision or risk of bias due to potential selection bias in 
      genotyping trial participants. Comparisons of relative treatment effects by 
      genotypeFor six-month abstinence, we found statistically significant heterogeneity 
      between genotypes (rs16969968) for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo 
      at six months for NHB participants (P = 0.03; n = 2 trials), but not for other 
      biomarkers or treatment comparisons. Six-month abstinence was increased in the 
      active NRT group as compared to placebo among participants with a GG genotype (risk 
      ratio (RR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.03), but not in the combined 
      group of participants with a GA or AA genotype (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.26; ratio 
      of risk ratios (RRR) GG vs GA or AA of 3.51, 95% CI 1.19 to 10.3). Comparisons of 
      treatment effects between genotype groups within pharmacotherapy randomisation 
      armsFor those receiving active NRT, treatment was more effective in achieving 
      six-month abstinence among individuals with a slow NMR than among those with a 
      normal NMR among NHW and NHB combined participants (normal NMR vs slow NMR: RR 0.54, 
      95% CI 0.37 to 0.78; n = 2 trials). We found no such differences in treatment 
      effects between genotypes at six months for any of the other biomarkers among 
      individuals who received pharmacotherapy or placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We did 
      not identify widespread differential treatment effects of pharmacotherapy based on 
      genotype. Some genotype groups within certain ethnic groups may benefit more from 
      NRT or may benefit less from the combination of bupropion with NRT. The reader 
      should interpret these results with caution because none of the statistically 
      significant meta-analyses included more than two trials per genotype comparison, 
      many confidence intervals were wide, and the quality of this evidence (GRADE) was 
      generally moderate. Although we found evidence of superior NRT efficacy for NMR slow 
      versus normal metabolisers, because of the lack of heterogeneity between NMR groups, 
      we cannot conclude that NRT is more effective for slow metabolisers. Access to 
      additional data from multiple trials is needed, particularly for comparisons of 
      different pharmacotherapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis is considered the "gold 
      standard" for exploring the effectiveness of interventions in different subgroups of 
      patients. However, obtaining IPD is time-consuming and contact with the researchers 
      responsible for the original trials is usually required. To date, there are no 
      studies evaluating different strategies to optimize the process for retrieval of IPD 
      from such researchers. Our aim is to examine the impact of providing incentives to 
      the researchers responsible for the trials eligible for a meta-analysis to submit 
      their IPD. METHODS/DESIGN: We updated our previously published systematic reviews 
      for type 1 diabetes mellitus comparing long- and intermediate-acting insulin 
      regimens (from January 2013 to June 2015) and for Alzheimer's dementia comparing 
      cognitive enhancers (from January 2015 to May 2015). Eligible were randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) fulfilling the eligibility criteria of the systematic 
      reviews. We will randomly allocate authors of the reports of these RCTs into an 
      intervention or control group. Those allocated to the intervention group will be 
      contacted by email, mail, and phone, and will be asked to provide the IPD from their 
      RCT and will be given a financial incentive. Those allocated to the control group 
      will be contacted by email, mail, and phone, but will not receive a financial 
      incentive. Our primary outcome will be the proportion of authors who provide the 
      IPD. The secondary outcomes will be the time to return the dataset (defined as the 
      period between the information request and the authors' response with the dataset), 
      and completeness of data. We will compare the response rates in the two groups using 
      the odds ratio and the corresponding 95 % confidence interval. We will also use 
      binary logistic regression and cox regression analyses to examine whether different 
      RCT characteristics, such as study size and sponsor information, influence the 
      probability of providing IPD and the time needed to share the data. DISCUSSION: This 
      study will determine whether a financial incentive affects response rates when 
      seeking IPD from the original researchers. We will disseminate our findings in an 
      open access scientific journal and present results at national and international 
      conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered in Clinical Trials.gov, ID 
      number NCT02569411 . Date of registration 5 October 2015.

TI  - A validated severity score for haemorrhoids as an essential prerequisite for future 
      haemorrhoid trials.

LID - 10.1007/s10151-019-01936-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of standardised outcomes for haemorrhoidal disease 
      making comparison between trials difficult. A need for a very well validated 
      severity score is essential to facilitate meta-analysis of comparative studies, 
      enabling evidence-based clinical practice. METHODS: The Hubble trial provides a 
      large cohort of patients with haemorrhoidal disease randomised to rubber band 
      ligation (RBL) or haemorrhoidal artery ligation. The haemorrhoid severity score 
      (HSS) was collected on each patient at baseline, 6 weeks and 1 year after 
      intervention. This allows for the responsiveness of the HSS instrument to be 
      examined and compared with a more specific instrument, the Vaizey incontinence score 
      (also collected). Responsiveness was tested using four methods (effect size, 
      standardised response means (SRM), significance of change, and responsiveness 
      statistic). RESULTS: The four tests of responsiveness demonstrated that the HSS was 
      more responsive to changes in the patient's health status following both of the 
      interventions compared to the Vaizey questionnaire. For example, between baseline 
      and 6 weeks, the RBL intervention effect size scores and SRM calculations indicated 
      a non-significant small amount of change (0.20 and 0.16 respectively). However, 
      using the HSS, the effect size and SRM demonstrated a large magnitude of change 
      (1.12 and 1.01, respectively) which was significant. Similar results were observed 
      at 1 year. Significance of change scores and the index of responsiveness were also 
      higher for the HSS questionnaire than the Vaizey across both treatment modalities. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The HSS is a highly responsive tool for the detection of changes in 
      haemorrhoid symptoms. It should form an essential patient-reported outcome tool for 
      future studies on haemorrhoidal disease.

TI  - Testing moderation in network meta-analysis with individual participant data.
PG  - 2485-502
LID - 10.1002/sim.6883 [doi]
AB  - Meta-analytic methods for combining data from multiple intervention trials are 
      commonly used to estimate the effectiveness of an intervention. They can also be 
      extended to study comparative effectiveness, testing which of several alternative 
      interventions is expected to have the strongest effect. This often requires network 
      meta-analysis (NMA), which combines trials involving direct comparison of two 
      interventions within the same trial and indirect comparisons across trials. In this 
      paper, we extend existing network methods for main effects to examining moderator 
      effects, allowing for tests of whether intervention effects vary for different 
      populations or when employed in different contexts. In addition, we study how the 
      use of individual participant data may increase the sensitivity of NMA for detecting 
      moderator effects, as compared with aggregate data NMA that employs study-level 
      effect sizes in a meta-regression framework. A new NMA diagram is proposed. We also 
      develop a generalized multilevel model for NMA that takes into account within-trial 
      and between-trial heterogeneity and can include participant-level covariates. Within 
      this framework, we present definitions of homogeneity and consistency across trials. 
      A simulation study based on this model is used to assess effects on power to detect 
      both main and moderator effects. Results show that power to detect moderation is 
      substantially greater when applied to individual participant data as compared with 
      study-level effects. We illustrate the use of this method by applying it to data 
      from a classroom-based randomized study that involved two sub-trials, each comparing 
      interventions that were contrasted with separate control groups. Copyright © 2016

TI  - One-stage individual participant data meta-analysis models: estimation of 
      treatment-covariate interactions must avoid ecological bias by separating out 
      within-trial and across-trial information.
PG  - 772-789
LID - 10.1002/sim.7171 [doi]
AB  - Stratified medicine utilizes individual-level covariates that are associated with a 
      differential treatment effect, also known as treatment-covariate interactions. When 
      multiple trials are available, meta-analysis is used to help detect true 
      treatment-covariate interactions by combining their data. Meta-regression of 
      trial-level information is prone to low power and ecological bias, and therefore, 
      individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses are preferable to examine 
      interactions utilizing individual-level information. However, one-stage IPD models 
      are often wrongly specified, such that interactions are based on amalgamating 
      within- and across-trial information. We compare, through simulations and an applied 
      example, fixed-effect and random-effects models for a one-stage IPD meta-analysis of 
      time-to-event data where the goal is to estimate a treatment-covariate interaction. 
      We show that it is crucial to centre patient-level covariates by their mean value in 
      each trial, in order to separate out within-trial and across-trial information. 
      Otherwise, bias and coverage of interaction estimates may be adversely affected, 
      leading to potentially erroneous conclusions driven by ecological bias. We revisit 
      an IPD meta-analysis of five epilepsy trials and examine age as a treatment effect 
      modifier. The interaction is -0.011 (95% CI: -0.019 to -0.003; p = 0.004), and thus 
      highly significant, when amalgamating within-trial and across-trial information. 
      However, when separating within-trial from across-trial information, the interaction 
      is -0.007 (95% CI: -0.019 to 0.005; p = 0.22), and thus its magnitude and 
      statistical significance are greatly reduced. We recommend that meta-analysts should 
      only use within-trial information to examine individual predictors of treatment 
      effect and that one-stage IPD models should separate within-trial from across-trial 
      information to avoid ecological bias. © 2016 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine

TI  - surrosurv: An R package for the evaluation of failure time surrogate endpoints in 
      individual patient data meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Surrogate endpoints are attractive for use in clinical 
      trials instead of well-established endpoints because of practical convenience. To 
      validate a surrogate endpoint, two important measures can be estimated in a 
      meta-analytic context when individual patient data are available: the R(indiv)(2) or 
      the Kendall's τ at the individual level, and the R(trial)(2) at the trial level. We 
      aimed at providing an R implementation of classical and well-established as well as 
      more recent statistical methods for surrogacy assessment with failure time 
      endpoints. We also intended incorporating utilities for model checking and 
      visualization and data generating methods described in the literature to date. 
      METHODS: In the case of failure time endpoints, the classical approach is based on 
      two steps. First, a Kendall's τ is estimated as measure of individual level 
      surrogacy using a copula model. Then, the R(trial)(2) is computed via a linear 
      regression of the estimated treatment effects; at this second step, the estimation 
      uncertainty can be accounted for via measurement-error model or via weights. In 
      addition to the classical approach, we recently developed an approach based on 
      bivariate auxiliary Poisson models with individual random effects to measure the 
      Kendall's τ and treatment-by-trial interactions to measure the R(trial)(2). The most 
      common data simulation models described in the literature are based on: copula 
      models, mixed proportional hazard models, and mixture of half-normal and exponential 
      random variables. RESULTS: The R package surrosurv implements the classical two-step 
      method with Clayton, Plackett, and Hougaard copulas. It also allows to optionally 
      adjusting the second-step linear regression for measurement-error. The mixed Poisson 
      approach is implemented with different reduced models in addition to the full model. 
      We present the package functions for estimating the surrogacy models, for checking 
      their convergence, for performing leave-one-trial-out cross-validation, and for 
      plotting the results. We illustrate their use in practice on individual patient data 
      from a meta-analysis of 4069 patients with advanced gastric cancer from 20 trials of 
      chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The surrosurv package provides an R implementation of 
      classical and recent statistical methods for surrogacy assessment of failure time 
      endpoints. Flexible simulation functions are available to generate data according to 
      the methods described in the literature.

AB  - Numerous studies have investigated use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for prevention 
      of cardiovascular deaths. The vast majority of the work in this area has focused on 
      secondary prevention. However, underuse of ASA still remains a major issue. Fewer 
      studies have investigated the impact of ASA on primary prevention of cardiovascular 
      death. A meta-analysis of individual participant data from six randomized studies, 
      published in 2009, showed decrease in serious vascular events but at the cost of 
      causing increased bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. Recent studies have raised a 
      number of key questions regarding the benefits and risks of using ASA for primary 
      prevention.

TI  - Individual patient data meta-analysis of combined treatments versus psychotherapy 
      (with or without pill placebo), pharmacotherapy or pill placebo for adult 
      depression: a protocol.
PG  - e013478
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013478 [doi]
LID - e013478
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are many proven treatments (psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy or 
      their combination) for the treatment of depression. Although there is growing 
      evidence for the effectiveness of combination treatment (psychotherapy + 
      pharmacotherapy) over pharmacotherapy alone, psychotherapy alone or psychotherapy 
      plus pill placebo, for depression, little is known about which specific groups of 
      patients may respond best to combined treatment versus monotherapy. Conventional 
      meta-analyses techniques have limitations when tasked with examining whether 
      specific individual characteristics moderate the effect of treatment on depression. 
      Therefore, this protocol outlines an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to 
      explore which patients, with which clinical characteristics, have better outcomes in 
      combined treatment compared with psychotherapy (alone or with pill placebo), 
      pharmacotherapy and pill placebo. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Study searches are completed 
      using an established database of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the 
      psychological treatment of adult depression that has previously been reported. 
      Searches were conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase and the Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials. RCTs comparing combination treatment (psychotherapy + 
      pharmacotherapy) with psychotherapy (with or without pill placebo), pharmacotherapy 
      or pill placebo for the treatment of adult depression will be included. Study 
      authors of eligible trials will be contacted and asked to contribute IPD. 
      Conventional meta-analysis techniques will be used to examine differences between 
      studies that have contributed data and those that did not. Then, IPD will be 
      harmonised and analysis using multilevel regression will be conducted to examine 
      effect moderators of treatment outcomes. DISSEMINATION: Study results outlined above 
      will be published in peer-reviewed journals. Study results will contribute to better 
      understanding whether certain patients respond best to combined treatment or other 
      depression treatments and provide new information on moderators of treatment outcome 
      that can be used by patients, clinicians and researchers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      CRD42016039028.

TI  - 2-year outcomes with the Absorb bioresorbable scaffold for treatment of coronary 
      artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven randomised trials 
      with an individual patient data substudy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) offer the potential to improve 
      long-term outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention after their complete 
      bioresorption. Randomised trials have shown non-inferiority between BVS and metallic 
      drug-eluting stents at 1 year in composite safety and effectiveness outcomes, 
      although some increases in rates of target vessel-related myocardial infarction and 
      device thrombosis were identified. Outcomes of BVS following the first year after 
      implantation are unknown. We sought to ascertain whether BVS are as safe and 
      effective as drug-eluting stents within 2 years after implantation and between 1 and 
      2 years. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials 
      in which patients were randomly assigned to everolimus-eluting Absorb BVS or 
      metallic everolimus-eluting stents (EES) and followed up for at least 2 years. We 
      searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, TCTMD, ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical Trial 
      Results, CardioSource, and abstracts and presentations from major cardiovascular 
      meetings up to April 1, 2017, to identify relevant studies. The primary efficacy 
      outcome measure was the device-oriented composite endpoint (cardiac mortality, 
      target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or ischaemia-driven target lesion 
      revascularisation) and the primary safety outcome measure was definite or probable 
      device thrombosis. Individual patient data from the four ABSORB trials were used for 
      landmark and subgroup analysis and multivariable modelling. FINDINGS: We identified 
      seven randomised trials in which 5583 patients were randomly assigned to Absorb BVS 
      (n=3261) or metallic EES (n=2322) and followed up for 2 years. BVS had higher 2-year 
      relative risks of the device-oriented composite endpoint than did EES (9·4% [304 of 
      3217] vs 7·4% [169 of 2299]; relative risk [RR] 1·29 [95% CI 1·08-1·56], p=0·0059). 
      These differences were driven by increased rates of target vessel-related myocardial 
      infarction (5·8% [187 of 3218] vs 3·2% [74 of 2299]; RR 1·68 [95% CI 1·29-2·19], 
      p=0·0003) and ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation (5·3% [169 of 3217] 
      vs 3·9% [90 of 2300]; 1·40 [1·09-1·80], p=0·0090) with BVS, with non-significant 
      differences in cardiac mortality. The cumulative 2-year incidence of device 
      thrombosis was higher with BVS than with EES (2·3% [73 of 3187] vs 0·7% [16 of 
      2281]; RR 3·35 [95% CI 1·96-5·72], p<0·0001). Landmark analysis between 1 and 2 
      years also showed higher rates of the device-oriented composite endpoint (3·3% [69 
      of 2100] vs 1·9% [23 of 1193]; RR 1·64 [95% CI 1·03-2·61], p=0·0376) and device 
      thrombosis (0·5% [11 of 2085] vs none [0 of 1183], p<0·0001) in BVS-treated patients 
      than in EES-treated patients. INTERPRETATION: BVS was associated with increased 
      rates of composite device-oriented adverse events and device thrombosis cumulatively 
      at 2 years and between 1 and 2 years of follow-up compared with EES. FUNDING: Abbott 
      Vascular.

TI  - Protective versus Conventional Ventilation for Surgery: A Systematic Review and 
      Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis.
PG  - 66-78
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000000706 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies show that intraoperative mechanical ventilation using low 
      tidal volumes (VT) can prevent postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). The aim 
      of this individual patient data meta-analysis is to evaluate the individual 
      associations between VT size and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level and 
      occurrence of PPC. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing protective 
      ventilation (low VT with or without high levels of PEEP) and conventional 
      ventilation (high VT with low PEEP) in patients undergoing general surgery. The 
      primary outcome was development of PPC. Predefined prognostic factors were tested 
      using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Fifteen randomized controlled 
      trials were included (2,127 patients). There were 97 cases of PPC in 1,118 patients 
      (8.7%) assigned to protective ventilation and 148 cases in 1,009 patients (14.7%) 
      assigned to conventional ventilation (adjusted relative risk, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 to 
      0.88; P < 0.01). There were 85 cases of PPC in 957 patients (8.9%) assigned to 
      ventilation with low VT and high PEEP levels and 63 cases in 525 patients (12%) 
      assigned to ventilation with low VT and low PEEP levels (adjusted relative risk, 
      0.93; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.37; P = 0.72). A dose-response relationship was found 
      between the appearance of PPC and VT size (R2 = 0.39) but not between the appearance 
      of PPC and PEEP level (R2 = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: These data support the beneficial 
      effects of ventilation with use of low VT in patients undergoing surgery. Further 
      trials are necessary to define the role of intraoperative higher PEEP to prevent PPC 
      during nonopen abdominal surgery.

TI  - Propensity Score-Based Approaches to Confounding by Indication in Individual Patient 
      Data Meta-Analysis: Non-Standardized Treatment for Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the absence of randomized clinical trials, meta-analysis of 
      individual patient data (IPD) from observational studies may provide the most 
      accurate effect estimates for an intervention. However, confounding by indication 
      remains an important concern that can be addressed by incorporating individual 
      patient covariates in different ways. We compared different analytic approaches to 
      account for confounding in IPD from patients treated for multi-drug resistant 
      tuberculosis (MDR-TB). METHODS: Two antibiotic classes were evaluated, 
      fluoroquinolones--considered the cornerstone of effective MDR-TB treatment--and 
      macrolides, which are known to be safe, yet are ineffective in vitro. The primary 
      outcome was treatment success against treatment failure, relapse or death. Effect 
      estimates were obtained using multivariable and propensity-score based approaches. 
      RESULTS: Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were used in 28 included studies, within which 
      6,612 patients received a fluoroquinolone and 723 patients did not. Macrolides were 
      used in 15 included studies, within which 459 patients received this class of 
      antibiotics and 3,670 did not. Both standard multivariable regression and propensity 
      score-based methods resulted in similar effect estimates for early and late 
      generation fluoroquinolones, while macrolide antibiotics use was associated with 
      reduced treatment success. CONCLUSIONS: In this individual patient data 
      meta-analysis, standard multivariable and propensity-score based methods of 
      adjusting for individual patient covariates for observational studies yielded 
      produced similar effect estimates. Even when adjustment is made for potential 
      confounding, interpretation of adjusted estimates must still consider the potential 
      for residual bias.

TI  - Text2PreventCVD: protocol for a systematic review and individual participant data 
      meta-analysis of text message-based interventions for the prevention of 
      cardiovascular diseases.
PG  - e012723
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012723 [doi]
LID - e012723
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Text message interventions have been shown to be effective in 
      prevention and management of several non-communicable disease risk factors. However, 
      the extent to which their effects might vary in different participants and settings 
      is uncertain. We aim to conduct a systematic review and individual participant data 
      (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials examining text message 
      interventions aimed to prevent cardiovascular diseases (CVD) through modification of 
      cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Systematic review and IPD 
      meta-analysis will be conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic review and Meta-Analysis of IPD (PRISMA-IPD) guidelines. Electronic 
      database of published studies (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library) and 
      international trial registries will be searched to identify relevant randomised 
      clinical trials. Authors of studies meeting the inclusion criteria will be invited 
      to join the IPD meta-analysis group and contribute study data to the common 
      database. The primary outcome will be the difference between intervention and 
      control groups in blood pressure at 6-month follow-up. Key secondary outcomes 
      include effects on lipid parameters, body mass index, smoking levels and 
      self-reported quality of life. If sufficient data is available, we will also analyse 
      blood pressure and other secondary outcomes at 12 months. IPD meta-analysis will be 
      performed using a one-step approach and modelling data simultaneously while 
      accounting for the clustering of the participants within studies. This study will 
      use the existing data to assess the effectiveness of text message-based 
      interventions on CVRFs, the consistency of any effects by participant subgroups and 
      across different healthcare settings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was 
      obtained for the individual studies by the trial investigators from relevant local 
      ethics committees. This study will include anonymised data for secondary analysis 
      and investigators will be asked to check that this is consistent with their existing 
      approvals. Results will be disseminated via scientific forums including 
      peer-reviewed publications and presentations at international conferences. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42016033236.

TI  - Surrogate End Points for Overall Survival in Loco-Regionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal 
      Carcinoma: An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis.
LID - djw239 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our objective was to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and 
      distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) as surrogate end points for overall survival 
      (OS) in randomized trials of chemotherapy in loco-regionally advanced nasopharyngeal 
      carcinomas (NPCs). METHODS: Individual patient data were obtained from 19 trials of 
      the updated Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (MAC-NPC) plus 
      one additional trial (total = 5144 patients). Surrogacy was evaluated at the 
      individual level using a rank correlation coefficient ρ and at the trial level using 
      a correlation coefficient R(2) between treatment effects on the surrogate end point 
      and OS. A sensitivity analysis was performed with two-year PFS/DMFS and five-year 
      OS. RESULTS: PFS was strongly correlated with OS at the individual level (ρ = 0.93, 
      95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.93 to 0.94) and at the trial level (R(2) = 0.95, 
      95% CI = 0.47 to 1.00). For DMFS, too, the individual-level correlation with OS was 
      strong (ρ = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.98 to 0.98); at trial level, the correlation was high 
      but the regression adjusted for measurement error could not be computed (unadjusted 
      R(2) = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.94 to 0.99). In the sensitivity analysis, two-year PFS was 
      highly correlated with five-year OS at the individual level (ρ = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.88 
      to 0.90) and at the trial level (R(2) = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.46 to 1.00); two-year DMFS 
      was highly correlated with five-year OS at the individual level (ρ = 0.95, 95% 
      CI = 0.94 to 0.95) and at the trial level (R(2) = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.33 to 1.00). 
      CONCLUSIONS: PFS and DMFS are valid surrogate end points for OS to assess treatment 
      effect of chemotherapy in loco-regionally advanced NPC, while PFS can be measured 
      earlier.

TI  - Reporting of Sex Effects by Systematic Reviews on Interventions for Depression, 
      Diabetes, and Chronic Pain.
PG  - 184-93
LID - 10.7326/M15-2877 [doi]
AB  - Systematic reviews (SRs) have the potential to contribute uniquely to the evaluation 
      of sex and gender differences (termed "sex effects"). This article describes the 
      reporting of sex effects by SRs on interventions for depression, type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus, and chronic pain conditions (chronic low back pain, knee osteoarthritis, 
      and fibromyalgia). It includes SRs published since 1 October 2009 that evaluate 
      medications, behavioral interventions, exercise, quality improvement, and some 
      condition-specific treatments. The reporting of sex effects by primary randomized, 
      controlled trials is also examined. Of 313 eligible SRs (86 for depression, 159 for 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 68 for chronic pain), few (n = 29) reported sex 
      effects. Most SRs reporting sex effects used metaregression, whereas 9 SRs used 
      subgroup analysis or individual-patient data meta-analysis. The proportion of SRs 
      reporting the sex distribution of primary studies varied from a low of 31% (n = 8) 
      for low back pain to a high of 68% (n = 23) for fibromyalgia. Primary randomized, 
      controlled trials also infrequently reported sex effects, and most lacked an 
      adequate sample size to examine them. Therefore, all SRs should report the 
      proportion of women enrolled in primary studies and evaluate sex effects using 
      appropriate methods whenever power is adequate.

TI  - Network meta-analysis combining individual patient and aggregate data from a mixture 
      of study designs with an application to pulmonary arterial hypertension.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/s12874-015-0007-0 [doi]
LID - 34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a methodology for indirectly comparing, 
      and strengthening direct comparisons of two or more treatments for the management of 
      disease by combining evidence from multiple studies. It is sometimes not possible to 
      perform treatment comparisons as evidence networks restricted to randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) may be disconnected. We propose a Bayesian NMA model that 
      allows to include single-arm, before-and-after, observational studies to complete 
      these disconnected networks. We illustrate the method with an indirect comparison of 
      treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). METHODS: Our method uses a 
      random effects model for placebo improvements to include single-arm observational 
      studies into a general NMA. Building on recent research for binary outcomes, we 
      develop a covariate-adjusted continuous-outcome NMA model that combines individual 
      patient data (IPD) and aggregate data from two-arm RCTs with the single-arm 
      observational studies. We apply this model to a complex comparison of therapies for 
      PAH combining IPD from a phase-III RCT of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH and 
      aggregate data from RCTs and single-arm observational studies, both identified by a 
      systematic review. RESULTS: Through the inclusion of observational studies, our 
      method allowed the comparison of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH with other 
      treatments. This comparison had not been previously possible due to the limited RCT 
      evidence available. However, the credible intervals of our posterior estimates were 
      wide so the overall results were inconclusive. The comparison should be treated as 
      exploratory and should not be used to guide clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      method for the inclusion of single-arm observational studies allows the performance 
      of indirect comparisons that had previously not been possible due to incomplete 
      networks composed solely of available RCTs. We also built on many recent innovations 
      to enable researchers to use both aggregate data and IPD. This method could be used 
      in similar situations where treatment comparisons have not been possible due to 
      restrictions to RCT evidence and where a mixture of aggregate data and IPD are 
      available.

TI  - Individual patient data meta-analysis of antiplatelet regimens after 
      noncardioembolic stroke or TIA: rationale and design.
PG  - 145-50
LID - 10.1111/ijs.12581 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Cerebrovascular Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaborative Group was 
      formed to obtain and analyze individual patient data from the major randomized 
      trials of common antiplatelet regimens after cerebral ischemia. Although the risk of 
      stroke can be reduced by antiplatelet drugs, there continues to be uncertainty about 
      the balance of risk and benefits of different antiplatelet regimens for an 
      individual patient. AIMS: Our aim is to provide clinicians with a thorough 
      evidence-based answer on these therapeutic alternatives. METHODS: We have identified 
      six large randomized trials and plan to meta-analyze the data on an individual 
      patient level. In total, these trials have enrolled 46 948 patients with cerebral 
      ischemia. Uniquely, the Cerebrovascular Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaborative Group 
      has secured access to the individual data of all of these trials, with the 
      participation of key investigators and pharmaceutical companies. Our principal 
      objective includes deriving a reliable estimate of the efficacy of different 
      antiplatelet regimens on key outcomes including serious vascular events, major 
      ischemic events, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS: We propose to 
      redefine composite outcome events, if necessary, to achieve comparability. Further, 
      we aim to build and validate prognostic models for the risk of major bleeding and 
      intracranial hemorrhage and to build a decision model that may support 
      evidence-based decision making about which antiplatelet regimen would be most 
      effective in different risk groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This paper outlines 
      inclusion criteria, outcome measures, baseline characteristics, and planned 
      statistical analysis.

TI  - Systematic review of clinical trials assessing the therapeutic efficacy of visceral 
      leishmaniasis treatments: A first step to assess the feasibility of establishing an 
      individual patient data sharing platform.
PG  - e0005781
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005781 [doi]
LID - e0005781
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 cases of visceral 
      leishmaniasis (VL) annually. A variety of factors are taken into account when 
      considering the best therapeutic options to cure a patient and reduce the risk of 
      resistance, including geographical area, malnourishment and HIV coinfection. Pooled 
      analyses combine data from many studies to answer specific scientific questions that 
      cannot be answered with individual studies alone. However, the heterogeneity of 
      study design, data collection, and analysis often makes direct comparison difficult. 
      Individual Participant Data (IPD) files can be standardised and analysed, allowing 
      detailed analysis of this merged larger pool, but only a small fraction of 
      systematic reviews and meta-analyses currently employ pooled analysis of IPD. We 
      conducted a systematic literature review to identify published studies and studies 
      reported in clinical trial registries to assess the feasibility of developing a VL 
      data sharing platform to facilitate an IPD-based analysis of clinical trial data. 
      Studies conducted between 1983 to 2015 that reported treatment outcome were 
      eligible. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From the 2,271 documents screened, 145 published VL 
      clinical trials were identified, with data from 26,986 patients. Methodologies 
      varied for diagnosis and treatment outcomes, but overall the volume of data 
      potentially available on different drugs and dose regimens identified hundreds or 
      possibly thousands of patients per arm suitable for IPD pooled meta-analyses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A VL data sharing platform would provide an opportunity to maximise 
      scientific use of available data to enable assessment of treatment efficacy, 
      contribute to evidence-based clinical management and guide optimal prospective data 
      collection.

TI  - Does oral carbohydrate supplementation improve labour outcome? A systematic review 
      and individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 510-7
LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.13728 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Labour is a period of significant physical activity. The importance of 
      carbohydrate intake to improve outcome has been recognised in sports medicine and 
      general surgery. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of oral carbohydrate 
      supplementation on labour outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966-2014), Embase, 
      the Cochrane Library and clinical trial registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised 
      controlled trials (RCT) of women randomised to receive oral carbohydrate in labour 
      (<6 cm dilated), versus placebo or standard care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      Authors were contacted to provide data. Individual patient data meta-analyses were 
      performed to calculate pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
      MAIN RESULTS: Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Six authors responded, four 
      supplied data (n = 691). Three studies used isotonic drinks (one placebo-controlled, 
      two compared with standard care), and one an advice booklet regarding carbohydrate 
      intake. The mean difference in energy intake between the intervention and control 
      groups was small [three studies, 195 kilocalories (kcal), 95% CI 118-273]. There was 
      no difference in the risk of caesarean section (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.83- 1.61), 
      instrumental birth (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.96-1.66) or syntocinon augmentation (RR 0.99, 
      95% CI 0.86-1.13). Length of labour was similar (mean difference -3.15 minutes, 95% 
      CI -35.14 to 41.95). Restricting the analysis to primigravid women did not affect 
      the result. Oral carbohydrates did not increase the risk of vomiting (RR 1.09, 95% 
      CI 0.78-1.52) or 1-minute Apgar score <7 (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.82-1.83). AUTHORS' 
      CONCLUSION: Oral carbohydrate supplements in small quantities did not alter labour 
      outcome. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Oral carbohydrate does not affect labour. But the 
      difference between intervention and control equals 10 teaspoons sugar.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate how data from n-of-1 trials may be used in systematic 
      reviews and meta-analyses by examining the effects of amphetamine and 
      methylphenidate for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). STUDY DESIGN 
      AND SETTING: Electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO for English 
      language articles published from 1950 to 2013. N-of-1 trials of pediatric 
      participants with ADHD that assessed either amphetamine or methylphenidate vs. 
      placebo were included. The primary outcome was improvement of core symptoms of ADHD, 
      which was assessed by multiple rating scales. Studies with obtainable individual 
      participant data were included in the meta-analysis. Weighted mean differences were 
      computed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the 
      amphetamine-placebo comparison and 10 in the methylphenidate-placebo comparison. 
      Meta-analyses were consistently in favor of amphetamine in 10 of 11 ADHD symptom 
      domains and methylphenidate in 7 of 12 symptom domains. A high degree of 
      heterogeneity across participant treatment response was observed. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Meta-analysis of n-of-1 trials suggests that amphetamine and methylphenidate are 
      effective treatments for pediatric ADHD. Synthesizing n-of-1 trials enables 
      assessment of individual responses to treatment as well as aggregate summaries 
      across individuals and studies. It offers a promising general approach with 
      applications across diverse treatments and disorders.

TI  - Tenecteplase versus alteplase in stroke thrombolysis: An individual patient data 
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 534-43
LID - 10.1177/1747493016641112 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tenecteplase, a modified plasminogen activator with higher fibrin 
      specificity and longer half-life, may have advantages over alteplase in acute 
      ischemic stroke thrombolysis. AIMS: We undertook an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared alteplase with 
      tenecteplase in acute stroke. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified by a MEDLINE 
      search, and individual patient data were acquired. We compared clinical outcomes 
      including modified Rankin Scale at three months, early neurological improvement at 
      24 h, intracerebral hemorrhage, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and mortality 
      at three months between all dose tiers of tenecteplase and alteplase. RESULTS: Three 
      relevant studies (Haley et al., Parsons et al., and ATTEST) included 291 patients 
      and investigated three doses of tenecteplase (0.1, 0.25, 0.4 mg/kg). There were no 
      differences between any dose of tenecteplase and alteplase for either efficacy or 
      safety end points. Tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg had the greatest odds to achieve early 
      neurological improvement (OR [95%CI] 3.3 [1.5, 7.2], p = 0.093), excellent 
      functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-1) at three months (OR [95%CI] 1.9 [0.8, 
      4.4], p = 0.28), with reduced odds of intracerebral hemorrhage (OR [95%CI] 0.6 [0.2, 
      1.8], P = 0.43) compared with alteplase. Only 19 patients were treated with 
      tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg, which showed increased odds of symptomatic intracerebral 
      hemorrhage compared with alteplase (OR [95% CI] 6.2 [0.7, 56.3]). CONCLUSIONS: While 
      no significant differences between tenecteplase and alteplase were found, point 
      estimates suggest potentially greater efficacy of 0.25 and 0.1 mg/kg doses with no 
      difference in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and potentially higher 
      symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage risk with the 0.4 mg/kg dose. Further 
      investigation of 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase is warranted.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of drug-resistant 
      epilepsy: A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis of 
      real-world evidence.
PG  - 55-65
LID - 10.1002/epi4.12092 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world evidence 
      for the use of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in 
      the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: We systematically searched 
      PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and clinicaltrials.gov for all relevant articles. Relevant 
      patient and stimulation predictors as well as seizure outcomes were assessed. For 
      studies with and without individual participant data (IPD), the primary outcomes 
      were the rate of "favorable response" (reduction in seizure frequency ≥50%) and 
      pooled event rate of mean reduction in seizure frequency, respectively. Outcomes 
      were assessed with comparative statistics and random-effects meta-analysis models. 
      RESULTS: Of 3,477 identified articles, 12 met eligibility and were included in this 
      review. We were able to obtain IPD for 5 articles constituting 34 participants. 
      Univariate analysis on IPD identified greater favorable response event rates between 
      participants with temporal seizure focus versus extratemporal (50% vs. 14%, p = 
      0.045) and between participants who were stimulated with a figure-8 coil versus 
      other types (47% vs. 0%, p = 0.01). We also performed study-level meta-analysis on 
      the remaining 7 studies without IPD, which included 212 participants. The pooled 
      mean event rate of 50% seizure reduction using low-frequency rTMS was 30% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 12-57%). Sensitivity analysis revealed that studies with a 
      mean age ≤21 years and studies using targeted stimulation had the highest seizure 
      reduction rates compared to studies with a mean age >21 years (69% vs. 18%) and not 
      using a targeted stimulation (47% vs. 14-20%). Moreover, we identified high 
      interstudy heterogeneity, moderate study bias, and high publication bias. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Real-world evidence suggests that low-frequency rTMS using a figure-8 
      coil may be an effective therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in 
      pediatric patients. This meta-analysis can inform the design and expedite 
      recruitment of a subsequent randomized clinical trial.

TI  - Impact of Viral Status on Survival in Patients Receiving Sorafenib for Advanced 
      Hepatocellular Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Phase III Trials.
PG  - 622-628
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2016.69.5197 [doi]
AB  - Purpose Following the Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomized 
      Protocol (SHARP) trial, sorafenib has become the standard of care for patients with 
      advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, but the relation between survival 
      advantage and disease etiology remains unclear. To address this, we undertook an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis of three large prospective randomized trials 
      in which sorafenib was the control arm. Methods Of a total of 3,256 patients, 1,643 
      (50%) who received sorafenib were available. The primary end point was overall 
      survival (OS). A Bayesian hierarchical approach for individual patient data 
      meta-analyses was applied using a piecewise exponential model. Results are presented 
      in terms of hazard ratios comparing sorafenib with alternative therapies according 
      to hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) status. Results Hazard ratios 
      show improved OS for sorafenib in patients who are both HBV negative and HCV 
      positive (log [hazard ratio], -0.27; 95% CI, -0.46 to -0.06). Median unadjusted 
      survival is 12.6 (11.15 to 13.8) months for sorafenib and 10.2 (8.88 to 12.2) months 
      for "other" treatments in this subgroup. There was no evidence of improvement in OS 
      for any other patient subgroups defined by HBV and HCV. Results were consistent 
      across all trials with heterogeneity assessed using Cochran's Q statistic. 
      Conclusion There is consistent evidence that the effect of sorafenib on OS is 
      dependent on patients' hepatitis status. There is an improved OS for patients 
      negative for HBV and positive for HCV when treated with sorafenib. There was no 
      evidence of any improvement in OS attributable to sorafenib for patients positive 
      for HBV and negative for HCV.

TI  - pCR rates in patients with bilateral breast cancer after neoadjuvant 
      anthracycline-taxane based-chemotherapy - A retrospective pooled analysis of 
      individual patients data of four German neoadjuvant trials.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with bilateral breast cancer (BBC) are usually excluded from 
      participating in clinical trials and little is known about the response and outcome 
      of BBC to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to unilateral BC (UBC). METHODS: We 
      prospectively captured the information on patients with BBC in our database treated 
      within four neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials and collected retrospectively the rate 
      of pathological complete response (pCR) defined as ypT0 ypN0, ypT0/is ypN0, ypT0 
      ypNX, clinical and histologic parameters. Synchronous carcinoma in the contralateral 
      breast was considered as the non-indicator lesion. Patients with UBC only treated 
      within the same neoadjuvant trials performed the control group. RESULTS: From the 
      6727 patients treated within 4 German neoadjuvant trials 119 (1.8%) patients have 
      been identified with the diagnosis of BBC. The pCR rate (ypT0 ypN0) was 12.6% in the 
      non-indicator lesion group versus 10.9% the indicator lesion group versus 20.9% for 
      patients with unilateral disease (p = 0.003). There were more advanced tumor stages 
      and positive axillary lymph nodes in the indicator lesion than in the nonindicator 
      lesion or in UBC. In 52.5% the molecular subtype was identical between indicator and 
      non-indicator lesion with more triple negative and HER2 positive BC in the group of 
      UBC. The disease free survival rate (DFS) was 25.8% for patients with UBC versus 
      39.6% for patients with BBC. CONCLUSION: The selection for the indicator lesion was 
      based on tumor size, nodal status and inclusion criteria. Patients with BBC patients 
      had a lower pCR rate and a lower DFS.

TI  - VESPRO: An Individual Patient Data Prospective Meta-Analysis of Selective Internal 
      Radiation Therapy Versus Sorafenib for Advanced, Locally Advanced, or Recurrent 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma of the SARAH and SIRveNIB Trials.
PG  - e17
LID - 10.2196/resprot.7016 [doi]
LID - e17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an overall poor 
      prognosis. Currently there are 2 ongoing prospective randomized controlled trials 
      that are evaluating the efficacy and safety of sorafenib and selective internal 
      radiation therapy (SIRT) with yttrium-90 resin microspheres in patients with 
      advanced HCC. The SorAfenib versus Radioembolisation in Advanced Hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (SARAH; 459 patients) trial is being performed in Europe and the SIRt 
      VErsus SorafeNIB (SIRveNIB; 360 patients) trial in the Asia Pacific region. 
      Prospectively combining the results, these trials will not only allow for increased 
      precision to estimate efficacy (in terms of survival), but will also provide 
      increased statistical power for subgroup analyses. OBJECTIVE: To ensure the 
      prospectivity and transparency of the meta-analysis. METHODS: The sirVEnib and SARAH 
      merge PROject (VESPRO) is an individual, patient-data prospective meta-analysis of 
      the SIRveNIB and SARAH randomized trials. The VESPRO protocol includes prespecified 
      hypotheses, inclusion criteria, and outcome measures. The primary outcome measure is 
      overall survival and secondary outcomes include tumor response rate, 
      progression-free survival, progression in the liver as first event, and disease 
      control in the liver. Pooling of toxicity results will allow for robust safety 
      profiles to be established for both therapies, and provides increased statistical 
      power to investigate treatment effects in key subgroups. Analyses will be performed 
      in the intent-to-treat population stratified by trial. RESULTS: Both studies are 
      expected to demonstrate a survival benefit for SIRT together with a better toxicity 
      profile compared with sorafenib. It is also anticipated that liver progression as 
      the first event would be longer in the intervention compared with the control. 
      CONCLUSIONS: As the results of the 2 trials are not yet known, the methodological 
      strength is enhanced, as biases inherent in conventional meta-analyses are avoided. 
      This has the effect of providing this meta-analysis with the advantages of a single, 
      large,randomized study of 819 patients. It is anticipated that the SARAH and 
      SIRveNIB trial results will be published separately and together with the combined 
      meta-analysis results from VESPRO. The combined dataset will allow the effect of the 
      interventions to be explored with improved reliability/precision with respect to 
      prespecified patient and intervention-level characteristics. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Harms associated with taking nalmefene for substance use and impulse control 
      disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
PG  - e0183821
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0183821 [doi]
LID - e0183821
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Nalmefene is a newly approved drug for alcohol use disorder, but the 
      risk of harms has not been evaluated from empirical trial evidence. OBJECTIVE: To 
      assess the harm of nalmefene administered to individuals diagnosed with substance 
      use or impulse control disorders by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis 
      of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: A search was performed in Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014), MEDLINE via PubMed (1950), 
      EMBASE via Ovid (1974), and Clinicaltrials.gov through December 2014. STUDY 
      SELECTION: This study included only randomised controlled trials with placebo or 
      active controls that administered nalmefene to adult individuals for treating 
      impulse control and/or substance use disorders. Both published and unpublished 
      randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION AND 
      SYNTHESIS: Internal validity was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. 
      Published information from the trials was supplemented by contact between reviewers 
      and industry sponsor. Data were combined using two meta-approaches in fixed effects 
      models; Peto Odds Ratios and risk differences were reported with 95% confidence 
      intervals (95%CIs). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of patients with serious 
      adverse events, including specific psychiatric serious adverse events and 
      withdrawals due to adverse events. RESULTS: Of 20 potentially relevant studies, 15 
      randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, and 8 of these provided 
      data enabling the meta-analysis. Overall, serious adverse events did not occur more 
      often in the nalmefene group than in the placebo group (Peto Odds Ratio = 0.97 [95% 
      CI 0.64-1.44]; P = 0.86). Risk of psychiatric serious adverse events was slightly 
      elevated, albeit not at a statistically significant level (Peto Odds Ratio = 1.32 
      [95% CI 0.62, 2.83]; P = 0.47). Withdrawals due to adverse events were significantly 
      more likely to occur with nalmefene compared to placebo (Peto Odds Ratio = 3.22 [95% 
      CI 2.46-4.22]; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The three-fold increased risk of 
      withdrawal from treatment on nalmefene due to adverse events is a matter of safety 
      concern. The nature of these adverse events cannot be elucidated further without 
      access to individual patients data.

TI  - Statin therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome: an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials.
PG  - 663-671
LID - 10.1007/s00134-016-4649-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis to assess the 
      possible benefits and harms of statin therapy in adults with acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and to investigate effects in specific ARDS subgroups. 
      METHODS: We identified randomised clinical trials up to 31 October 2016 that had 
      investigated statin therapy versus placebo in patients with ARDS. Individual patient 
      data from each trial were compiled. Conventional two-stage meta-analyses were 
      performed for primary and secondary outcomes, and one-stage regression models with 
      single treatment-covariate interactions for subgroup analyses. Risk of bias was 
      assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS: Six trials with a total of 
      1755 patients were included. For the primary outcomes, there was no significant 
      effect of statin therapy on 28-day mortality [relative risk (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 
      0.86-1.23], ventilator-free days (mean difference 0.34 days, 95% CI -0.68 to 1.36) 
      or serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.84-1.53). There was a significantly 
      increased incidence of raised serum creatine kinase or transaminase levels with 
      statin therapy (106/879; 12.1%) versus control (78/876; 8.9%) (RR 1.40, 95% CI 
      1.07-1.83, p = 0.015). There were no significant treatment-covariate interactions in 
      the predefined subgroups investigated. CONCLUSIONS: We found no clinical benefit 
      from initiation of statin therapy in adult patients with ARDS, either overall or in 
      predefined subgroups. While there was an increased incidence of raised serum 
      creatine kinase and transaminase levels, there was no difference in serious adverse 
      events among groups. Therefore, we do not recommend initiation of statin therapy for 
      the treatment of ARDS.

TI  - Multiple imputation for IPD meta-analysis: allowing for heterogeneity and studies 
      with missing covariates.
PG  - 2938-54
LID - 10.1002/sim.6837 [doi]
AB  - Recently, multiple imputation has been proposed as a tool for individual patient 
      data meta-analysis with sporadically missing observations, and it has been suggested 
      that within-study imputation is usually preferable. However, such within study 
      imputation cannot handle variables that are completely missing within studies. 
      Further, if some of the contributing studies are relatively small, it may be 
      appropriate to share information across studies when imputing. In this paper, we 
      develop and evaluate a joint modelling approach to multiple imputation of individual 
      patient data in meta-analysis, with an across-study probability distribution for the 
      study specific covariance matrices. This retains the flexibility to allow for 
      between-study heterogeneity when imputing while allowing (i) sharing information on 
      the covariance matrix across studies when this is appropriate, and (ii) imputing 
      variables that are wholly missing from studies. Simulation results show both 
      equivalent performance to the within-study imputation approach where this is valid, 
      and good results in more general, practically relevant, scenarios with studies of 
      very different sizes, non-negligible between-study heterogeneity and wholly missing 
      variables. We illustrate our approach using data from an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis of hypertension trials. © 2015 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine

TI  - Bayesian evidence synthesis for exploring generalizability of treatment effects: a 
      case study of combining randomized and non-randomized results in diabetes.
PG  - 1654-75
LID - 10.1002/sim.6809 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we present a unified modeling framework to combine aggregated data 
      from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with individual participant data (IPD) from 
      observational studies. Rather than simply pooling the available evidence into an 
      overall treatment effect, adjusted for potential confounding, the intention of this 
      work is to explore treatment effects in specific patient populations reflected by 
      the IPD. In this way, by collecting IPD, we can potentially gain new insights from 
      RCTs' results, which cannot be seen using only a meta-analysis of RCTs. We present a 
      new Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression model, which combines submodels, 
      representing different types of data into a coherent analysis. Predictors of 
      baseline risk are estimated from the individual data. Simultaneously, a bivariate 
      random effects distribution of baseline risk and treatment effects is estimated from 
      the combined individual and aggregate data. Therefore, given a subgroup of interest, 
      the estimated treatment effect can be calculated through its correlation with 
      baseline risk. We highlight different types of model parameters: those that are the 
      focus of inference (e.g., treatment effect in a subgroup of patients) and those that 
      are used to adjust for biases introduced by data collection processes (e.g., 
      internal or external validity). The model is applied to a case study where RCTs' 
      results, investigating efficacy in the treatment of diabetic foot problems, are 
      extrapolated to groups of patients treated in medical routine and who were enrolled 
      in a prospective cohort study.

TI  - Early Change in Urine Protein as a Surrogate End Point in Studies of IgA 
      Nephropathy: An Individual-Patient Meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of change in proteinuria as a surrogate end point for 
      randomized trials in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) has previously not been 
      thoroughly evaluated. STUDY DESIGN: Individual patient-level meta-analysis. SETTING 
      & POPULATION: Individual-patient data for 830 patients from 11 randomized trials 
      evaluating 4 intervention types (renin-angiotensin system [RAS] blockade, fish oil, 
      immunosuppression, and steroids) examining associations between changes in urine 
      protein and clinical end points at the individual and trial levels. SELECTION 
      CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: Randomized controlled trials of IgAN with measurements of 
      proteinuria at baseline and a median of 9 (range, 5-12) months follow-up, with at 
      least 1 further year of follow-up for the clinical outcome. PREDICTOR: 9-month 
      change in proteinuria. OUTCOME: Doubling of serum creatinine level, end-stage renal 
      disease, or death. RESULTS: Early decline in proteinuria at 9 months was associated 
      with lower risk for the clinical outcome (HR per 50% reduction in proteinuria, 0.40; 
      95% CI, 0.32-0.48) and was consistent across studies. Proportions of treatment 
      effect on the clinical outcome explained by early decline in proteinuria were 
      estimated at 11% (95% CI, -19% to 41%) for RAS blockade and 29% (95% CI, 6% to 53%) 
      for steroid therapy. The direction of the pooled treatment effect on early change in 
      proteinuria was in accord with the direction of the treatment effect on the clinical 
      outcome for steroids and RAS blockade. Trial-level analyses estimated that the slope 
      for the regression line for the association of treatment effects on the clinical end 
      points and for the treatment effect on proteinuria was 2.15 (95% Bayesian credible 
      interval, 0.10-4.32). LIMITATIONS: Study population restricted to 11 trials, all 
      having fewer than 200 patients each with a limited number of clinical events. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results of this analysis offer novel evidence supporting the use of an 
      early reduction in proteinuria as a surrogate end point for clinical end points in 
      IgAN in selected settings.

AB  - The Adjuvant Colon Cancer End Points (ACCENT) Collaborative Group was formed 15 
      years ago to address scientific questions in early stage colon cancer that could 
      best be answered by pooling individual patient data across many randomized clinical 
      trials. Today, the ACCENT database contains detailed information collected from over 
      40,000 patients enrolled onto 27 major adjuvant colon cancer trials conducted 
      between 1977 and 2009. Since its inception, the ACCENT group has led many 
      sophisticated analyses addressing a variety of clinical questions, such as the 
      long-term survivorship of colon cancer patients by treatment, the time course of 
      oxaliplatin benefit, and support for the use of disease-free survival (DFS) as a 
      surrogate endpoint for overall survival (OS), among many others. Here, we provide an 
      updated overview of recent important results and future directions of the ACCENT 
      collaboration.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease and the risk of cancer: an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis of 32,057 participants from six prospective studies.
PG  - 488

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an established risk factor for 
      cardiovascular disease but the relevance of reduced kidney function to cancer risk 
      is uncertain. METHODS: Individual patient data were collected from six studies 
      (32,057 participants); including one population-based cohort and five randomized 
      controlled trials. Participants were grouped into one of five CKD categories 
      (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥75 mL/min/1.73 m(2); eGFR ≥60 to 
      <75 mL/min/1.73 m(2); eGFR ≥45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2); eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2); 
      on dialysis). Stratified Cox regression was used to assess the impact of CKD 
      category on cancer incidence and cancer death. RESULTS: Over a follow-up period of 
      170,000 person-years (mean follow-up among survivors 5.6 years), 2626 participants 
      developed cancer and 1095 participants died from cancer. Overall, there was no 
      significant association between CKD category and cancer incidence or death. As 
      compared with the reference group with eGFR ≥75 mL/min/1.73 m(2), adjusted hazard 
      ratio (HR) estimates for each category of renal function, in descending order, were: 
      0.98 (95 % CI 0.87-1.10), 0.99 (0.88-1.13), 1.01 (0.84-1.22) and 1.24 (0.97-1.58) 
      for cancer incidence, and 1.03 (95 % CI 0.86-1.24), 0.95 (0.78-1.16), 1.00 
      (0.76-1.33), and 1.58 (1.09-2.30) for cancer mortality. Among dialysis patients, 
      there was an excess risk of cancers of the urinary tract (adjusted HR: 2.34; 95 % CI 
      1.10-4.98) and endocrine cancers (11.65; 95 % CI: 1.30-104.12), and an excess risk 
      of death from digestive tract cancers (2.11; 95 % CI: 1.13-3.99), but a reduced risk 
      of prostate cancers (0.38; 95 % CI: 0.18-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst no association 
      between reduced renal function and the overall risk of cancer was observed, there 
      was evidence among dialysis patients that the risk of cancer was increased (urinary 
      tract, endocrine and digestive tract) or decreased (prostate) at specific sites. 
      Larger studies are needed to characterise these site-specific associations and to 
      identify their pathogenesis.

TI  - Assessment of the Cardiovascular Risk of Olmesartan Medoxomil-Based Treatment: 
      Meta-Analysis of Individual Patient Data.
PG  - 427-437
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Results from two long-term studies (ROADMAP and ORIENT) indicated a 
      numerical imbalance in the number of cardiovascular deaths between the olmesartan 
      medoxomil (OM) and placebo groups. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis to provide more complete information regarding 
      OM-associated cardiovascular risks and/or benefits. METHODS: We created an 
      integrated database based on 191 clinical trials from the OM development program. 
      Events were identified and adjudicated by an independent, blinded clinical events 
      committee. The incidence of major cardiovascular events and total mortality for OM 
      versus placebo/active control were evaluated, and the effect of OM on cardiovascular 
      mortality (main endpoint of interest) and morbidity was calculated using a two-stage 
      approach (Tian method). RESULTS: A total of 46 studies (~27,000 patients) met the US 
      FDA-specified inclusion criteria (phase II-IV randomized, double-blind, placebo- or 
      active-controlled studies [OM-based monotherapy or combination, double-blind period 
      ≥28 days] and adult patients). The incidence of known adjudicated endpoints in the 
      analysis of all studies combined was low among OM (0.11-0.53 %) and placebo/active 
      control (0.08-0.76 %) groups. For cardiovascular mortality, the estimated risk 
      difference (OM vs. control) was 0.00070 (95 % confidence interval [CI] -0.0011 to 
      0.0024; p = 0.60); the risk difference for each endpoint was <1/1000, with no 
      statistically significant difference between groups. Results were similar with and 
      without ROADMAP and ORIENT. DISCUSSION: The results from this meta-analysis did not 
      show a clinically meaningful or statistically significant difference in 
      cardiovascular risk between OM and the placebo/active control groups, and thus did 
      not corroborate the numerical imbalance observed in ROADMAP and ORIENT.

TI  - The OA Trial Bank: meta-analysis of individual patient data from knee and hip 
      osteoarthritis trials show that patients with severe pain exhibit greater benefit 
      from intra-articular glucocorticoids.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of intra-articular (IA) glucocorticoids for knee 
      or hip osteoarthritis (OA) in specific subgroups of patients with severe pain and 
      inflammatory signs using individual patient data (IPD) from existing trials. DESIGN: 
      Randomized trials evaluating one or more IA glucocorticoid preparation in patients 
      with knee or hip OA, published from 1995 up to June 2012 were selected from the 
      literature. IPD obtained from original trials included patient and disease 
      characteristics and outcomes measured. The primary outcome was pain severity at 
      short-term follow-up (up to 4 weeks). The subgroup factors assessed included severe 
      pain (≥70 points, 0-100 scale) and signs of inflammation (dichotomized in present or 
      not) at baseline. Multilevel regression analyses were applied to estimate the 
      magnitude of the effects in the subgroups with the individuals nested within each 
      study. RESULTS: Seven out of 43 published randomized clinical trials (n = 620) were 
      included. Patients with severe baseline pain had a significantly larger reduction in 
      short-term pain, but not in mid- and long-term pain, compared to those with less 
      severe pain at baseline (Mean Difference 13.91; 95% Confidence Interval 1.50-26.31) 
      when receiving IA glucocorticoid injection compared to placebo. No statistical 
      significant interaction effects were found between inflammatory signs and IA 
      glucocorticoid injections compared to placebo and to tidal irrigation at all 
      follow-up points. CONCLUSIONS: This IPD meta-analysis demonstrates that patients 
      with severe knee pain at baseline derive more benefit from IA glucocorticoid 
      injection at short-term follow-up than those with less severe pain at baseline.

TI  - Online hemodiafiltration and mortality risk in end-stage renal disease patients: A 
      critical appraisal of current evidence.
PG  - 159-168
LID - 10.23876/j.krcp.18.0160 [doi]
AB  - The life expectancy of end-stage renal disease patients undergoing regular 
      hemodialysis (HD) remains significantly lower than in the general population. 
      Reducing excess mortality by improving renal replacement options is an unmet medical 
      need. Online post-dilution hemodiafiltration (HDF) has been promoted as the gold 
      standard, offering improved clinical outcomes, based on numerous observational 
      studies that suggest a reduced mortality risk and lower morbidity with HDF compared 
      with standard HD. However, most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have failed to 
      demonstrate a significant beneficial effect of HDF on all-cause mortality. The 
      effects on secondary outcomes were often negligible or absent. Unfortunately, these 
      RCTs were characterized by a moderate to high risk of bias. In post-hoc analyses of 
      the largest RCTs and meta-analysis of individual participant data from four RCTs, 
      HDF patients receiving the highest convection volume consistently and 
      dose-dependently saw superior outcomes. However, as these studies were not designed 
      a priori to clarify this issue, and there are no indisputable mechanisms underlying 
      reduced mortality risks, we cannot exclude the possibility that the health status of 
      patients (with vascular access as a proxy) may affect outcomes more than the 
      convective technique itself. There is currently insufficient evidence to support the 
      contention that high-volume HDF confers relevant benefits to patients over standard 
      HD. The conflicting data of published RCTs reduce confidence in the superiority of 
      high-volume convective therapy. Hopefully, ongoing large RCTs (for example, 
      CONVINCE) may supply an indisputable answer to the crucial question of high-volume 
      HDF.

TI  - Impact of thoracic radiotherapy timing in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer: 
      usefulness of the individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 1818-28
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdw263 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy (CT) combined with radiotherapy is the standard treatment 
      of 'limited-stage' small-cell lung cancer. However, controversy persists over the 
      optimal timing of thoracic radiotherapy and CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried 
      out a meta-analysis of individual patient data in randomized trials comparing 
      earlier versus later radiotherapy, or shorter versus longer radiotherapy duration, 
      as defined in each trial. We combined the results from trials using the stratified 
      log-rank test to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs). The primary outcome was 
      overall survival. RESULTS: Twelve trials with 2668 patients were eligible. Data from 
      nine trials comprising 2305 patients were available for analysis. The median 
      follow-up was 10 years. When all trials were analysed together, 'earlier or shorter' 
      versus 'later or longer' thoracic radiotherapy did not affect overall survival. 
      However, the HR for overall survival was significantly in favour of 'earlier or 
      shorter' radiotherapy among trials with a similar proportion of patients who were 
      compliant with CT (defined as having received 100% or more of the planned CT cycles) 
      in both arms (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.91), and in favour of 'later or longer' 
      radiotherapy among trials with different rates of CT compliance (HR 1.19, 1.05-1.34, 
      interaction test, P < 0.0001). The absolute gain between 'earlier or shorter' versus 
      'later or longer' thoracic radiotherapy in 5-year overall survival for similar and 
      for different CT compliance trials was 7.7% (95% CI 2.6-12.8%) and -2.2% (-5.8% to 
      1.4%), respectively. However, 'earlier or shorter' thoracic radiotherapy was 
      associated with a higher incidence of severe acute oesophagitis than 'later or 
      longer' radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: 'Earlier or shorter' delivery of thoracic 
      radiotherapy with planned CT significantly improves 5-year overall survival at the 
      expense of more acute toxicity, especially oesophagitis.

TI  - Effect of levosimendan on prognosis in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a 
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Small trials suggest that levosimendan is associated with a favorable 
      outcome in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, recently published 
      larger-scale trials did not provide evidence for a similar benefit from 
      levosimendan. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the survival benefits of 
      levosimendan in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and to investigate its effects 
      in subgroups of patients with preoperative low-ejection fraction (EF). METHODS: We 
      identified randomized clinical trials through 20 April 2017 that investigated 
      levosimendan therapy versus control in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 
      Individual patient data from each study were compiled. Meta-analyses were performed 
      for primary outcomes, secondary outcomes and serious adverse events, and subgroup 
      analyses according to the preoperative EF of enrolled patients were also conducted. 
      The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: 
      Seventeen studies involving a total of 2756 patients were included. Levosimendan 
      therapy was associated with a significant reduction in 30-day mortality (RR 0.67; 
      95% CI, 0.49 to 0.93; p = 0.02) and reduced the risk of death in single-center 
      trials (RR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.79; p = 0.004) and in subgroup trials of inferior 
      quality (RR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.92; p = 0.02); however, in multicenter and in 
      high-quality subgroup-analysis trials, no significant difference in mortality was 
      observed between patients who received levosimendan therapy and controls (p > 0.05). 
      However, in high-quality subgroup trials, levosimendan therapy was associated with 
      reduced mortality in patients in a preoperative low-EF subgroup (RR 0.58; 95% CI, 
      0.38 to 0.88; p = 0.01). Similarly, only patients in the preoperative low-EF 
      subgroup benefited in terms of reduced risk of renal replacement therapy (RR 0.54; 
      95% CI, 0.34 to 0.85; p = 0.007). Furthermore, levosimendan therapy was associated 
      with a significant reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (MDR 
      -17.19; 95% CI, -34.43 to -2.94; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing 
      cardiac surgery, the benefit of levosimendan in terms of survival was not shown in 
      multicenter or in high-quality trials; however, levosimendan therapy was associated 
      with reduced mortality in patients with preoperative ventricular systolic 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Anthracycline versus nonanthracycline adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer: A 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e12908

AB  - PURPOSE: The clinical benefits provided by using anthracycline-contained regimens in 
      patients with early breast cancer (EBC) remain uncertain. This meta-analysis used 
      data from all relevant trials to compare treatment outcomes for patients with EBC 
      receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with non-anthracycline-contained regimens or 
      anthracycline-contained regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient data were 
      collected on 7 randomized trials comparing non-anthracycline-contained regimens with 
      anthracycline-contained regimens, a total of 14,451 women were analyzed. The hazard 
      ratios (HR) of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), and the risk 
      ratios for grades 3 to 4 toxicities were extracted from the retrieved studies and 
      analyzed using various statistical methods. A pooled analysis was accomplished and 
      HR with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) was derived. The significant differences 
      in DFS and OS were explored. A heterogeneity test was applied as well. RESULTS: 
      Among 7 eligible trials, significant differences in favor of anthracycline-contained 
      regimens were seen in DFS (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78-0.95; P = .003) and in OS (HR: 
      0.85; 95% CI: 0.75-0.97; P = .01). Subgroup analyses of DFS showed similar treatment 
      effects by hormone-receptor status and nodal status, but differential effects by 
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status, menopausal status, and malignancy 
      grade. Sensitive analysis showed that the DFS of taxanes and cyclophosphamide (TC) 
      was noninferior to anthracycline-contained regiments. CONCLUSION: Despite failing to 
      show noninferior to the anthracycline-contained regimens in patients with EBC, it 
      provides evidence that both regimens significantly improved the DFS and OS, and TC 
      regimen may be noninferior to anthracycline-contained regimens.

TI  - Lixisenatide Improves Glycemic Control in Asian Type 2 Diabetic Patients 
      Inadequately Controlled With Oral Antidiabetic Drugs: An Individual Patient Data 
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 777-792
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lixisenatide is a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Its efficacy and safety have been assessed in a 
      series of phase 3 studies included in the GetGoal program. In these studies, 
      lixisenatide was found to be superior to placebo in glycemic control. The aim of 
      this meta-analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy of lixisenatide as an 
      adjunct therapy in Asian patients with T2DM in adequately controlled with oral 
      antidiabetic drugs (OADs). METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis from five 
      lixisenatide phase 3 studies. In each of these multiethnic studies, patients with 
      T2DM inadequately controlled (glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c ≥7%) with established OADs 
      were randomized to lixisenatide or placebo for 24 weeks, with a balanced 
      distribution of Asian patients in these two arms (503 and 338 patients in the 
      intent-to-treat population, respectively). RESULTS: Lixisenatide was superior to 
      placebo in reducing HbA1c (weighted, total mean difference -0.57%; P = 0.002). More 
      patients treated with lixisenatide versus placebo achieved HbA1c targets of ≤7% 
      (49.1% vs. 28.4%, P = 0.003). Lixisenatide was superior to placebo in lowering 2-h 
      postprandial glucose (PPG) (weighted, total mean difference -5.50 mmol/l, 
      P = 0.0005). More patients treated with lixisenatide versus placebo achieved 2-h PPG 
      targets of ≤7.8 mmol/l (39.2% vs. 2.2%, P < 0.0001). More patients treated with 
      lixisenatide versus placebo achieved both an HbA1c target of ≤7% and a 2-h PPG 
      target of ≤10 mmol/l (34.8% vs. 2.69%, P < 0.00001). The body weight of the 
      lixisenatide group tended to decrease. Lixisenatide was generally well tolerated. 
      CONCLUSION: Lixisenatide as an adjunct therapy can significantly improve the 
      glycemic control of Asian patients with type 2 DM who do not meet targets for 
      glycemic control with an established OAD regimen. FUNDING: Sanofi (China) Investment

TI  - Bias and precision of methods for estimating the difference in restricted mean 
      survival time from an individual patient data meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The difference in restricted mean survival time ([Formula: see text]), 
      the area between two survival curves up to time horizon [Formula: see text], is 
      often used in cost-effectiveness analyses to estimate the treatment effect in 
      randomized controlled trials. A challenge in individual patient data (IPD) 
      meta-analyses is to account for the trial effect. We aimed at comparing different 
      methods to estimate the [Formula: see text] from an IPD meta-analysis. METHODS: We 
      compared four methods: the area between Kaplan-Meier curves (experimental vs. 
      control arm) ignoring the trial effect (Naïve Kaplan-Meier); the area between Peto 
      curves computed at quintiles of event times (Peto-quintile); the weighted average of 
      the areas between either trial-specific Kaplan-Meier curves (Pooled Kaplan-Meier) or 
      trial-specific exponential curves (Pooled Exponential). In a simulation study, we 
      varied the between-trial heterogeneity for the baseline hazard and for the treatment 
      effect (possibly correlated), the overall treatment effect, the time horizon 
      [Formula: see text], the number of trials and of patients, the use of fixed or 
      DerSimonian-Laird random effects model, and the proportionality of hazards. We 
      compared the methods in terms of bias, empirical and average standard errors. We 
      used IPD from the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Nasopharynx Carcinoma (MAC-NPC) 
      and its updated version MAC-NPC2 for illustration that included respectively 1,975 
      and 5,028 patients in 11 and 23 comparisons. RESULTS: The Naïve Kaplan-Meier method 
      was unbiased, whereas the Pooled Exponential and, to a much lesser extent, the 
      Pooled Kaplan-Meier methods showed a bias with non-proportional hazards. The 
      Peto-quintile method underestimated the [Formula: see text], except with 
      non-proportional hazards at [Formula: see text]= 5 years. In the presence of 
      treatment effect heterogeneity, all methods except the Pooled Kaplan-Meier and the 
      Pooled Exponential with DerSimonian-Laird random effects underestimated the standard 
      error of the [Formula: see text]. Overall, the Pooled Kaplan-Meier method with 
      DerSimonian-Laird random effects formed the best compromise in terms of bias and 
      variance. The [Formula: see text] estimated with the Pooled Kaplan-Meier method was 
      0.49 years (95% CI: [-0.06;1.03], p = 0.08) when comparing radiotherapy plus 
      chemotherapy vs. radiotherapy alone in the MAC-NPC and 0.59 years (95% CI: 
      [0.34;0.84], p < 0.0001) in the MAC-NPC2. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the Pooled 
      Kaplan-Meier method with DerSimonian-Laird random effects to estimate the difference 
      in restricted mean survival time from an individual-patient data meta-analysis.

TI  - Bleeding-Related Deaths in Relation to the Duration of Dual-Antiplatelet Therapy 
      After Coronary Stenting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have 
      suggested that prolonged dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) may be associated with 
      increased mortality, the mechanistic underpinnings of this association remain 
      unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the associations among 
      bleeding, mortality, and DAPT duration after drug-eluting stent implantation in a 
      meta-analysis of RCTs. METHODS: RCTs comparing different DAPT durations after 
      drug-eluting stent placement were sought through the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane 
      databases and the proceedings of international meetings. Deaths were considered 
      possibly bleeding related if occurring within 1 year of the episodes of bleeding. 
      Primary analysis was by intention-to-treat. Secondary analysis was performed in a 
      modified intention-to-treat population in which events occurring when all patients 
      were on DAPT were excluded. RESULTS: Individual patient data were obtained for 6 
      RCTs, and aggregate data were available for 12 RCTs. Patients with bleeding had 
      significantly higher rates of mortality compared with those without, and in a 
      time-adjusted multivariate analysis, bleeding was an independent predictor of 
      mortality occurring within 1 year of the bleeding episode (hazard ratio: 6.93; 95% 
      confidence interval: 4.53 to 10.60; p < 0.0001). Shorter DAPT was associated with 
      lower rates of all-cause death compared with longer DAPT (hazard ratio: 0.85; 95% 
      confidence interval: 0.73 to 1.00; p = 0.05), which was driven by lower rates of 
      bleeding-related deaths with shorter DAPT compared with prolonged DAPT (hazard 
      ratio: 0.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.43 to 0.99; p = 0.04). Mortality unrelated 
      to bleeding was comparable between the 2 groups. Similar results were apparent in 
      the modified intention-to-treat population. CONCLUSIONS: Bleeding was strongly 
      associated with the occurrence of mortality within 1 year after the bleeding event. 
      Shorter compared with longer DAPT was associated with lower risk for 
      bleeding-related death, a finding that may underlie the lower all-cause mortality 
      with shorter DAPT in the RCTs of different DAPT durations after DES.

TI  - Interventions for preventing high altitude illness: Part 2. Less commonly-used 
      drugs.
PG  - CD012983
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD012983 [doi]
LID - CD012983
AB  - BACKGROUND: High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of mainly 
      cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 
      2500 metres (˜ 8200 feet). Acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral 
      oedema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential 
      medical problems associated with high altitude ascent. In this second review, in a 
      series of three about preventive strategies for HAI, we assessed the effectiveness 
      of five of the less commonly used classes of pharmacological interventions. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of five of the 
      less commonly used pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI in 
      participants who are at risk of developing high altitude illness in any setting. 
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and the World Health Organization International 
      Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) in May 2017. We adapted the MEDLINE 
      strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus-based 
      and free-text search terms. We scanned the reference lists and citations of included 
      trials and any relevant systematic reviews that we identified for further references 
      to additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials 
      conducted in any setting where one of five classes of drugs was employed to prevent 
      acute HAI: selective 5-hydroxytryptamine(1) receptor agonists; N-methyl-D-aspartate 
      (NMDA) antagonist; endothelin-1 antagonist; anticonvulsant drugs; and 
      spironolactone. We included trials involving participants who are at risk of 
      developing high altitude illness (AMS or HACE, or HAPE, or both). We included 
      participants with and without a history of high altitude illness. We applied no age 
      or gender restrictions. We included trials where the relevant medication was 
      administered before the beginning of ascent. We excluded trials using these drugs 
      during ascent or after ascent. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard 
      methodological procedures employed by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight 
      studies (334 participants, 9 references) in this review. Twelve studies are ongoing 
      and will be considered in future versions of this review as appropriate. We have 
      been unable to obtain full-text versions of a further 12 studies and have designated 
      them as 'awaiting classification'. Four studies were at a low risk of bias for 
      randomization; two at a low risk of bias for allocation concealment. Four studies 
      were at a low risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel. We considered 
      three studies at a low risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessors. We considered 
      most studies at a high risk of selective reporting bias.We report results for the 
      following four main comparisons.Sumatriptan versus placebo (1 parallel study; 102 
      participants)Data on sumatriptan showed a reduction of the risk of AMS when compared 
      with a placebo (risk ratio (RR) = 0.43, CI 95% 0.21 to 0.84; 1 study, 102 
      participants; low quality of evidence). The one included study did not report events 
      of HAPE, HACE or adverse events related to administrations of sumatriptan.Magnesium 
      citrate versus placebo (1 parallel study; 70 participants)The estimated RR for AMS, 
      comparing magnesium citrate tablets versus placebo, was 1.09 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.13; 1 
      study; 70 participants; low quality of evidence). In addition, the estimated RR for 
      loose stools was 3.25 (95% CI 1.17 to 8.99; 1 study; 70 participants; low quality of 
      evidence). The one included study did not report events of HAPE or 
      HACE.Spironolactone versus placebo (2 parallel studies; 205 participants)Pooled 
      estimation of RR for AMS was not performed due to considerable heterogeneity between 
      the included studies (I² = 72%). RR from individual studies was 0.40 (95% CI 0.12 to 
      1.31) and 1.44 (95% CI 0.79 to 2.01; very low quality of evidence). No events of 
      HAPE or HACE were reported. Adverse events were not evaluated.Acetazolamide versus 
      spironolactone (1 parallel study; 232 participants)Data on acetazolamide compared 
      with spironolactone showed a reduction of the risk of AMS with the administration of 
      acetazolamide (RR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.70; 232 participants; low quality of 
      evidence). No events of HAPE or HACE were reported. Adverse events were not 
      evaluated. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This Cochrane Review is the second in a series of 
      three providing relevant information to clinicians and other interested parties on 
      how to prevent high altitude illness. The assessment of five of the less commonly 
      used classes of drugs suggests that there is a scarcity of evidence related to these 
      interventions. Clinical benefits and harms related to potential interventions such 
      as sumatriptan are still unclear. Overall, the evidence is limited due to the low 
      number of studies identified (for most of the comparison only one study was 
      identified); limitations in the quality of the evidence (moderate to low); and the 
      number of studies pending classification (24 studies awaiting classification or 
      ongoing). We lack the large and methodologically sound studies required to establish 
      or refute the efficacy and safety of most of the pharmacological agents evaluated in 
      this review.

TI  - Baseline Depression Severity as Moderator of Depression Outcomes Between Cognitive 
      Behavioral Therapy vs Pharmacotherapy: An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1102-9
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.1516 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Current guidelines recommend treating severe depression with 
      pharmacotherapy. Randomized clinical trials as well as traditional meta-analyses 
      have considerable limitations in testing for moderators of treatment outcomes. 
      OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic literature search, collect primary data from 
      trials, and analyze baseline depression severity as a moderator of treatment 
      outcomes between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication 
      (ADM). DATA SOURCES: A total of 14 902 abstracts were examined from a comprehensive 
      literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Cochrane Registry of Controlled 
      Trials from 1966 to January 1, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials in 
      which CBT and ADM were compared in patients with a DSM-defined depressive disorder 
      were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study authors were asked to provide 
      primary data from their trial. Primary data from 16 of 24 identified trials (67%), 
      with 1700 outpatients (794 from the CBT condition and 906 from the ADM condition), 
      were included. Missing data were imputed with multiple imputation methods. 
      Mixed-effects models adjusting for study-level differences were used to examine 
      baseline depression severity as a moderator of treatment outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Seventeen-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Beck 
      Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS: There was a main effect of ADM over CBT on the 
      HAM-D (β = -0.88; P = .03) and a nonsignificant trend on the BDI (β = -1.14; 
      P = .08, statistical test for trend), but no significant differences in response 
      (odds ratio [OR], 1.24; P = .12) or remission (OR, 1.18; P = .22). Mixed-effects 
      models using the HAM-D indicated that baseline depression severity does not moderate 
      reductions in depressive symptoms between CBT and ADM at outcome (β = 0.00; 
      P = .96). Similar results were seen using the BDI. Baseline depression severity also 
      did not moderate the likelihood of response (OR, 0.99; P = .77) or remission (OR, 
      1.00; P = .93) between CBT and ADM. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Baseline depression 
      severity did not moderate differences between CBT and ADM on the HAM-D or BDI or in 
      response or remission. This finding cannot be extrapolated to other psychotherapies, 
      to individual ADMs, or to inpatients. However, it offers new and substantial 
      evidence that is of relevance to researchers, physicians and therapists, and 
      patients.

AB  - RATIONALE: The meta-Analysis of Cell-based CaRdiac study is the first prospectively 
      declared collaborative multinational database, including individual data of patients 
      with ischemic heart disease treated with cell therapy. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the 
      safety and efficacy of intracoronary cell therapy after acute myocardial infarction 
      (AMI), including individual patient data from 12 randomized trials (ASTAMI, Aalst, 
      BOOST, BONAMI, CADUCEUS, FINCELL, REGENT, REPAIR-AMI, SCAMI, SWISS-AMI, TIME, 
      LATE-TIME; n=1252). METHODS AND RESULTS: The primary end point was freedom from 
      combined major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (including all-cause 
      death, AMI recurrance, stroke, and target vessel revascularization). The secondary 
      end point was freedom from hard clinical end points (death, AMI recurrence, or 
      stroke), assessed with random-effects meta-analyses and Cox regressions for 
      interactions. Secondary efficacy end points included changes in end-diastolic 
      volume, end-systolic volume, and ejection fraction, analyzed with random-effects 
      meta-analyses and ANCOVA. We reported weighted mean differences between cell therapy 
      and control groups. No effect of cell therapy on major adverse cardiac and 
      cerebrovascular events (14.0% versus 16.3%; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence 
      interval, 0.63-1.18) or death (1.4% versus 2.1%) or death/AMI recurrence/stroke 
      (2.9% versus 4.7%) was identified in comparison with controls. No changes in 
      ejection fraction (mean difference: 0.96%; 95% confidence interval, -0.2 to 2.1), 
      end-diastolic volume, or systolic volume were observed compared with controls. These 
      results were not influenced by anterior AMI location, reduced baseline ejection 
      fraction, or the use of MRI for assessing left ventricular parameters. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized trials in patients 
      with recent AMI revealed that intracoronary cell therapy provided no benefit, in 
      terms of clinical events or changes in left ventricular function. CLINICAL TRIAL

PG  - 2881-98
LID - 10.1002/sim.6556 [doi]
AB  - Meta-analysis of time-to-event outcomes using the hazard ratio as a treatment effect 
      measure has an underlying assumption that hazards are proportional. The between-arm 
      difference in the restricted mean survival time is a measure that avoids this 
      assumption and allows the treatment effect to vary with time. We describe and 
      evaluate meta-analysis based on the restricted mean survival time for dealing with 
      non-proportional hazards and present a diagnostic method for the overall 
      proportional hazards assumption. The methods are illustrated with the application to 
      two individual participant meta-analyses in cancer. The examples were chosen because 
      they differ in disease severity and the patterns of follow-up, in order to 
      understand the potential impacts on the hazards and the overall effect estimates. We 
      further investigate the estimation methods for restricted mean survival time by a 
      simulation study.

PG  - e15075
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000015075 [doi]
LID - e15075
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous clinical trials have reported that ivabradine can effectively 
      treat heart failure (HF). However, no systematic review has explored its efficacy 
      and safety for HF. This systematic review will aim to evaluate the efficacy and 
      safety of ivabradine for the treatment of patients with HF. METHODS: We will search 
      the literature from the following electronic databases from inception to the January 
      31, 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, MEDILINE, Web of 
      Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and 
      Complementary Medicine Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China 
      National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Information, and Wanfang Data. All randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) of ivabradine for HF will be fully considered for inclusion 
      without any restrictions. Additionally, grey literature including clinical trial 
      registries, dissertations, and reference lists of included studies, conference 
      abstracts will also be searched. Two researchers will review these literatures, 
      extract data, and assess risk of bias of included RCTs separately. Data will be 
      pooled by either fixed-effects model or random-effects model, and meta-analysis will 
      be conducted if it is appropriate. RESULTS: The primary outcome is all-cause 
      mortality. The secondary outcomes comprise of change in body weight, urine output, 
      change in serum sodium, and all adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this 
      study will summary provide up-to-dated evidence for assessing the efficacy and 
      safety of ivabradine for HF. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: It is not necessary to 
      acquire ethical approval for this systematic review, because no individual patient 
      data will be used in this study. The results of this systematic review will be 
      published through peer-reviewed journals. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of antipsychotics across the initial severity range in 
      patients with acute mania remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the influence of 
      baseline severity on the efficacy of olanzapine. METHODS: We did an individual 
      participant data meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that 
      compared olanzapine with placebo, identified through searches of the 
      ClinicalStudyRequest.com database on Feb 2, 2016. We included patients with acute 
      mania associated with bipolar I disorder. We examined the association between 
      baseline and change scores on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; range 0-60) up to 
      3 weeks for olanzapine versus placebo groups using eight increasingly complex 
      competing mixed-effects models for repeated measures. FINDINGS: We identified 33 
      reports, five (15%) of which were eligible and contained data for 939 patients (552 
      received olanzapine; 387 received placebo). The interaction between baseline 
      severity and treatment was significant (β=0·22, 95% CI 0·05-0·39; p=0·013). The 
      greater the baseline severity, the greater the magnitude of the differences between 
      olanzapine and placebo was expected. The mean estimated YMRS scores were reduced at 
      3 weeks in both groups, but were greater with olazapine than placebo by 2·56 points 
      for patients with a baseline score of 20-25 (9·26 for olanzapine vs 6·70 for 
      placebo; effect size 0·35, 95% CI 0·11-0·60), by 4·74 points for a baseline score of 
      25-35 (14·25 vs 9·51; 0·58, 0·34-0·86), and by 8·01 points for a baseline score of 
      35-60 (21·72 vs 13·71; 0·70, 0·31-1·23). INTERPRETATION: Benefits of olanzapine can 
      be expected for patients across the full spectrum of symptom severity who are likely 
      to be treated for acute mania. Less severely ill patients seem to benefit less in 
      terms of olanzapine efficacy, but still experience the same side-effects as more 
      severely ill patients. Thus, clinicians and patients should carefully consider the 
      benefit-to-risk ratio of olanzapine and its additional, prophylactic effect against 
      relapse in the long term. The generalisability of these results to other 
      antipsychotics, trial designs, and medical conditions remains to be established. 
      FUNDING: None.

TI  - Investigating the heterogeneity of alkylating agents' efficacy and toxicity between 
      sexes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing 
      cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide (MAIAGE study).
LID - 10.1002/pbc.26457 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A marginal interaction between sex and the type of alkylating agent was 
      observed for event-free survival in the Euro-EWING99-R1 randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT) comparing cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide in Ewing sarcoma. To further 
      evaluate this interaction, we performed an individual patient data meta-analysis of 
      RCTs assessing cyclophosphamide versus ifosfamide in any type of cancer. METHODS: A 
      literature search produced two more eligible RCTs (EICESS92 and IRS-IV). The 
      endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS, main endpoint) and overall survival 
      (OS). The hazard ratios (HRs) of the treatment-by-sex interaction and their 95% 
      confidence interval (95% CI) were assessed using stratified multivariable Cox 
      models. Heterogeneity of the interaction across age categories and trials was 
      explored. We also assessed this interaction for severe acute toxicity using logistic 
      models. RESULTS: The meta-analysis comprised 1,528 pediatric and young adult sarcoma 
      patients from three RCTs: Euro-EWING99-R1 (n = 856), EICESS92 (n = 155), and IRS-IV 
      (n = 517). There were 224 PFS events in Euro-EWING99-R1 and 200 in the validation 
      set (EICESS92 + IRS-IV), and 171 and 154 deaths in each dataset, respectively. The 
      estimated treatment-by-sex interaction for PFS in Euro-EWING99-R1 (HR = 1.73, 95% CI 
      = 1.00-3.00) was not replicated in the validation set (HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 
      0.55-1.72), without heterogeneity across trials (P = 0.62). In the pooled analysis, 
      the treatment-by-sex interaction was not significant (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.89-1.95, 
      P = 0.17), without heterogeneity across age categories (P = 0.88) and trials (P = 
      0.36). Similar results were observed for OS. No significant treatment-by-sex 
      interaction was observed for leucopenia/neutropenia (P = 0.45), infection (P = 
      0.64), or renal toxicity (P = 0.20). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis did not confirm 
      the hypothesis of a treatment-by-sex interaction on efficacy or toxicity outcomes.

      dementia: protocol for a systematic review and individual patient data network

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and 
      several organisations, such as the National Institute for Health and Care 
      Excellence, suggest that management of patients with AD should be tailored to their 
      needs. To date, little research has been conducted on the treatment effect in 
      different subgroups of patients with AD. The aim of this study is to examine the 
      comparative effectiveness and safety of cognitive enhancers for different patient 
      characteristics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will update our previous literature search 
      from January 2015 forward, using the same terms and electronic databases (eg, 
      MEDLINE) from our previous review. We will additionally search grey literature and 
      scan the reference lists of the included studies. Randomised clinical trials of any 
      duration conducted at any time comparing cognitive enhancers alone or in any 
      combination against other cognitive enhancers, or placebo in adults with AD will be 
      eligible. The outcomes of interest are cognition according to the Mini-Mental State 
      Examination, and overall serious adverse events. For each outcome and treatment 
      comparison, we will perform a Bayesian hierarchical random-effects meta-analysis 
      combining the individual patient data (IPD) from each eligible study. If the 
      identified treatment comparisons form a connected network diagram, we will perform 
      an IPD network meta-analysis (NMA) to estimate subgroup effects for patients with 
      different characteristics, such as AD severity and sex. We will combine aggregated 
      data from studies that we will not be able to obtain IPD, with the IPD provided by 
      the original authors, in a single model. We will use the PRISMA-IPD and PRISMA-NMA 
      statements to report our findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings of this 
      study will be of interest to stakeholders, including decision makers, guideline 
      developers, clinicians, methodologists and patients, and they will help to improve 
      guidelines for the management of patients with AD. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      CRD42015023507.

TI  - Research Review: Harnessing the power of individual participant data in a 
      meta-analysis of the benefits and harms of the Incredible Years parenting program.
PG  - 99-109
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.12781 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parenting programs aim to reduce children's conduct problems through 
      improvement of family dynamics. To date, research on the precise benefits and 
      possible harms of parenting programs on family well-being has been unsystematic and 
      likely to be subject to selective outcome reporting and publication bias. Better 
      understanding of program benefits and harms requires full disclosure by researchers 
      of all included measures, and large enough numbers of participants to be able to 
      detect small effects and estimate them precisely. METHODS: We obtained individual 
      participant data for 14 of 15 randomized controlled trials on the Incredible Years 
      parenting program in Europe (total N = 1,799). We used multilevel modeling to 
      estimate program effects on 13 parent-reported outcomes, including parenting 
      practices, children's mental health, and parental mental health. RESULTS: Parental 
      use of praise, corporal punishment, threats, and shouting improved, while parental 
      use of tangible rewards, monitoring, or laxness did not. Children's conduct problems 
      and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms improved, while 
      emotional problems did not. Parental mental health (depressive symptoms, 
      self-efficacy, and stress) did not improve. There was no evidence of harmful 
      effects. CONCLUSIONS: The Incredible Years parenting program improves the aspects of 
      family well-being that it is primarily designed to improve: parenting and children's 
      conduct problems. It also improves parent-reported ADHD symptoms in children. Wider 
      benefits are limited: the program does not improve children's emotional problems or 
      parental mental health. There are no signs of harm on any of the target outcomes.

TI  - Evidence synthesis from aggregate recurrent event data for clinical trial design and 
      analysis.
PG  - 867-882
LID - 10.1002/sim.7549 [doi]
AB  - Information from historical trials is important for the design, interim monitoring, 
      analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials. Meta-analytic models can be used to 
      synthesize the evidence from historical data, which are often only available in 
      aggregate form. We consider evidence synthesis methods for trials with recurrent 
      event endpoints, which are common in many therapeutic areas. Such endpoints are 
      typically analyzed by negative binomial regression. However, the individual patient 
      data necessary to fit such a model are usually unavailable for historical trials 
      reported in the medical literature. We describe approaches for back-calculating 
      model parameter estimates and their standard errors from available summary 
      statistics with various techniques, including approximate Bayesian computation. We 
      propose to use a quadratic approximation to the log-likelihood for each historical 
      trial based on 2 independent terms for the log mean rate and the log of the 
      dispersion parameter. A Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis model then provides the 
      posterior predictive distribution for these parameters. Simulations show this 
      approach with back-calculated parameter estimates results in very similar inference 
      as using parameter estimates from individual patient data as an input. We illustrate 
      how to design and analyze a new randomized placebo-controlled exacerbation trial in 
      severe eosinophilic asthma using data from 11 historical trials.

AB  - Computer-based approaches, such as Attention Bias Modification (ABM), could help 
      improve access to care for anxiety. Study-level meta-analyses of ABM have produced 
      conflicting findings and leave critical questions unresolved regarding ABM's 
      mechanisms of action and clinical potential. We pooled patient-level datasets from 
      randomized controlled trials of children and adults with high-anxiety. Attentional 
      bias (AB) towards threat, the target mechanism of ABM, was tested as an outcome and 
      a mechanistic mediator and moderator of anxiety reduction. Diagnostic remission and 
      Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) were clinical outcomes available in enough 
      studies to enable pooling. Per-patient data were obtained on at least one outcome 
      from 13/16 eligible studies [86% of eligible participants; n=778]. Significant main 
      effects of ABM on diagnostic remission (ABM-22.6%, control-10.8%; OR=2.57; p=0.006) 
      and AB (β* (95%CI)=-0.63 (-0.83, -0.42); p<0.00005) were observed. There was no main 
      effect of ABM on LSAS. However, moderator analyses suggested ABM was effective for 
      patients who were younger (≤37y), trained in the lab, and/or assessed by clinicians. 
      Under the same conditions where ABM was effective, mechanistic links between AB and 
      anxiety reduction were supported. Under these specific circumstances, ABM reduces 
      anxiety and acts through its target mechanism, supporting ABM's theoretical basis 
      while simultaneously suggesting clinical indications and refinements to improve its 
      currently limited clinical potential.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Selective digestive decontamination (SDD) and selective oropharyngeal 
      decontamination (SOD) improved intensive care unit (ICU), hospital and 28-day 
      survival in ICUs with low levels of antibiotic resistance. Yet it is unclear whether 
      the effect differs between medical and surgical ICU patients. METHODS: In an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed and 
      included all randomized controlled studies published since 2000. We performed a 
      two-stage meta-analysis with separate logistic regression models per study and per 
      outcome (hospital survival and ICU survival) and subsequent pooling of main and 
      interaction effects. RESULTS: Six studies, all performed in countries with low 
      levels of antibiotic resistance, yielded 16 528 hospital admissions and 17 884 ICU 
      admissions for complete case analysis. Compared to standard care or placebo, the 
      pooled adjusted odds ratios for hospital mortality was 0.82 (95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 0.72-0.93) for SDD and 0.84 (95% CI 0.73-0.97) for SOD. Compared to SOD, the 
      adjusted odds ratio for hospital mortality was 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-0.97) for SDD. The 
      effects on hospital mortality were not modified by type of ICU admission (p values 
      for interaction terms were 0.66 for SDD and control, 0.87 for SOD and control and 
      0.47 for SDD and SOD). Similar results were found for ICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      ICUs with low levels of antibiotic resistance, the effectiveness of SDD and SOD was 
      not modified by type of ICU admission. SDD and SOD improved hospital and ICU 
      survival compared to standard care in both patient populations, with SDD being more 
      effective than SOD.

TI  - Does Insight Affect the Efficacy of Antipsychotics in Acute Mania?: An Individual 
      Patient Data Regression Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 71-6
LID - 10.1097/JCP.0000000000000435 [doi]
AB  - Patients having an acute manic episode of bipolar disorder often lack insight into 
      their condition. Because little is known about the possible effect of insight on 
      treatment efficacy, we examined whether insight at the start of treatment affects 
      the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment in patients with acute mania. We used 
      individual patient data from 7 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
      registration studies of 4 antipsychotics in patients with acute mania (N = 1904). 
      Insight was measured with item 11 of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) at baseline 
      and study endpoint 3 weeks later. Treatment outcome was defined by (a) mean change 
      score, (b) response defined as 50% or more improvement on YMRS, and (c) remission 
      defined as YMRS score less than 8 at study endpoint. We used multilevel mixed effect 
      linear (or logistic) regression analyses of individual patient data to assess the 
      interaction between baseline insight and treatment outcomes. At treatment 
      initiation, 1207 (63.5%) patients had impaired or no insight into their condition. 
      Level of insight significantly modified the efficacy of treatment by mean change 
      score (P = 0.039), response rate (P = 0.033), and remission rate (P = 0.043), with 
      greater improvement in patients with more impaired insight. We therefore recommend 
      that patients experiencing acute mania should be treated immediately and not be 
      delayed until patients regain insight.

TI  - Identifying placebo responders and predictors of response in osteoarthritis: a 
      protocol for individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - 183
LID - 183
AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of osteoarthritis (OA) is unsatisfactory, as most 
      treatments are not clinically effective over placebo and most drugs have 
      considerable side effects. On average, 75 % of the analgesic effect from OA 
      treatments in clinical trials can be attributed to a placebo response, and this 
      response varies greatly from patient to patient. This individual patient data (IPD) 
      meta-analysis aims to identify placebo responders and the potential determinants of 
      the placebo response in OA. METHODS: This study is undertaken in conjunction with 
      the OA Trial Bank, an ongoing international consortium aiming to collect IPD from 
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for all treatments of OA. RCTs for each 
      treatment of OA have been systematically searched for, and authors of the relevant 
      trials have been contacted to request the IPD. We will use the IPD of 
      placebo-controlled RCTs held by the OA Trial Bank for this project. The IPD in 
      placebo groups will be used to investigate the placebo response according to the 
      minimum clinically important difference (MCID) threshold (e.g. 20 % pain reduction). 
      Responders to placebo will be compared with non-responders to identify predictors of 
      response. The quality of the trials will be assessed and potential determinants will 
      be examined using multilevel logistic regression analyses. DISCUSSION: This study 
      explores the varying magnitude of the placebo response and the proportion of 
      participants that experience a clinically important placebo effect in OA RCTs. 
      Potential determinants of the placebo response will also be investigated. These 
      determinants may be useful for future studies as it may allow participants to be 
      stratified into groups based on their likely response to placebo. The results of 
      this study may also be useful for pharmaceutical companies, who could improve the 
      design of their studies in order to separate the specific treatment from the 
      non-specific contextual (i.e. placebo) effects. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

TI  - Early Nonresponse in the Antipsychotic Treatment of Acute Mania: A Criterion for 
      Reconsidering Treatment? Results From an Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e1117-e1123
LID - 10.4088/JCP.15r10051 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether early nonresponse to antipsychotic treatment of 
      acute mania predicts treatment failure and, if so, to establish the best definition 
      or criterion of an early nonresponse. DATA SOURCES: Short-term efficacy studies 
      assessing antipsychotics that were submitted to the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board 
      during an 11-year period as part of the marketing authorization application for the 
      indication of acute manic episode of bipolar disorder. Pharmaceutical companies 
      provided their raw patient data, which enabled us to perform an individual patient 
      data meta-analysis. STUDY SELECTION: All double-blind, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of antipsychotics for acute manic 
      episode of bipolar disorder were included (10 trials). DATA EXTRACTION: All patients 
      with data available for completer analysis (N = 1,243), symptom severity scores on 
      the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) at weeks 0, 1, and 2 and at study end point 
      (week 3 or 4). RESULTS: The a priori chances of nonresponse and nonremission at 
      study end point were 40.9% (95% CI, 38.2%-43.6%) and 65.3% (95% CI, 62.0%-68.6%), 
      respectively. Early nonresponse in weeks 1 and 2, defined by cutoff scores ranging 
      from a ≤ 10% to a ≤ 50% reduction in symptoms compared to baseline on the YMRS, 
      significantly predicted nonresponse (≤ 0% symptom reduction) and nonremission (YMRS 
      score higher than 8) in week 3. The predictive value of early nonresponse (PVnr_se) 
      at week 1 for both nonresponse and nonremission at study end point declined linearly 
      with increasing cutoff scores of early nonresponse; nonresponse: 76.0% (95% CI, 
      69.7%-82.3%) for a ≤ 10% response to 48.7% (95% CI, 45.5%-51.9%) for a ≤ 50% 
      response; nonremission: 92.2% (95% CI, 88.3%-96.1%) for a ≤ 10% response to 76.8% 
      (95% CI, 74.4%-79.5%) for a ≤ 50% response. A similar linear decline was observed 
      for increasing cutoff scores of early nonresponse at week 2 for nonresponse, but not 
      for nonremission at end point: nonresponse 90.3% (95% CI, 84.6%-96.0%) for a ≤ 10% 
      response to 65.0% (95% CI, 61.4%-68.6%) for a ≤ 50% response; nonremission: 94.2% 
      (95% CI, 89.7%-98.7%) for a ≤ 10% response and 93.2% (95% CI, 93.1%-95.1%) for a ≤ 
      50% response. Specific antipsychotic characteristics did not modify these findings 
      at either time point (week 1: P = .127; week 2: P = .213). CONCLUSIONS: When 
      patients fail to respond early (1-2 weeks) after the initiation of antipsychotic 
      treatment for acute mania, clinicians should reconsider their treatment choice using 
      a 2-stage strategy.

TI  - Paclitaxel-eluting versus bare metal stents in primary PCI: a pooled patient-level 
      meta-analysis of randomized trials.
PG  - 101-12
LID - 10.1007/s11239-014-1091-4 [doi]
AB  - Concerns have emerged regarding a higher risk of stent thrombosis after drug-eluting 
      stent (DES) implantation, especially in the setting of ST-segment elevation 
      myocardial infarction (STEMI). Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis based on 
      individual patient data to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of 
      paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) as compared to bare metal stents (BMS) in patients 
      undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI. We examined 
      all completed randomized trials on PES for STEMI. Individual patient data were 
      obtained from six trials. We performed survival analyses with the use of 
      Cox-regression analysis stratified according to trial. Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
      are presented with event rates reported as estimated probabilities. A subsequent 
      landmark analysis was performed for patients who were event-free at 1-year follow-up 
      in order to define outcome in terms of early (≤1 year) and late (>1 year) events. A 
      total of six trials were finally included in the meta-analysis with 4435 patients, 
      2875 (64.8 %) assigned to PES and 1560 (35.2 %) to BMS. No significant differences 
      in baseline characteristics were observed between the two groups. However, a 
      significantly higher percentage of patients in the DES group were on dual 
      antiplatelet therapy during 3-year follow-up, as compared to BMS. At long-term 
      follow-up (1,095 [1,090-1,155] days), no significant difference between PES and BMS 
      was observed in mortality (9.2 vs 11.9 %, respectively, HR [95 % CI] = 0.84 [0.67, 
      1.06], p = 0.15, pheterogeneity = 0.59), reinfarction (8.8 vs 7 %, respectively; HR 
      [95 % CI] = 1.10 [0.84, 1.44], p = 0.51, pheterogeneity = 0.32), stent thrombosis 
      (6.7 vs 4.0 % respectively, HR [95 % CI] = 1.13 [0.82, 1.55], p = 0.45, 
      pheterogeneity = 0.99) and TVR (11.9 vs 20.0 %; HR [95 % CI] = 0.64 [0.54, 0.77], 
      p < 0.0001, pheterogeneity = 0.25). Landmark analysis showed that PES was associated 
      with a significantly higher rate of very late reinfarction (>1 year) (5.6 vs 3.9 %, 
      HR [95 % CI] = 1.61 [1.05-2.47], p = 0.03, pheterogeneity = 0.51], very late ST (2.9 
      vs 1.1 %, HR [95 % CI] = 1.88 [1.00-3.54], p = 0.05, pheterogeneity = 0.94]. The 
      present pooled patient-level meta-analysis demonstrates that among STEMI patients 
      undergoing primary PCI, PES compared to BMS is associated with a significant 
      reduction in TVR at long-term follow-up. Although there were no differences in 
      cumulative mortality, reinfarction or stent thrombosis, the incidence of very late 
      reinfarction and stent thrombosis was increased with PES.

TI  - Intensive Blood Pressure Lowering in Patients With and Patients Without Type 2 
      Diabetes: A Pooled Analysis From Two Randomized Trials.
PG  - 1142-1148
LID - 10.2337/dc17-1722 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Blood Pressure 
      (ACCORD-BP) study did not find a significant beneficial effect of intensive systolic 
      blood pressure (SBP) lowering on cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention 
      Trial (SPRINT) did find a significant beneficial effect in patients without T2DM. 
      The objective of this analysis was to assess the effect of both T2DM and baseline 
      cardiovascular disease risk on the treatment effect of intensive blood pressure 
      lowering. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The individual patient data from the 
      ACCORD-BP and SPRINT studies were pooled and follow-up durations harmonized. Both 
      studies randomized hypertensive patients to an SBP target of <120 mmHg or a target 
      of <140 mmHg. The composite primary end point consisted of unstable angina, 
      myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular death. The 
      interaction between intensive blood pressure lowering and both T2DM and 10-year 
      cardiovascular risk was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The 
      cohort consisted of 14,094 patients with mean age 66 ± 8.9 years and mean baseline 
      SBP 139.5 ± 15.6 mmHg; 33.6% had T2DM. The hazard ratio for the primary composite 
      end point was 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.93), P = 0.0017. The interaction between intensive 
      blood pressure lowering and T2DM was nonsignificant (P = 0.13). The 10-year 
      cardiovascular risk was higher in primary prevention patients with T2DM, but risk 
      did not interact with the treatment effect (P = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive blood 
      pressure lowering may have a similar favorable effect and appears to decrease 
      cardiovascular events in both patients with and patients without T2DM.

TI  - Diagnostics for generalized linear hierarchical models in network meta-analysis.
PG  - 333-342
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1246 [doi]
AB  - Network meta-analysis (NMA) combines direct and indirect evidence comparing more 
      than 2 treatments. Inconsistency arises when these 2 information sources differ. 
      Previous work focuses on inconsistency detection, but little has been done on how to 
      proceed after identifying inconsistency. The key issue is whether inconsistency 
      changes an NMA's substantive conclusions. In this paper, we examine such 
      discrepancies from a diagnostic point of view. Our methods seek to detect 
      influential and outlying observations in NMA at a trial-by-arm level. These 
      observations may have a large effect on the parameter estimates in NMA, or they may 
      deviate markedly from other observations. We develop formal diagnostics for a 
      Bayesian hierarchical model to check the effect of deleting any observation. 
      Diagnostics are specified for generalized linear hierarchical NMA models and 
      investigated for both published and simulated datasets. Results from our example 
      dataset using either contrast- or arm-based models and from the simulated datasets 
      indicate that the sources of inconsistency in NMA tend not to be influential, though 
      results from the example dataset suggest that they are likely to be outliers. This 
      mimics a familiar result from linear model theory, in which outliers with low 
      leverage are not influential. Future extensions include incorporating baseline 
      covariates and individual-level patient data.

TI  - Do Self-Management Interventions Work in Patients With Heart Failure? An Individual 
      Patient Data Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1189-98
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management interventions are widely implemented in the care for 
      patients with heart failure (HF). However, trials show inconsistent results, and 
      whether specific patient groups respond differently is unknown. This individual 
      patient data meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of self-management 
      interventions in patients with HF and whether subgroups of patients respond 
      differently. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic literature search identified 
      randomized trials of self-management interventions. Data from 20 studies, 
      representing 5624 patients, were included and analyzed with the use of mixed-effects 
      models and Cox proportional-hazard models, including interaction terms. 
      Self-management interventions reduced the risk of time to the combined end point of 
      HF-related hospitalization or all-cause death (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.71-0.89), time to HF-related hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.80; 
      95% CI, 0.69-0.92), and improved 12-month HF-related quality of life (standardized 
      mean difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00-0.30). Subgroup analysis revealed a protective 
      effect of self-management on the number of HF-related hospital days in patients <65 
      years of age (mean, 0.70 versus 5.35 days; interaction P=0.03). Patients without 
      depression did not show an effect of self-management on survival (hazard ratio for 
      all-cause mortality, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.69-1.06), whereas in patients with 
      moderate/severe depression, self-management reduced survival (hazard ratio, 1.39; 
      95% CI, 1.06-1.83, interaction P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that 
      self-management interventions had a beneficial effect on time to HF-related 
      hospitalization or all-cause death and HF-related hospitalization alone and elicited 
      a small increase in HF-related quality of life. The findings do not endorse limiting 
      self-management interventions to subgroups of patients with HF, but increased 
      mortality in depressed patients warrants caution in applying self-management 
      strategies in these patients.

TI  - Systematic review of studies generating individual participant data on the efficacy 
      of drugs for treating soil-transmitted helminthiases and the case for data-sharing.
PG  - e0006053
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006053 [doi]
LID - e0006053
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preventive chemotherapy and transmission control (PCT) by mass drug 
      administration is the cornerstone of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s policy to 
      control soil-transmitted helminthiases (STHs) caused by Ascaris lumbricoides 
      (roundworm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) and hookworm species (Necator americanus 
      and Ancylostama duodenale) which affect over 1 billion people globally. Despite 
      consensus that drug efficacies should be monitored for signs of decline that could 
      jeopardise the effectiveness of PCT, systematic monitoring and evaluation is seldom 
      implemented. Drug trials mostly report aggregate efficacies in groups of 
      participants, but heterogeneities in design complicate classical meta-analyses of 
      these data. Individual participant data (IPD) permit more detailed analysis of drug 
      efficacies, offering increased sensitivity to identify atypical responses 
      potentially caused by emerging drug resistance. METHODOLOGY: We performed a 
      systematic literature review to identify studies concluding after 2000 that 
      collected IPD suitable for estimating drug efficacy against STH. We included studies 
      that administered a variety of anthelmintics with follow ups less than 60 days after 
      treatment. We estimated the number of IPD and extracted cohort- and study-level 
      meta-data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We estimate that there exist individual data on 
      approximately 35,000 participants from 129 studies conducted in 39 countries, 
      including 34 out of 103 countries where PCT is recommended. We find significant 
      heterogeneity in diagnostic methods, times of outcome assessment, and the reported 
      measure of efficacy. We also quantify cohorts comprising pre-school age children, 
      pregnant women, and co-infected participants, including with HIV. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      argue that establishing a global IPD repository would improve the capacity to 
      monitor and evaluate the efficacy of anthelmintic drugs, respond to changes and 
      safeguard the ongoing effectiveness of PCT. Establishing a fair, transparent data 
      governance policy will be key for the engagement of the global STH community.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This systematic review protocol describes the methods that will be 
      used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupotomy for the treatment of lumbar 
      spinal stenosis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following electronic databases will be 
      searched until December 2018 without language or publication status restrictions: 
      five English databases, that is Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and 
      Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); three Korean 
      databases, that is Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS), 
      Research Information Service System (RISS), and Korea Citation Index (KCI); and 
      three Chinese databases, that is China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), 
      Wanfang Data, and VIP. Any clinical, randomized controlled trials using acupotomy 
      for lumbar spinal stenosis treatment will be included. Changes in the degrees of 
      pain and function will be assessed as primary outcomes. The total effective rate, 
      changes in quality of life, adverse events, and amount of rescue medication used 
      will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. Two independent researchers will perform 
      study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. If applicable, a 
      meta-analysis will be performed using RevMan version 5.3, with the results expressed 
      as risk ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. According to a 
      heterogeneity test or the number of studies included, fixed effects or random 
      effects model will be used. The risk of bias tool from the Cochrane group will be 
      used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required because individual patient data will 
      not be included in this study. The findings of this systematic review will be 
      disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication or conference presentations. 
      PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018116567.

TI  - Development of a repository of individual participant data from randomized 
      controlled trials of therapists delivered interventions for low back pain.
PG  - 815-826
LID - 10.1002/ejp.984 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of existing randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) is a promising approach to achieving sufficient statistical 
      power to identify sub-groups. We created a repository of IPD from multiple low back 
      pain (LBP) RCTs to facilitate a study of treatment moderators. Due to sparse 
      heterogeneous data, the repository needed to be robust and flexible to accommodate 
      millions of data points prior to any subsequent analysis. METHODS: We systematically 
      identified RCTs of therapist delivered intervention for inclusion to the repository. 
      Some were obtained through project publicity. We requested both individual items and 
      aggregate scores of all baseline characteristics and outcomes for all available time 
      points. The repository is made up of a hybrid database: entity-attribute-value and 
      relational database which is capable of storing sparse heterogeneous datasets. We 
      developed a bespoke software program to extract, transform and upload the shared 
      data. RESULTS: There were 20 datasets with more than 3 million data points from 9328 
      participants. All trials collected covariates and outcomes data at baseline and 
      follow-ups. The bespoke standardized repository is flexible to accommodate millions 
      of data points without compromising data integrity. Data are easily retrieved for 
      analysis using standard statistical programs. CONCLUSIONS: The bespoke hybrid 
      repository is complex to implement and to query but its flexibility in supporting 
      datasets with varying sets of responses and outcomes with different data types is a 
      worthy trade off. The large standardized LBP dataset is also an important resource 
      useable by other LBP researchers. SIGNIFICANCE: A flexible adaptive database for 
      pain studies that can easily be expanded for future researchers to map, transform 
      and upload their data in a safe and secure environment. The data are standardized 
      and harmonized which will facilitate future requests from other researchers for 
      secondary analyses.

TI  - Short-versus long-term Dual Antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent 
      implantation in women versus men: A sex-specific patient-level pooled-analysis of 
      six randomized trials.
PG  - 178-189
LID - 10.1002/ccd.26653 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether the efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) are 
      uniform between sexes is unclear. We sought to compare clinical outcomes between 
      short- (≤6 months) versus long-term (≥1 year) DAPT after drug-eluting stent (DES) 
      placement in women and men. METHODS AND RESULTS: We pooled individual patient data 
      from 6 randomized trials of DAPT (EXCELLENT, OPTIMIZE, PRODIGY, RESET, SECURITY, 
      ITALIC PLUS). The primary outcome was 1-year risk of major adverse cardiac events 
      (MACE). The main secondary outcome was 1-year risk of any bleeding. Out of the 
      11,473 randomized patients included in the pooled dataset, 3,454 (30%) were females. 
      At 1-year follow-up, women had higher risk of MACE (3.6% vs. 2.8%; P = 0.01) but 
      similar risk of bleeding (1.9% vs. 1.6%; P = 0.16) as compared with men. Compared 
      with long-term DAPT, short-term DAPT was associated with similar rates of MACE in 
      both women (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.62-1.25) and men (HR 1.25; 95% CI 0.95-1.6; P 
      interaction = 0.08)]. At 1-year follow-up, short-term DAPT was associated with lower 
      rates of bleeding as compared with long-term DAPT in both women (HR 0.84; 95% CI 
      0.51-1.37) and men (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.40-0.84; P-interaction = 0.25). The presence 
      of MVD was associated with higher MACE rates in the short-term DAPT group in women 
      (HR: 1.16; CI 0.60-2.23) and men (HR: 2.29; CI 1.22-4.29; P interaction = 0.25). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Short-term DAPT is associated with similar rates of MACE but lower risk 
      of bleeding when as compared with prolonged DAPT. There was no significant 
      difference between sexes in the population studied. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of Cerebrolysin in motor function recovery after stroke: a 
      meta-analysis of the CARS trials.
PG  - 1761-1769
LID - 10.1007/s10072-017-3037-z [doi]
AB  - This meta-analysis combines the results of two identical stroke studies (CARS-1 and 
      CARS-2) assessing efficacy of Cerebrolysin on motor recovery during early 
      rehabilitation. Cerebrolysin is a parenterally administered neuropeptide preparation 
      approved for the treatment of stroke. Both studies had a prospective, randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Treatment with 30 ml Cerebrolysin once 
      daily for 3 weeks was started 24-72 h after stroke onset. In addition, patients 
      participated in a standardized rehabilitation program for 21 days that was initiated 
      within 72 h after stroke onset. For both studies, the original analysis data were 
      used for meta-analysis (individual patient data analysis). The combination of these 
      two studies by meta-analytic procedures was pre-planned, and the methods were 
      pre-defined under blinded conditions. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney (MW) effect 
      size of the two studies on the ARAT score on day 90 indicated superiority of 
      Cerebrolysin compared with placebo (MW 0.62, P < 0.0001, Wei-Lachin pooling 
      procedure, day 90, last observation carried forward; N = 442). Also, analysis of 
      early benefit at day 14 and day 21 by means of the National Institutes of Health 
      Stroke Scale, which is regarded as most sensitive to early improvements, showed 
      statistical significance (MW 0.59, P < 0.002). The corresponding 
      number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for clinically relevant changes in early NIHSS was 7.1 
      (95% CI: 4 to 22). Cerebrolysin had a beneficial effect on motor function and 
      neurological status in early rehabilitation patients after acute ischemic stroke. 
      Safety aspects were comparable to placebo, showing a favourable benefit/risk ratio.

TI  - The Effects of Intravenous Immunoglobulins in Women with Recurrent Miscarriages: A 
      Systematic Review of Randomised Trials with Meta-Analyses and Trial Sequential 
      Analyses Including Individual Patient Data.
PG  - e0141588
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0141588 [doi]
LID - e0141588
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunological disturbances are hypothesised to play a role in recurrent 
      miscarriage (RM) and therefore intravenous immunoglubulins (IVIg) have been tested 
      in RM patients. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to investigate the benefits and 
      harms of IVIg versus placebo, no intervention, or treatment as usual in women with 
      RM. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the published literature in all relevant databases. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials investigating IVIg versus placebo, no 
      intervention, or treatment as usual in women with RM. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      We undertook meta-analyses of aggregated data and individual patient data using a 
      two-step approach, and we conducted bias domain assessments and trial sequential 
      analyses to assess the risks of systematic and random errors. MAIN RESULTS: We 
      identified 11 randomised clinical trials. No significant difference in the frequency 
      of no live birth was found when IVIg was compared with placebo or treatment as usual 
      (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75-1.12, p = 0.42). Trial sequential analysis showed that the 
      required information size of 1,008 participants was not obtained. IVIg compared with 
      placebo seems to increase the risk of adverse events. Subgroup analysis suggests 
      that women with RM after a birth (secondary RM) seemed most likely to obtain a 
      potential beneficial effect of IVIg (RR for no live birth 0.77, 95%CI 0.58-1.02, p = 
      0.06), however, trial sequential analysis showed that insufficient information is 
      presently accrued. CONCLUSION: We cannot recommend or refute IVIg in women with RM. 
      IVIg should therefore be assessed in further randomised clinical trials with 
      positive outcomes before any clinical use is considered.

COIS- Competing Interests: One of the review team members, Ole B. Christiansen (OBC), was 
      investigator in three of the randomised clinical trials on the topic and another, 
      Pia Egerup (PE), was investigator in one of the randomised clinical trials on the 
      topic. To avoid potential bias, OBC did not participate in the selecting of relevant 
      trials or in the data analyses and PE did not participate when the data of the trial 
      that she co-authored were analysed. The remaining review team members controlled 
      PE’s work. The remaining review team members (JL and CG) declare that they have no 
      competing interest. This does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies

TI  - Efficacy of drug treatment for acute mania differs across geographic regions: An 
      individual patient data meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies.
PG  - 923-32
LID - 10.1177/0269881115586938 [doi]
AB  - Given globalization trends in the conduct of clinical trials, the external validity 
      of trial results across geographic regions is questioned. The objective of this 
      study was to examine the efficacy of treatment in acute mania in bipolar disorder 
      across regions and to explain potential differences by differences in patient 
      characteristics. We performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 12 
      registration studies for the indication acute manic episode of bipolar disorder. 
      Patients (n = 3207) were classified into one of three geographic regions: Europe (n 
      = 981), USA (n = 1270), and other regions (n = 956). Primary outcome measures were 
      mean symptom change score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) from baseline to 
      endpoint and responder status (50% improvement form baseline). Effect sizes were 
      significantly smaller in the USA (g = 0.203, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      0.062-0.344; odds ratio (OR) 1.406, 95% CI 0.998-1.980) than in Europe (g = 0.476, 
      95% CI 0.200-0.672; OR 2.380, 95% CI 1.682-3.368) or other regions (g = 0.533, 95% 
      CI 0.399-0.667; OR 2.300, 95% CI 1.800-2.941). Regional differences in age, gender, 
      initial severity, body mass index, placebo response, discontinuation rate, and type 
      of compound could not explain the geographic differences in effect. Less severe 
      symptoms at baseline in the US patients did explain some of the difference in 
      responder status between patients in Europe and the USA. These findings suggest that 
      the results of studies involving patients with acute mania cannot be extrapolated 
      across geographic regions. Similar findings have been identified in schizophrenia, 
      contraceptive, and in cardiovascular trials. Therefore, this finding may indicate a 
      more general problem regarding the generalizability of pharmacological trials over 
      geographic regions.

TI  - Plasma chitotriosidase activity versus CCL18 level for assessing type I Gaucher 
      disease severity: protocol for a systematic review with meta-analysis of individual 
      participant data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage 
      disorder caused by deficiency in acid beta-glucosidase. GD exhibits a wide clinical 
      spectrum of disease severity with an unpredictable natural course. Plasma 
      chitotriosidase activity and CC chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) have been exchangeably 
      used for monitoring GD activity and response to enzyme replacement therapy in 
      conjunction with clinical assessment. Yet, a large-scale head-to-head comparison of 
      these two biomarkers is currently lacking. We propose a collaborative systematic 
      review with meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) to compare the 
      accuracy of plasma chitotriosidase activity and CCL18 in assessing type I (i.e., 
      non-neuropathic) GD severity. METHODS: Eligible studies include cross-sectional, 
      cohort, and randomized controlled studies recording both plasma chitotriosidase 
      activity and CCL18 level at baseline and/or at follow-up in consecutive children or 
      adult patients with type I GD. Pre-specified surrogate outcomes reflecting GD 
      activity include liver and spleen volume, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, 
      and symptomatic bone events with imaging confirmation. Primary studies will be 
      identified by searching Medline (1995 onwards), EMBASE (1995 onwards), and Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Electronic search will be 
      complemented by contacting research groups in order to identify unpublished relevant 
      studies. Where possible, IPD will be extracted from published articles. 
      Corresponding authors will be invited to collaborate by supplying IPD. The 
      methodological quality of retrieved studies will be appraised for each study 
      outcome, using a checklist adapted from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic 
      Accuracy Studies-2 tool. The primary outcome will be a composite of liver volume 
      >1.25 multiple of normal (MN), spleen volume >5 MN, hemoglobin concentration 
      <11 g/dL, or platelet count <100 × 10(9)/L. Effect size estimates for biomarker 
      comparative accuracy in predicting outcomes will be reported as differences in areas 
      under receiver operating characteristic curves along with 95% confidence intervals. 
      Effect size estimates will be reported as (weighted) mean differences along with 95% 
      confidence intervals for each biomarker according to outcomes. IPD meta-analysis 
      will be conducted with both one- and two-stage approaches. DISCUSSION: Valid and 
      precise accuracy estimates will be derived for CCL18 relative to plasma 
      chitotriosidase activity in discriminating patients according to GD severity.

TI  - Erlotinib-based targeted dual agent versus erlotinib alone in previously treated 
      advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled 
      trials.
PG  - 1927-1934
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of an erlotinib-based targeted dual agent with 
      erlotinib alone in previously treated patients with advanced non-small lung cancer 
      (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The PubMed and Embase databases and the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for publications between January 
      2005 and March 2016. Hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), 
      or data for calculating HRs with 95% CIs were derived. Overall survival (OS), 
      progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate 
      (DCR), and toxicity were assessed. RESULTS: Thirteen trials with a total of 4509 
      patients were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with erlotinib alone, 
      combination therapy showed no improvement in OS (HR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.89-1.02; 
      P = .132) though significantly prolonged PFS (HR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75-0.90; 
      P < .001). Combination therapy significantly increased ORR (RR = 1.32; 95% CI, 
      1.09-1.60; P = .005) and DCR (RR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17-1.36, P < .001). Sub-analysis 
      assessment failed to identify any sub-groups which could benefit from combination 
      therapy in terms of OS. Combination therapy was associated with more grade 3 or 
      higher toxic effects (RR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.22-1.95; P < .001). Patients treated with 
      combination therapy had more grade 3 or greater fatigue (RR = 1.49; 95% CI, 
      1.16-1.91; P = .002), but did not develop more diarrhea (RR = 2.02; 95% CI, 
      0.86-4.77; P = .107) or rash (RR = 1.29, 95% CI, 0.90-1.85; P = .172). This study 
      had limitations about heterogeneities among the included trials, and the analysis 
      was not based on individual patient data. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with erlotinib 
      alone, the erlotinib-based targeted dual agent showed a minimal magnitude of 
      improvement in PFS but did not improve OS. The role of erlotinib-based combinations 
      in previously treated patients with NSCLC seemed insignificant.

TI  - Upper Versus Lower Gastrointestinal Delivery for Transplantation of Fecal Microbiota 
      in Recurrent or Refractory Clostridium difficile Infection: A Collaborative Analysis 
      of Individual Patient Data From 14 Studies.
PG  - 145-150
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000511 [doi]
AB  - GOALS: The aim of this study was to compare upper gastrointestinal (UGI) versus 
      lower gastrointestinal (LGI) delivery routes of fecal microbiota transplantation 
      (FMT) for refractory or recurrent/relapsing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). 
      BACKGROUND: FMT has been proven to be a safe and highly effective therapeutic option 
      for CDI. Delivery, however, could be via the UGI or LGI routes, and it is unclear as 
      to which route provides better clinical outcome. STUDY: A systematic search for 
      studies that reported the use of FMT for CDI treatment was conducted. Individual 
      patient data that included demographic (age and sex) and clinical (route of FMT 
      delivery, CDI outcome after FMT, and follow-up time) information were obtained. 
      Kaplan-Meier cumulative hazard curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used 
      to assess clinical failure after FMT by the route of delivery. RESULTS: Data from 
      305 patients treated with FMT (208 via LGI route and 97 via UGI route) for CDI were 
      analyzed. At 30 and 90 days, the risk of clinical failure was 5.6% and 17.9% in the 
      UGI group compared with 4.9% and 8.5% in the LGI delivery route group, respectively. 
      A time-varying analysis suggested a 3-fold increase in hazard of clinical failure 
      for UGI delivery (hazard ratio, 3.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-8.93) in the 
      period after 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: FMT delivered via the LGI seems to be the most 
      effective route for the prevention of recurrence/relapse of CDI. A randomized 
      controlled trial is necessary to confirm whether FMT delivered via the LGI is indeed 
      superior to that delivered via the UGI route.

TI  - Short- versus long-term dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent 
      implantation: an individual patient data pairwise and network meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials comparing short- (≤6 months) with long-term 
      (≥1 year) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after drug-eluting stent(s) (DES) 
      placement have been insufficiently powered to detect significant differences in the 
      risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). OBJECTIVES: This study sought to 
      compare clinical outcomes between short- (≤6 months) and long-term (1 year) DAPT and 
      among 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year of DAPT post-DES placement by performing an 
      individual patient data pairwise and network meta-analysis. METHODS: Randomized 
      controlled trials comparing DAPT durations after DES placement were searched through 
      the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases and in international meeting 
      proceedings. The primary study outcome was 1-year risk of MACE (cardiac death, 
      myocardial infarction, or definite/probable stent thrombosis). RESULTS: Four trials 
      including 8,180 randomized patients were identified. At 1-year follow-up, short-term 
      DAPT was associated with similar rates of MACE (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.11; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 0.86 to 1.43; p = 0.44), but significantly lower rates of 
      bleeding (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.94; p = 0.03) versus prolonged DAPT. 
      Comparable results were apparent in the landmark period between DAPT discontinuation 
      and 1-year follow-up (for MACE: HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.89; p = 0.42) (for 
      bleeding: HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.91; p = 0.03). There were no significant 
      differences in 1-year rates of MACE among 3-month versus 1-year DAPT, 6-month versus 
      1-year DAPT, or 3-month versus 6-month DAPT. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with prolonged 
      DAPT, short-term DAPT is associated with similar rates of MACE but lower rates of 
      bleeding after DES placement.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of bone-modifying agents for the treatment of bone

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the comparative efficacy and safety of all available 
      bone-modifying agents (BMAs) for the treatment of bone metastases in patients with 
      advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). RESULTS: Three studies (259 patients) were 
      identified for the systematic review. Two studies that compared zoledronic acid with 
      placebo or no zoledronic acid showed that zoledronic acid reduced the risk of 
      skeletal-related events (SREs) by 68% (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 0.32; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-0.55). The quality of evidence was moderate. The 
      incidence of serious adverse events (AEs) was identical (80%) for both treatment 
      arms in one study and not reported in the other study. In the third study that 
      compared denosumab and zoledronic acid among patients with solid tumors or myeloma, 
      a post-hoc subgroup analysis with individual patient data (155 patients) showed an 
      HR of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.43-1.17) for SREs and a risk ratio of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.68-1.08) 
      for serious AEs for denosumab compared to zoledronic acid. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      searched the MEDLINE database, Cochrane Library, WHO International Clinical Trials 
      Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov database up to January 2017 without 
      language restriction. Only randomized controlled trials were included. When relevant 
      data were missing, we contacted the investigators of the original study. The Grading 
      of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to 
      assess the evidence certainty. CONCLUSIONS: Our moderate-quality evidence indicates 
      that zoledronic acid significantly reduces SREs risk among patients with bone 
      metastases of RCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The comparative effectiveness of percutaneous closure of patent foramen 
      ovale (PFO) plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone for cryptogenic stroke 
      is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: The authors performed the first pooled analysis of 
      individual participant data from completed randomized trials comparing PFO closure 
      versus medical therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke. METHODS: The analysis 
      included data on 2 devices (STARFlex [umbrella occluder] [NMT Medical, Inc., Boston, 
      Massachusetts] and Amplatzer PFO Occluder [disc occluder] [AGA Medical/St. Jude 
      Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota]) evaluated in 3 trials. The primary composite outcome 
      was stroke, transient ischemic attack, or death; the secondary outcome was stroke. 
      We used log-rank tests and unadjusted and covariate-adjusted Cox regression models 
      to compare device closure versus medical therapy. RESULTS: Among 2,303 patients, 
      closure was not significantly associated with the primary composite outcome. The 
      difference became significant after covariate adjustment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.68; p 
      = 0.049). For the outcome of stroke, all comparisons were statistically significant, 
      with unadjusted and adjusted HRs of 0.58 (p = 0.043) and 0.58 (p = 0.044), 
      respectively. In analyses limited to the 2 disc occluder device trials, the effect 
      of closure was not significant for the composite outcome, but was for the stroke 
      outcome (unadjusted HR: 0.39; p = 0.013). Subgroup analyses did not identify 
      significant heterogeneity of treatment effects. Atrial fibrillation was more common 
      among closure patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke, 
      closure reduced recurrent stroke and had a statistically significant effect on the 
      composite of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and death in adjusted but not 
      unadjusted analyses.

TI  - Prenatal administration of progestogens for preventing spontaneous preterm birth in 
      women with a multiple pregnancy.
PG  - CD012024
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD012024.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD012024
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple pregnancy is a strong risk factor for preterm birth, and more 
      than 50% of women with a twin pregnancy will give birth prior to 37 weeks' 
      gestation. Infants born preterm are recognised to be at increased risk of many 
      adverse health outcomes, contributing to more than half of overall perinatal 
      mortality. Progesterone is produced naturally in the body and has a role in 
      maintaining pregnancy, although it is not clear whether administering progestogens 
      to women with multiple pregnancy at high risk of early birth is effective and safe. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of progesterone administration for the 
      prevention of preterm birth in women with a multiple pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We 
      searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) 
      (1 November 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We 
      included randomised controlled trials examining the administration of a progestogen 
      by any route for the prevention of preterm birth in women with multiple pregnancy. 
      We did not include quasi-randomised or cross-over studies. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed reports identified by the search 
      for eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and graded the quality of the 
      evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 17 trials, which all compared either vaginal or 
      intramuscular (IM) progesterone with a placebo or no treatment, and involved a total 
      of 4773 women. The risk of bias for the majority of included studies was low, with 
      the exception of four studies that had inadequate blinding, or significant loss to 
      follow-up or both, or were not reported well enough for us to make a judgement. We 
      graded the evidence low to high quality, with downgrading for statistical 
      heterogeneity, design limitations in some of the studies contributing data, and 
      imprecision of the effect estimate. 1 IM progesterone versus no treatment or 
      placeboMore women delivered at less than 34 weeks' gestation in the IM progesterone 
      group compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 
      to 2.26; women = 399; studies = 2; low-quality evidence). Although the incidence of 
      perinatal death in the progesterone group was higher, there was considerable 
      uncertainty around the effect estimate and high heterogeneity between studies 
      (average RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.51; infants = 3089; studies = 6; I(2) = 71%; 
      low-quality evidence). No studies reported maternal mortality or major 
      neurodevelopmental disability at childhood follow-up.There were no clear group 
      differences found in any of the other maternal or infant outcomes (preterm birth 
      less than 37 weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; women = 2010; studies = 5; 
      high-quality evidence); preterm birth less than 28 weeks (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.75 to 
      1.55; women = 1920; studies = 5; moderate-quality evidence); infant birthweight less 
      than 2500 g (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.08; infants = 4071; studies = 5; I(2) = 76%, 
      moderate-quality evidence)). No childhood outcomes were reported in the trials. 2 
      Vaginal progesterone versus no treatment or placebo by doseThere were no clear group 
      differences in incidence of preterm birth before 34 weeks (average RR 0.83, 95% CI 
      0.63 to 1.09; women = 1727; studies = 6; I(2) = 46%; low-quality evidence). Although 
      fewer births before 34 weeks appeared to occur in the progesterone group, the CIs 
      crossed the line of no effect. Incidence of perinatal death was higher in the 
      progesterone group, although there was considerable uncertainty in the effect 
      estimate and the quality of the evidence was low for this outcome (RR 1.23, 95% CI 
      0.74 to 2.06; infants = 2287; studies = 3; low-quality evidence). No studies 
      reported maternal mortality or major neurodevelopmental disability at childhood 
      follow-up.There were no clear group differences found in any of the other maternal 
      or infant outcomes (preterm birth less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 
      to 1.06; women = 1597; studies = 6; moderate-quality evidence); preterm birth less 
      than 28 weeks (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.21; women = 1569; studies = 4; low-quality 
      evidence); infant birthweight less than 2500 g (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03; 
      infants = 3079; studies = 4; I(2) = 49%, moderate-quality evidence)). No childhood 
      outcomes were reported in the trials.For secondary outcomes, there were no clear 
      group differences found in any of the other maternal outcomes except for caesarean 
      section, where women who received vaginal progesterone did not have as many 
      caesarean sections as those in the placebo group, although the difference between 
      groups was not large (7%) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.98; women = 2143; studies = 6; 
      I(2) = 0%). There were no clear group differences found in any of the infant 
      outcomes except for mechanical ventilation, which was required by fewer infants 
      whose mothers had received the vaginal progesterone (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.77; 
      infants = 3134; studies = 5). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, for women with a 
      multiple pregnancy, the administration of progesterone (either IM or vaginal) does 
      not appear to be associated with a reduction in risk of preterm birth or improved 
      neonatal outcomes.Future research could focus on a comprehensive individual 
      participant data meta-analysis including all of the available data relating to both 
      IM and vaginal progesterone administration in women with a multiple pregnancy, 
      before considering the need to conduct trials in subgroups of high-risk women (for 
      example, women with a multiple pregnancy and a short cervical length identified on 
      ultrasound).

AB  - PURPOSE: To perform an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomized 
      controlled trials evaluating stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with or without 
      whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for patients presenting with 1 to 4 brain 
      metastases. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Three trials were identified through a literature 
      search, and IPD were obtained. Outcomes of interest were survival, local failure, 
      and distant brain failure. The treatment effect was estimated after adjustments for 
      age, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) score, number of brain metastases, and 
      treatment arm. RESULTS: A total of 364 of the pooled 389 patients met eligibility 
      criteria, of whom 51% were treated with SRS alone and 49% were treated with SRS plus 
      WBRT. For survival, age was a significant effect modifier (P=.04) favoring SRS alone 
      in patients ≤50 years of age, and no significant differences were observed in older 
      patients. Hazard ratios (HRs) for patients 35, 40, 45, and 50 years of age were 0.46 
      (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24-0.90), 0.52 (95% CI = 0.29-0.92), 0.58 (95% CI 
      = 0.35-0.95), and 0.64 (95% CI = 0.42-0.99), respectively. Patients with a single 
      metastasis had significantly better survival than those who had 2 to 4 metastases. 
      For distant brain failure, age was a significant effect modifier (P=.043), with 
      similar rates in the 2 arms for patients ≤50 of age; otherwise, the risk was reduced 
      with WBRT for patients >50 years of age. Patients with a single metastasis also had 
      a significantly lower risk of distant brain failure than patients who had 2 to 4 
      metastases. Local control significantly favored additional WBRT in all age groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: For patients ≤50 years of age, SRS alone favored survival, in addition, 
      the initial omission of WBRT did not impact distant brain relapse rates. SRS alone 
      may be the preferred treatment for this age group.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize efficacy and safety data on a new progesterone compound 
      which is available for subcutaneous administration as compared to vaginally 
      administered progesterone for luteal phase support in patients undergoing IVF 
      treatment. DESIGN: Data from two randomized phase III trials (07EU/Prg06 and 
      07USA/Prg05) performed according to GCP standards with a total sample size of 1435 
      per-protocol patients were meta-analyzed on an individual patient data level. 
      SETTING: University affiliated reproductive medicine unit. PATIENTS: Subcutaneous 
      progesterone was administered to a total of 714 subjects and vaginal progesterone 
      was administered to a total of 721 subjects who underwent fresh embryo transfer 
      after ovarian stimulation followed by IVF or ICSI. The subjects were between 18 and 
      42 years old and had a BMI <30 kg/m2. INTERVENTIONS: Subcutaneous progesterone 25 mg 
      daily vs. either progesterone vaginal gel 90 mg daily (07EU/Prg06) or 100 mg 
      intravaginal twice a day (07USA/Prg05) for luteal phase support in IVF patients. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ongoing pregnancy rate beyond 10 gestational weeks, live 
      birth rate and OHSS risk. RESULTS: The administration of subcutaneous progesterone 
      versus intra-vaginal progesterone had no impact on ongoing pregnancy likelihood (OR 
      = 0.865, 95% CI 0.694 to 1.077; P = n.s.), live birth likelihood (OR = 0.889, 95% CI 
      0.714 to 1.106; P = n.s.) or OHSS risk (OR = 0.995, 95% CI 0.565 to 1.754; P = n.s.) 
      in regression analyses accounting for clustering of patients within trials, while 
      adjusting for important confounders. Only female age and number of oocytes retrieved 
      were significant predictors of live birth likelihood and OHSS risk. CONCLUSION: No 
      statistical significant or clinical significant differences exist between 
      subcutaneous and vaginal progesterone for luteal phase support.

PG  - E1115-23
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000001580 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized controlled 
      trials of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in lumbar spinal 
      fusion. OBJECTIVE: To determine how patient characteristics impact estimates of 
      effectiveness and harms of rhBMP-2 versus iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) in lumbar 
      spinal fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patient characteristics are thought to 
      impact rates of fusion in spinal fusion surgery, but no analyses examining the 
      effect of patient characteristics on efficacy and safety of rhBMP-2 as compared with 
      ICBG have been conducted. METHODS: Using individual patient data obtained from the 
      Yale Open Data Access Project, the impact of patient characteristics on the effects 
      of rhBMP-2 on fusion, overall success, and harms were assessed using linear and 
      generalized linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: Ten industry-sponsored randomized 
      controlled trials of rhBMP-2 were included in the analysis. There is preliminary 
      support for an association between rhBMP-2 and improved outcomes for smokers 
      (P = 0.01), individuals under the age of 60 years (P < 0.01), and patients of normal 
      weight (P = 0.03), but not in patients who are nonsmokers, over the age of 60 years, 
      obese or severely obese. RhBMP-2 usage was associated with decreased harms in 
      individuals with no previous back surgeries but this was not seen in individuals 
      with a previous back surgery (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Effects of rhBMP-2 may vary 
      according to patient characteristics. Future studies of rhBMP-2 should include 
      planned subgroup analysis in patients over 60 years, smokers, patients that are 
      obese and severely obese, and individuals with previous back surgeries to better 
      identify those most likely to benefit. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1.

TI  - Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulators for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor 
      neuron disease.
PG  - CD006049
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006049.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD006049
AB  - BACKGROUND: Imbalance of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and related modulators has 
      been implicated as an important factor in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND). In this context, 
      the role and mechanism of action of gabapentin and baclofen have been extensively 
      investigated, although with conflicting results. This is the first systematic review 
      to assess clinical trials of GABA modulators for the treatment of ALS. OBJECTIVES: 
      To examine the efficacy of gabapentin, baclofen, or other GABA modulators in 
      delaying the progression of ALS, and to evaluate adverse effects of these 
      interventions SEARCH METHODS: On 16 August 2016, we searched the Cochrane 
      Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and LILACS. In addition, we checked 
      the bibliographies of the trials found in order to identify any other trials, and 
      contacted trial authors to identify relevant unpublished results or additional 
      clinical trials. On 30 August 2016, we searched two clinical trials registries. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: double-blind randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) or quasi-RCTsTypes of participants: adults with a diagnosis of probable or 
      definite ALSTypes of interventions: gabapentin, baclofen, or other GABA modulators 
      compared with placebo, no treatment, or each otherPrimary outcome: survival at one 
      year from study enrollmentSecondary outcomes: individual rate of decline of maximum 
      voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), expressed as arm megascore; rate of decline 
      of per cent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC); rate of decline of ALS Functional 
      Rating Scale (ALSFRS); health-related quality of life; survival evaluated by pooling 
      hazards; and adverse events DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review 
      authors independently checked titles and abstracts identified by the searches. The 
      review authors obtained and independently analyzed original individual participant 
      data from each included study; additional review authors and the Cochrane 
      Neuromuscular Managing Editor checked the outcome data. Two authors independently 
      assessed the risk of bias in included studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At 
      least two review authors independently checked titles and abstracts identified by 
      the searches. The review authors obtained and independently analyzed original 
      individual participant data from each included study; additional review authors and 
      the Cochrane Neuromuscular Managing Editor checked the outcome data. Two authors 
      independently assessed the risk of bias in included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We 
      identified two double-blind RCTs of gabapentin treatment in ALS for inclusion in 
      this review. We found no eligible RCTs of baclofen or other GABA modulators. The 
      selected studies were phase II and phase III trials, which lasted six and nine 
      months, respectively. They were highly comparable because both were comparisons of 
      oral gabapentin and placebo, performed by the same investigators. The trials 
      enrolled 355 participants with ALS: 80 in the gabapentin group and 72 in the placebo 
      group in the first (phase II) trial and 101 in the gabapentin group and 102 in the 
      placebo group in the second (phase III) trial. Neither trial was long enough to 
      report survival at one year, which was our primary outcome. We found little or no 
      difference in estimated one-year survival between the treated group and the placebo 
      group (78% versus 77%, P = 0.63 by log-rank test; high-quality evidence). We also 
      found little or no difference in the rate of decline of MVIC expressed as arm 
      megascore, or rate of FVC decline (high-quality evidence). One trial investigated 
      monthly decline in the ALSFRS and quality of life measured using the 12-Item Short 
      Form Survey (SF-12) and found little or no difference between groups 
      (moderate-quality evidence). The trials reported similar adverse events. Complaints 
      that were clearly elevated in those taking gabapentin, based on analyses of the 
      combined data, were light-headedness, drowsiness, and limb swelling (high-quality 
      evidence). Fatigue and falls occurred more frequently with gabapentin than with 
      placebo in one trial, but when we combined the data for fatigue from both trials, 
      there was no clear difference between the groups. We assessed the overall risk of 
      bias in the included trials as low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: According to high-quality 
      evidence, gabapentin is not effective in treating ALS. It does not extend survival, 
      slow the rate of decline of muscle strength, respiratory function and, based on 
      moderate-quality evidence, probably does not improve quality of life or slow monthly 
      decline in the ALSFRS. Other GABA modulators have not been studied in randomized 
      trials.

TI  - A model of fracture risk used to examine the link between bone mineral density and 
      the impact of different therapeutic mechanisms on fracture outcomes in patients with 
      osteoporosis.
PG  - 599-609
LID - 10.1007/s10928-017-9551-z [doi]
AB  - A hazard model of fracture was developed using individual patient data (IPD) from 
      the NHANES (2005-2008) database and summary-level data from an aggregate dataset 
      (AD). The AD was built by performing a comprehensive and systematic literature 
      search of clinical studies published from 1995 to 2015, recording fracture rate and 
      bone mineral density (BMD) for both treatment and placebo arms. The search resulted 
      in a metadata set comprised of 21 studies investigating the effects of various 
      bisphosphonates, teriparatide, denosumab, and raloxifene in 65,254 patients over a 
      cumulative 56.75 years of study. The IPD was used to augment an AD in a model-based 
      meta-analysis (MBMA) hierarchical modeling approach. The resulting model predicts 
      the probability of fracture events in patients with osteoporosis. The object of 
      model building using this approach was to promote understanding of the impact of 
      therapeutic drug effects on the probability of fracture together with, or 
      independent of their effects on BMD. Candidate models were evaluated by deviance 
      information criteria and posterior predictive check. The model with covariates for 
      lumbar spine BMD with interaction with a drug effect on BMD, and patient body mass 
      index, years post-menopause, fracture measure method (clinical or radiological) and 
      an additional drug effect outperformed those models without interaction and without 
      additional drug effects. The model quantitatively supports the widely held notion 
      that changes in bone microarchitecture, which cannot be measured by areal BMD 
      elicited by therapy contribute in a significant way to a reduction in fracture. 
      Furthermore, this model can be used to simulate fracture risk in a clinical cohort 
      similar to those contained in the MBMA.

AB  - To validate a failure-time surrogate for an established failure-time clinical 
      endpoint such as overall survival, the meta-analytic approach is commonly used. The 
      standard correlation approach considers two levels: the individual level, with 
      Kendall's τ measuring the rank correlation between the endpoints, and the trial 
      level, with the coefficient of determination R2 measuring the correlation between 
      the treatment effects on the surrogate and on the final endpoint. However, the 
      estimation of R2 is not robust with respect to the estimation error of the 
      trial-specific treatment effects. The alternative proposed in this article uses a 
      prediction error based on a measure of the weighted difference between the observed 
      treatment effect on the final endpoint and a model-based predicted effect. The 
      measures can be estimated by cross-validation within the meta-analytic setting or 
      external validation on a set of trials. Several distances are presented, with 
      varying weights, based on the standard error of the observed treatment effect and of 
      its predicted value. A simulation study was conducted under different scenarios, 
      varying the number and the size of the trials, Kendall's τ and R2 . These measures 
      have been applied to individual patient data from a meta-analysis of trials in 
      advanced/recurrent gastric cancer (20 randomized trials of chemotherapy, 4069 
      patients). The distance-based measures appeared to be robust with respect to 
      different values of simulation parameters in several scenarios (such as Kendall's τ, 
      size and number of clinical trials). The absolute prediction error can be an 
      alternative to the trial-level R2 for evaluation of candidate time-to-event 
      surrogates.

TI  - A collaborative sequential meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized 
      trials of endovascular therapy and tPA vs. tPA alone for acute ischemic stroke: 
      ThRombEctomy And tPA (TREAT) analysis: statistical analysis plan for a sequential 
      meta-analysis performed within the VISTA-Endovascular collaboration.
PG  - 136-44

AB  - RATIONALE: Endovascular treatment has been shown to restore blood flow effectively. 
      Second-generation medical devices such as stent retrievers are now showing 
      overwhelming efficacy in clinical trials, particularly in conjunction with 
      intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. AIMS AND DESIGN: This 
      statistical analysis plan utilizing a novel, sequential approach describes a 
      prospective, individual patient data analysis of endovascular therapy in conjunction 
      with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator agreed upon by the 
      Thrombectomy and Tissue Plasminogen Activator Collaborative Group. STUDY OUTCOMES: 
      This protocol will specify the primary outcome for efficacy, as 'favorable' outcome 
      defined by the ordinal distribution of the modified Rankin Scale measured at 
      three-months poststroke, but with modified Rankin Scales 5 and 6 collapsed into a 
      single category. The primary analysis will aim to answer the questions: 'what is the 
      treatment effect of endovascular therapy with intravenous recombinant tissue 
      plasminogen activator compared to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone on 
      full scale modified Rankin Scale at 3 months?' and 'to what extent do key patient 
      characteristics influence the treatment effect of endovascular therapy?'. Key 
      secondary outcomes include effect of endovascular therapy on death within 90 days; 
      analyses of modified Rankin Scale using dichotomized methods; and effects of 
      endovascular therapy on symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Several secondary 
      analyses will be considered as well as expanding patient cohorts to intravenous 
      recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-ineligible patients, should data allow. 
      DISCUSSION: This collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from 
      randomized trials of endovascular therapy vs. control in conjunction with 
      intravenous thrombolysis will demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of 
      endovascular therapy with intravenous thrombolysis as a concomitant medication.

PG  - 352-8
LID - 10.1159/000444913 [doi]
AB  - Five randomized controlled trials comparing lower (85-89%) versus higher (91-95%) 
      pulse oximeter saturation (SpO2) targets for extremely preterm infants have now been 
      reported from the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia 
      and New Zealand. These trials included more than 4,800 infants, and they provide 
      robust evidence to permit comparison of these target ranges and consider the next 
      steps for clinicians and researchers. The lower SpO2 range was associated with a 
      significant increase in the risk of death. There was no significant difference 
      between the two target ranges in the rate of disability at 18-24 months, including 
      blindness. A significant difference between groups in the risk of the composite 
      primary outcome of death or disability in favour of the higher SpO2 range was mainly 
      attributable to the difference between groups in the risk of death. The lower target 
      range did not reduce bronchopulmonary dysplasia or severe visual impairment, but it 
      did increase the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgery or causing 
      death. The trials provide no reason to prefer SpO2 targets below 90% and indicate 
      the importance of more trials to see if a further survival advantage can be 
      identified. The safety of targets above 95% has not been evaluated. The five trials 
      were designed to be similar to facilitate an individual patient data meta-analysis, 
      and this Neonatal Oxygen Prospective Meta-Analysis (NeOProM) may provide further 
      insights.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The authors undertook a patient-level meta-analysis to compare long-term 
      outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus percutaneous coronary 
      intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) in 3,280 patients with left main 
      or multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). BACKGROUND: The relative efficacy and 
      safety of CABG versus PCI with DES for left main or multivessel CAD remain 
      controversial. METHODS: Data were pooled from the BEST (Randomized Comparison of 
      Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery and Everolimus Eluting Stent Implantation in the 
      Treatment of Patients With Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease), PRECOMBAT (Premier 
      of Randomized Comparison of Bypass Surgery vs. Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting 
      Stent in Patients With Left Main Coronary Artery Disease), and SYNTAX (Synergy 
      Between PCI With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) trials. The primary outcome was a 
      composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. RESULTS: The median 
      follow-up was 60 months, and follow-up was completed for 96.2% of patients. The rate 
      of primary outcome was significantly lower with CABG than with PCI (13.0% vs. 16.0%; 
      hazard ratio [HR]: 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69 to 1.00; p = 0.046). The 
      difference was mainly driven by reduction in myocardial infarction (HR: 0.46; 95% 
      CI: 0.33 to 0.64; p < 0.001). There was significant interaction between treatment 
      effect and types of CAD, showing CABG to be superior compared with PCI with DES in 
      patients with multivessel CAD (p = 0.001), but no between-group difference in those 
      with left main CAD (p = 0.427). The rates for all-cause death and stroke were 
      similar between the 2 groups. By contrast, the need for repeat revascularization was 
      significantly lower in the CABG group compared with the PCI group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      CABG, as compared with PCI with DES, reduced long-term rates of the composite of 
      all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in patients with left main or 
      multivessel CAD. The advantage of CABG over PCI with DES was particularly pronounced 
      in those with multivessel CAD.

AB  - We examined the role of placebo response in acute mania trials. Specifically, 
      whether placebo response: (1) predicts treatment effect, (2) can be predicted by 
      patient and study characteristics, and (3) can be predicted by a parsimonious model. 
      We performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 10 registration studies 
      (n=1019) for the indication acute manic episode of bipolar disorder. We assessed the 
      effect of 14 determinants on placebo response. Primary outcome measures were mean 
      symptom change score (MCS) on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and response rate 
      (RR), defined as ≥ 50% YMRS symptom improvement from baseline to endpoint. The 
      overall placebo response was 8.5 points improvement on the YMRS (=27.9%) with a RR 
      of 32.8%. Placebo response was significantly associated with the overall treatment 
      response. Five determinants significantly (p<0.05) predicted the placebo response. 
      The multivariate prediction model, which consisted of baseline severity, psychotic 
      features at baseline, number of geographic regions, and region, explained 10.4% and 
      5.5% of the variance in MSC and RR, respectively. Our findings showed that the 
      placebo response in efficacy trials of antipsychotics for acute mania is substantial 
      and an important determinant of treatment effect. Placebo response is influenced by 
      patient characteristics (illness severity and presence of psychotic features) and by 
      study characteristics (study year, number of geographic regions and region). 
      However, the prediction model could only explain the placebo response to a limited 
      extent. Therefore, limiting trials to certain patients in certain geographic regions 
      seems not a viable strategy to improve assay sensitivity.

TI  - Melancholic and atypical depression as predictor and moderator of outcome in 
      cognitive behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy for adult depression.
PG  - 246-256
LID - 10.1002/da.22580 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Melancholic and atypical depression are widely thought to moderate or 
      predict outcome of pharmacological and psychological treatments of adult depression, 
      but that has not yet been established. This study uses the data from four earlier 
      trials comparing cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) versus antidepressant medications 
      (ADMs; and pill placebo when available) to examine the extent to which melancholic 
      and atypical depression moderate or predict outcome in an "individual patient data" 
      meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for studies directly 
      comparing CBT versus ADM, contacted the researchers, integrated the resulting 
      datasets from these studies into one big dataset, and selected the studies that 
      included melancholic or atypical depressive subtyping according to DSM-IV criteria 
      at baseline (n = 4, with 805 patients). After multiple imputation of missing data at 
      posttest, mixed models were used to conduct the main analyses. RESULTS: In none of 
      the analyses was melancholic or atypical depression found to significantly moderate 
      outcome (indicating a better or worse outcome of these patients in CBT compared to 
      ADM; i.e., an interaction), predict outcome independent of treatment group (i.e., a 
      main effect), or predict outcome within a given modality. The outcome differences 
      between patients with melancholia or atypical depression versus those without were 
      consistently very small (all effect sizes g < 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: We found no 
      indication that melancholic or atypical depressions are significant or relevant 
      moderators or predictors of outcome of CBT and ADM.

TI  - Outcome after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in young breast cancer patients: a pooled 
      analysis of individual patient data from eight prospectively randomized controlled 
      trials.
PG  - 377-87
LID - 10.1007/s10549-015-3479-z [doi]
AB  - Young women with breast cancer (BC) have a worse survival partly due to more 
      aggressive tumor characteristics; however, their response to chemotherapy seems 
      better. We investigated to what extent the prognostic factor pathological complete 
      remission (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is applicable to young women. 8949 
      patients with primary BC and follow-up from eight German neoadjuvant trials were 
      included. A subgroup of 1453 patients <40 years was compared with women aged 40-49 
      and ≥50 years regarding pCR (ypT0 ypN0), as well as disease free survival (DFS), 
      local recurrence free survival (LRFS), distant disease free survival (DDFS), and 
      overall survival (OS) overall, according to pCR status and subtypes defined by 
      hormone-receptor (HR) status and HER2. pCR was strongly associated with age without 
      a clear age cut-off. The pCR rate was significantly higher in the young compared 
      with other age groups (20.9 vs. 17.7 vs. 13.7 %; p < 0.001). This difference was 
      confined to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HR +/HER2-. DFS, DDFS, LRFS, 
      and OS were significantly worse for young women. Age was independently prognostic 
      for survival in HR +/HER2-, with women <40 years without pCR having a worse DFS 
      compared to their counterparts with pCR. Young women are more likely to achieve pCR 
      after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, especially in HR +/HER2- and TNBC. Age is not an 
      important prognostic factor in TNBC and HR-/HER2 + but is in HR +/HER2-. Young women 
      with a luminal-like BC seem to benefit more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy than older 
      women, which needs to be taken into account.

LID - e1001778
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies of a putative association between hormonal 
      contraception (HC) and HIV acquisition have produced conflicting results. We 
      conducted an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies from 
      sub-Saharan Africa to compare the incidence of HIV infection in women using combined 
      oral contraceptives (COCs) or the injectable progestins depot-medroxyprogesterone 
      acetate (DMPA) or norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) with women not using HC. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: Eligible studies measured HC exposure and incident HIV infection 
      prospectively using standardized measures, enrolled women aged 15-49 y, recorded ≥15 
      incident HIV infections, and measured prespecified covariates. Our primary analysis 
      estimated the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) using two-stage random effects 
      meta-analysis, controlling for region, marital status, age, number of sex partners, 
      and condom use. We included 18 studies, including 37,124 women (43,613 woman-years) 
      and 1,830 incident HIV infections. Relative to no HC use, the aHR for HIV 
      acquisition was 1.50 (95% CI 1.24-1.83) for DMPA use, 1.24 (95% CI 0.84-1.82) for 
      NET-EN use, and 1.03 (95% CI 0.88-1.20) for COC use. Between-study heterogeneity was 
      mild (I(2) < 50%). DMPA use was associated with increased HIV acquisition compared 
      with COC use (aHR 1.43, 95% CI 1.23-1.67) and NET-EN use (aHR 1.32, 95% CI 
      1.08-1.61). Effect estimates were attenuated for studies at lower risk of 
      methodological bias (compared with no HC use, aHR for DMPA use 1.22, 95% CI 
      0.99-1.50; for NET-EN use 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.96; and for COC use 0.91, 95% CI 
      0.73-1.41) compared to those at higher risk of bias (p(interaction) = 0.003). 
      Neither age nor herpes simplex virus type 2 infection status modified the HC-HIV 
      relationship. CONCLUSIONS: This IPD meta-analysis found no evidence that COC or 
      NET-EN use increases women's risk of HIV but adds to the evidence that DMPA may 
      increase HIV risk, underscoring the need for additional safe and effective 
      contraceptive options for women at high HIV risk. A randomized controlled trial 
      would provide more definitive evidence about the effects of hormonal contraception, 
      particularly DMPA, on HIV risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of β blockers in a broad age 
      range of women and men with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) by 
      pooling individual patient data from placebo controlled randomised trials. DESIGN: 
      Prospectively designed meta-analysis of individual patient data from patients aged 
      40-85 in sinus rhythm at baseline, with left ventricular ejection fraction <0.45. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 13,833 patients from 11 trials; median age 64; 24% women. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: The primary outcome was all cause mortality; the major secondary outcome 
      was admission to hospital for heart failure. Analysis was by intention to treat with 
      an adjusted one stage Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Compared with 
      placebo, β blockers were effective in reducing mortality across all ages: hazard 
      ratios were 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.83) for the first quarter of age 
      distribution (median age 50); 0.71 (0.58 to 0.87) for the second quarter (median age 
      60); 0.65 (0.53 to 0.78) for the third quarter (median age 68); and 0.77 (0.64 to 
      0.92) for the fourth quarter (median age 75). There was no significant interaction 
      when age was modelled continuously (P=0.1), and the absolute reduction in mortality 
      was 4.3% over a median follow-up of 1.3 years (number needed to treat 23). Admission 
      to hospital for heart failure was significantly reduced by β blockers, although this 
      effect was attenuated at older ages (interaction P=0.05). There was no evidence of 
      an interaction between treatment effect and sex in any age group. Drug 
      discontinuation was similar regardless of treatment allocation, age, or sex (14.4% 
      in those give β blockers, 15.6% in those receiving placebo). CONCLUSION: 
      Irrespective of age or sex, patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm should receive β 
      blockers to reduce the risk of death and admission to hospital.Registration PROSPERO

TI  - GetReal: from efficacy in clinical trials to relative effectiveness in the real 
      world.
PG  - 278-81
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1207 [doi]
AB  - The GetReal consortium ("incorporating real-life data into drug development") 
      addresses the efficacy-effectiveness gap that opens between the data from 
      well-controlled randomized trials in selected patient groups submitted to regulators 
      and the real-world evidence on effectiveness and safety of drugs required by 
      decision makers. Workpackage 4 of GetReal develops evidence synthesis and modelling 
      approaches to generate the real-world evidence. In this commentary, we discuss how 
      questions change when moving from the well-controlled randomized trial setting to 
      real-life medical practice, the evidence required to answer these questions, the 
      populations to which estimates will be applicable to and the methods and data 
      sources used to produce these estimates. We then introduce the methodological 
      reviews written by GetReal authors and published in Research Synthesis Methods on 
      network meta-analysis, individual patient data meta-analysis and mathematical 
      modelling to predict drug effectiveness. The critical reviews of key methods are a 
      good starting point for the ambitious programme of work GetReal has embarked on. The 
      different strands of work under way in GetReal have great potential to contribute to 
      making clinical trials research as relevant as it can be to patients, caregivers and 
      policy makers. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Telemonitoring Versus Usual Care for Heart Failure: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

LID - S1071-9164(17)31211-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.cardfail.2017.09.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of telemonitoring (TM) in 
      the management of patients with heart failure (HF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched 
      Ovid-Medline, Ovid-Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials 
      published through May 2016. Outcomes of interest included clinical effectiveness 
      (mortality, hospitalization, and emergency department visits) and patient-reported 
      outcomes. TM was defined as the transmission of individual biologic data, such as 
      weight, blood pressure, and heart rate. Thirty-seven randomized controlled trials 
      (9582 patients) of TM met the inclusion criteria: 24 studies on all-cause mortality, 
      17 studies on all-cause hospitalization, 12 studies on HF-related hospitalization, 
      and 5 studies on HF-related mortality. The risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio 
      [RR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.94) and HF-related mortality (RR 
      0.68, 95% CI 0.50-0.91) were significantly lower in the TM group than in the usual 
      care group. TM showed a significant benefit when ≥3 biologic data are transmitted or 
      when transmission occurred daily. TM also reduced mortality risk in studies that 
      monitored patients' symptoms, medication adherence, or prescription changes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: TM intervention reduces the mortality risk in patients with HF, and 
      intensive monitoring with more frequent transmissions of patient data increases its 
      effectiveness.

TI  - Low-dose aspirin as an adjuvant treatment for venous leg ulceration: study protocol 
      for a randomized controlled trial (Aspirin4VLU).
PG  - 669-79
LID - 10.1111/jan.12864 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of low-dose aspirin on venous 
      leg ulcer healing when used in addition to compression. BACKGROUND: The mainstay of 
      treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression therapy and there are few adjuvant 
      treatments to accelerate healing. DESIGN: Pragmatic, community-based, double-blind, 
      randomized trial. METHODS: Participants with venous leg ulcers will receive either 
      150 mg aspirin or placebo daily for up to 24 weeks. Participants will receive 
      background treatment with compression therapy (system of choice guided by 
      participant and/or clinical preference) delivered through district nursing services. 
      The primary outcome will be time-to-healing. Secondary outcomes will include 
      proportion healed at 24 weeks, change in ulcer area, change in health-related 
      quality of life, adherence, efficacy of blinding and adverse events. The trial was 
      funded in June 2014. DISCUSSION: The trial commenced in March 2015 and is 
      successfully recruiting. The trial is one of three trials that will contribute to an 
      individual participant data meta-analysis to be undertaken at the York Trials 
      Centre. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered 5 June 2014 ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02158806.

TI  - [Dispatchers' impressions and actual quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation during 
      telephone-assisted bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a pooled analysis of 94 
      simulated, manikin-based scenarios].
PG  - 11-17
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The quality of telephone-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
      needs improvement. This study investigates whether a dispatchers' perception is an 
      adequate measure of the actual quality of CPR provided by laypersons. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Individual participant data from 3 randomized simulation trials, with 
      identical methodology but different interventions, were combined for this analysis. 
      Professional dispatchers gave telephone assistance to laypersons, who each provided 
      10 minutes of CPR on a manikin. Dispatchers were requested to classify the quality 
      of providers' CPR as adequate or inadequate. Based on actual readings from manikins 
      we classified providers' performance as adequate at 5-6 cm for depth and 100-120 
      compressions per minute (cpm) for rate. We calculated metrics of dispatcher 
      accuracy. RESULTS: Six dispatchers rated the performance of 94 laypersons (38 women 
      [42%]) with a mean (SD) age of 37 (14) years. In 905 analyzed minutes of 
      telephone-assisted CPR, the mean compression depth and rate was 41 (13) mm and 98 
      (24) cpm, respectively. Analysis of dispatchers' diagnostic test accuracy for 
      adequate compression depth yielded a sensitivity of 65% (95 CI 36%-95%) and 
      specificity of 42% (95% CI, 32%-53%). Analysis of their assessment of adequate 
      compression rate yielded a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 64%-86%) and specificity of 
      42% (95% CI, 32%-52%). Although dispatchers always underestimated the actual values 
      of CPR parameters, the female dispatchers evaluations were less inaccurate than the 
      evaluations of make dispatchers; the dispatchers overall (males and females 
      together) underestimated the adequacy of female laypersons' CPR performance to a 
      greater degree than female dispatchers did. CONCLUSION: The ability of dispatchers 
      to estimate the quality of telephone-assisted CPR is limited. Dispatchers estimates 
      of CPR adequacy needs to be studied further in order to find ways that 
      telephone-assisted CPR might be improved.

TI  - Targeting aspirin in acute disabling ischemic stroke: an individual patient data 
      meta-analysis of three large randomized trials.
PG  - 1024-30
LID - 10.1111/ijs.12487 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspirin is of moderate overall benefit for patients with acute disabling 
      ischemic stroke. It is unclear whether functional outcome could be improved after 
      stroke by targeting aspirin to patients with a high risk of recurrent thrombosis or 
      a low risk of haemorrhage. AIMS: We aimed to determine whether patients at higher 
      risk of thrombotic events or poor functional outcome, or lower risk of major 
      haemorrhage had a greater absolute risk reduction of poor functional outcome with 
      aspirin than the average patient. METHODS: We used data on individual ischemic 
      stroke patients from three large trials of aspirin vs. placebo in acute ischemic 
      stroke: the first International Stroke Trial (n = 18,372), the Chinese Acute Stroke 
      Trial (n = 20,172) and the Multicentre Acute Stroke Trial (n = 622). We developed 
      and evaluated clinical prediction models for the following: early thrombotic events 
      (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
      embolism); early haemorrhagic events (significant intracranial haemorrhage, major 
      extracranial haemorrhage, or haemorrhagic transformation of an infarct); and late 
      poor functional outcome. We calculated the absolute risk reduction of poor 
      functional outcome (death or dependence) at final follow-up in: quartiles of early 
      thrombotic risk; quartiles of early haemorrhagic risk; and deciles of poor 
      functional outcome risk. RESULTS: Ischemic stroke patients who were older, had lower 
      blood pressure, computerized tomography evidence of infarct or more severe deficits 
      due to stroke had increased risk of thrombotic and haemorrhagic events and poor 
      functional outcome. Prediction models built with all baseline variables (including 
      onset to treatment time) discriminated weakly between patients with and without 
      recurrent thrombotic events (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      0·56, 95% CI:0·53-0·59) and haemorrhagic events (0·57, 0·52-0·64), though well 
      between patients with and without poor functional outcome (0·77, 0·76-0·78) in the 
      International Stroke Trial. We found no evidence that the net benefit of aspirin 
      increased with increasing risk of thrombosis, haemorrhage or poor functional outcome 
      in all three trials. CONCLUSIONS: Using simple clinical variables to target aspirin 
      to patients after acute disabling stroke by risk of thrombosis, haemorrhage or poor 
      functional outcome does not lead to greater net clinical benefit. We suggest future 
      risk stratification schemes include new risk factors for thrombosis and intracranial 
      haemorrhage.

      patient data.
PG  - 47

LID - 47
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several indirect comparison methods, including network meta-analyses 
      (NMAs), using individual patient data (IPD) have been developed to synthesize 
      evidence from a network of trials. Although IPD indirect comparisons are published 
      with increasing frequency in health care literature, there is no guidance on 
      selecting the appropriate methodology and on reporting the methods and results. 
      METHODS: In this paper we examine the methods and reporting of indirect comparison 
      methods using IPD. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL 
      from inception until October 2014. We included published and unpublished studies 
      reporting a method, application, or review of indirect comparisons using IPD and at 
      least three interventions. RESULTS: We identified 37 papers, including a total of 33 
      empirical networks. Of these, only 9 (27 %) IPD-NMAs reported the existence of a 
      study protocol, whereas 3 (9 %) studies mentioned that protocols existed without 
      providing a reference. The 33 empirical networks included 24 (73 %) IPD-NMAs and 9 
      (27 %) matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs). Of the 21 (64 %) networks 
      with at least one closed loop, 19 (90 %) were IPD-NMAs, 13 (68 %) of which evaluated 
      the prerequisite consistency assumption, and only 5 (38 %) of the 13 IPD-NMAs used 
      statistical approaches. The median number of trials included per network was 10 (IQR 
      4-19) (IPD-NMA: 15 [IQR 8-20]; MAIC: 2 [IQR 3-5]), and the median number of IPD 
      trials included in a network was 3 (IQR 1-9) (IPD-NMA: 6 [IQR 2-11]; MAIC: 2 [IQR 
      1-2]). Half of the networks (17; 52 %) applied Bayesian hierarchical models (14 
      one-stage, 1 two-stage, 1 used IPD as an informative prior, 1 unclear-stage), 
      including either IPD alone or with aggregated data (AD). Models for dichotomous and 
      continuous outcomes were available (IPD alone or combined with AD), as were models 
      for time-to-event data (IPD combined with AD). CONCLUSIONS: One in three indirect 
      comparison methods modeling IPD adjusted results from different trials to estimate 
      effects as if they had come from the same, randomized, population. Key 
      methodological and reporting elements (e.g., evaluation of consistency, existence of 
      study protocol) were often missing from an indirect comparison paper.

TI  - Multivariate Meta-Analysis of Heterogeneous Studies Using Only Summary Statistics: 
      Efficiency and Robustness.
PG  - 326-340
AB  - Meta-analysis has been widely used to synthesize evidence from multiple studies for 
      common hypotheses or parameters of interest. However, it has not yet been fully 
      developed for incorporating heterogeneous studies, which arise often in applications 
      due to different study designs, populations or outcomes. For heterogeneous studies, 
      the parameter of interest may not be estimable for certain studies, and in such a 
      case, these studies are typically excluded from conventional meta-analysis. The 
      exclusion of part of the studies can lead to a non-negligible loss of information. 
      This paper introduces a metaanalysis for heterogeneous studies by combining the 
      confidence density functions derived from the summary statistics of individual 
      studies, hence referred to as the CD approach. It includes all the studies in the 
      analysis and makes use of all information, direct as well as indirect. Under a 
      general likelihood inference framework, this new approach is shown to have several 
      desirable properties, including: i) it is asymptotically as efficient as the maximum 
      likelihood approach using individual participant data (IPD) from all studies; ii) 
      unlike the IPD analysis, it suffices to use summary statistics to carry out the CD 
      approach. Individual-level data are not required; and iii) it is robust against 
      misspecification of the working covariance structure of the parameter estimates. 
      Besides its own theoretical significance, the last property also substantially 
      broadens the applicability of the CD approach. All the properties of the CD approach 
      are further confirmed by data simulated from a randomized clinical trials setting as 
      well as by real data on aircraft landing performance. Overall, one obtains an 
      unifying approach for combining summary statistics, subsuming many of the existing 
      meta-analysis methods as special cases.

TI  - Statin pretreatment and risk of in-hospital atrial fibrillation among patients 
      undergoing cardiac surgery: a collaborative meta-analysis of 11 randomized 
      controlled trials.
PG  - 855-63
LID - 10.1093/europace/euv001 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Statin pretreatment in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is understood to 
      prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF). However, this is based on 
      observational and limited randomized trial evidence, resulting in uncertainty about 
      any genuine anti-arrhythmic benefits of these agents in this setting. We therefore 
      aimed to quantify precisely the association between statin pretreatment and 
      postoperative AF among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 
      detailed search of MEDLINE and PubMed databases (1st January 1996 to 31st July 2012) 
      was conducted, followed by a review of the reference lists of published studies and 
      correspondence with trial investigators to obtain individual-participant data for 
      meta-analysis. Evidence was combined across prospective, randomized clinical trials 
      that compared the risk of postoperative AF among individuals randomized to statin 
      pretreatment or placebo/control medication before elective cardiac surgery. 
      Postoperative AF was defined as episodes of AF lasting ≥5 min. Overall, 1105 
      participants from 11 trials were included; of them, 552 received statin therapy 
      preoperatively. Postoperative AF occurred in 19% of these participants when compared 
      with 36% of those not treated with statins (odds ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 
      0.31-0.54, P < 0.00001, using a random-effects model). Atrial fibrillation 
      prevention by statin pretreatment was consistent across different subgroups. 
      CONCLUSION: Short-term statin pretreatment may reduce the risk of postoperative AF 
      among patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

TI  - The FOCUS, AFFINITY and EFFECTS trials studying the effect(s) of fluoxetine in 
      patients with a recent stroke: a study protocol for three multicentre randomised 
      controlled trials.
PG  - 369
LID - 10.1186/s13063-015-0864-1 [doi]
LID - 369
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several small trials have suggested that fluoxetine improves 
      neurological recovery from stroke. FOCUS, AFFINITY and EFFECTS are a family of 
      investigator-led, multicentre, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled trials 
      that aim to determine whether routine administration of fluoxetine (20 mg daily) for 
      6 months after acute stroke improves patients' functional outcome. METHODS/DESIGN: 
      The three trial investigator teams have collaboratively developed a core protocol. 
      Minor variations have been tailored to the national setting in the UK (FOCUS), 
      Australia and New Zealand (AFFINITY) and Sweden (EFFECTS). Each trial is run and 
      funded independently and will report its own results. A prospectively planned 
      individual patient data meta-analysis of all three trials will subsequently provide 
      the most precise estimate of the overall effect of fluoxetine after stroke and 
      establish whether any effects differ between trials and subgroups of patients. The 
      trials include patients ≥18 years old with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, 
      persisting focal neurological deficits at randomisation between 2 and 15 days after 
      stroke onset. Patients are randomised centrally via web-based randomisation systems 
      using a common minimisation algorithm. Patients are allocated fluoxetine 20 mg once 
      daily or matching placebo capsules for 6 months. Our primary outcome measure is the 
      modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include the Stroke 
      Impact Scale, EuroQol (EQ5D-5 L), the vitality subscale of the Short-Form 36, 
      diagnosis of depression, adherence to medication, adverse events and resource use. 
      Outcomes are collected at 6 and 12 months. The methods of collecting these data are 
      tailored to the national setting. If FOCUS, AFFINITY and EFFECTS combined enrol 6000 
      participants as planned, they would have 90 % power (alpha 5 %) to detect a common 
      odds ratio of 1.16, equivalent to a 3.7 % absolute difference in percentage with mRS 
      0-2 (44.0 % to 47.7 %). This is based on an ordinal analysis of mRS adjusted for 
      baseline variables included in the minimisation algorithm. DISCUSSION: If fluoxetine 
      is safe and effective in promoting functional recovery, it could be rapidly, widely 
      and affordably implemented in routine clinical practice and reduce the burden of 
      disability due to stroke. FOCUS: ISRCTN83290762 (23/05/2012), AFFINITY: 
      ACTRN12611000774921 (22/07/2011). EFFECTS: ISRCTN13020412 (19/12/2014).

PG  - 294-306
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000000547 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of urinary alkalinization in cardiac surgery patients at risk 
      of acute kidney injury (AKI) is controversial and trial findings conflicting. 
      Accordingly, the authors performed a prospectively planned individual patient data 
      meta-analysis of the double-blind randomized trials in this field. METHODS: The 
      authors studied 877 patients from three double-blind, randomized controlled trials 
      enrolled to receive either 24 h of intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate or 
      sodium chloride. The primary outcome measure was a postoperative increase in serum 
      creatinine concentration of greater than 25% or 0.5 mg/dl (> 44 μM/L) within the 
      first five postoperative days. Secondary outcomes included the raw change in serum 
      creatinine, greater than 50% and greater than 100% rises in serum creatinine, 
      developing AKI (Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria), initiation of renal 
      replacement therapy, morbidity, and mortality. RESULTS: Patients were similar in 
      demographics, comorbidities, and cardiac procedures. Sodium bicarbonate increased 
      plasma bicarbonate (P < 0.001) and urine pH (P < 0.001). There were no differences 
      in the development of the primary outcome (Bicarbonate 45% [39-51%] vs. Saline 42% 
      [36-48%], P = 0.29). This result remained unchanged when controlling for study and 
      covariates (odds ratio [OR], 99% confidence interval [CI]: Bicarbonate vs. Control, 
      1.11 [0.77-1.60], P = 0.45). There was, however, a significant study-adjusted 
      benefit in elective coronary artery bypass surgery patients in terms of renal 
      replacement therapy (Bicarbonate vs. Control, OR: 0.38 [99% CI: 0.25-0.58], P < 
      0.0001) and the development of an Acute Kidney Injury Network grade = 3 (Bicarbonate 
      vs. Control, OR: 0.45 [99% CI: 0.43-0.48], P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Urinary 
      alkalinization using sodium bicarbonate infusion is not associated with an overall 
      lower incidence of AKI; however, it reduces severe AKI and need for renal 
      replacement therapy in elective coronary artery bypass patients.

      pivotal for mortality reduction. Starting a targeted antifungal therapy after 
      culture positivity and fungi identification requires a long time. Therefore, 
      alternative strategies (globally defined as 'untargeted antifungal treatments') for 
      antifungal therapy institution in patients without proven microbiological evidence 
      of fungal infections have been discussed by international guidelines. This review 
      was originally published in 2006 and updated in 2016. This updated review provides 
      additional evidence for the clinician dealing with suspicion of fungal infection in 
      critically ill, non-neutropenic patients, taking into account recent findings in 
      this field. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of untargeted treatment with any 
      antifungal drug (either systemic or nonabsorbable) compared to placebo or no 
      antifungal or any other antifungal drug (either systemic or nonabsorbable) in 
      non-neutropenic, critically ill adults and children. We assessed effectiveness in 
      terms of total (all-cause) mortality and incidence of proven invasive fungal 
      infections as primary outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases 
      to February 2015: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 
      MEDLINE (OVID), and EMBASE (OVID). We also searched reference lists of identified 
      studies and major reviews, abstracts of conference proceedings, scientific meetings 
      and clinical trials registries. We contacted experts in the field, study authors and 
      pharmaceutical companies as part of the search strategy. SELECTION CRITERIA: We 
      included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (irrespective of language or 
      publication status) comparing the use of untargeted treatment with any antifungal 
      drug (either systemic or nonabsorbable) to placebo, no antifungal, or another 
      antifungal agent in non-neutropenic critically ill participants. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Three authors independently applied selection criteria, extracted data and 
      assessed the risk of bias. We resolved any discrepancies by discussion. We 
      synthesized data using the random-effects model and expressed the results as risk 
      ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed overall evidence quality 
      using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 studies (total of 2761 
      participants). Of those 22 studies, 12 were included in the original published 
      review and 10 were newly identified. Eleven trials compared the use of fluconazole 
      to placebo or no antifungal treatment. Three trials compared ketoconazole versus 
      placebo. One trial compared anidulafungin with placebo. One trial compared 
      caspofungin to placebo. Two trials compared micafungin to placebo. One trial 
      compared amphotericin B to placebo. Two trials compared nystatin to placebo and one 
      trial compared the effect of clotrimazole, ketoconazole, nystatin and no treatment. 
      We found two new ongoing studies and four new studies awaiting classification. The 
      RCTs included participants of both genders with wide age range, severity of critical 
      illness and clinical characteristics. Funding sources from pharmaceutical companies 
      were reported in 11 trials and one trial reported funding from a government agency. 
      Most of the studies had an overall unclear risk of bias for key domains of this 
      review (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome 
      data). Two studies had a high risk of bias for key domains. Regarding the other 
      domains (blinding of participants and personnel, outcome assessment, selective 
      reporting, other bias), most of the studies had a low or unclear risk but four 
      studies had a high risk of bias.There was moderate grade evidence that untargeted 
      antifungal treatment did not significantly reduce or increase total (all-cause) 
      mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09, P value = 0.36; participants = 2374; 
      studies = 19). With regard to the outcome of proven invasive fungal infection, there 
      was low grade evidence that untargeted antifungal treatment significantly reduced 
      the risk (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.83, P value = 0.0001; participants = 2024; 
      studies = 17). The risk of fungal colonization was significantly reduced (RR 0.71, 
      95% CI 0.52 to 0.97, P value = 0.03; participants = 1030; studies = 12) but the 
      quality of evidence was low. There was no difference in the risk of developing 
      superficial fungal infection (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.29, P value = 0.24; 
      participants = 662; studies = 5; low grade of evidence) or in adverse events 
      requiring cessation of treatment between the untargeted treatment group and the 
      other group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.27, P value = 0.51; participants = 1691; 
      studies = 11; low quality of evidence). The quality of evidence for the outcome of 
      total (all-cause) mortality was moderate due to limitations in study design. The 
      quality of evidence for the outcome of invasive fungal infection, superficial fungal 
      infection, fungal colonization and adverse events requiring cessation of therapy was 
      low due to limitations in study design, non-optimal total population size, risk of 
      publication bias, and heterogeneity across studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is 
      moderate quality evidence that the use of untargeted antifungal treatment is not 
      associated with a significant reduction in total (all-cause) mortality among 
      critically ill, non-neutropenic adults and children compared to no antifungal 
      treatment or placebo. The untargeted antifungal treatment may be associated with a 
      reduction of invasive fungal infections but the quality of evidence is low, and both 
      the heterogeneity and risk of publication bias is high.Further high-quality RCTs are 
      needed to improve the strength of the evidence, especially for more recent and less 
      studied drugs (e.g. echinocandins). Future trials should adopt standardized 
      definitions for microbiological outcomes (e.g. invasive fungal infection, 
      colonization) to reduce heterogeneity. Emergence of resistance to antifungal drugs 
      should be considered as outcome in studies investigating the effects of untargeted 
      antifungal treatment to balance risks and benefit.

AB  - If IPD is available for some or all trials in a network meta-analysis (NMA), then 
      incorporating this IPD into an NMA is routinely considered to be preferable. 
      However, the situation often arises where a researcher has IPD for trials concerning 
      a particular treatment (eg, from a sponsor) but none for other trials. Therefore, 
      one can reweight the IPD so that the covariate characteristics in the IPD trials 
      match that of the aggregate data (AgD) trials, using a matching-adjusted indirect 
      comparison (MAIC). We assess the impact of using the reweighted aggregated data, 
      obtained by the MAIC, in a Bayesian NMA for a connected treatment network. We apply 
      this method to a network of multiple myeloma treatments in newly diagnosed patients 
      (ndMM), where the outcome is progression free survival. We investigate the 
      reliability of the methods and results through a simulation study. The ndMM network 
      consists of three IPD studies comparing lenalidomide to placebo (Len-Placebo), one 
      AgD study comparing Len-Placebo, and one AgD study comparing thalidomide to placebo 
      (Thal-Placebo). We therefore investigate two options of weighting the covariates: 
      (a) All three studies are weighted separately to match the AgD Thal-Placebo trial. 
      (b) Patients are weighted across all three IPD studies to match the AgD Thal-Placebo 
      trial, but the NMA considers each trial separately. We observe limited benefit to 
      MAIC in the full network population. While MAIC can be beneficial as a sensitivity 
      analysis to confirm results across patient populations, we advise that MAIC is used 
      and interpreted with caution.

TI  - Risk of intracerebral haemorrhage with alteplase after acute ischaemic stroke: a 
      secondary analysis of an individual patient data meta-analysis.

LID - S1474-4422(16)30076-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/S1474-4422(16)30076-X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomised trials have shown that alteplase improves the odds of a good 
      outcome when delivered within 4·5 h of acute ischaemic stroke. However, alteplase 
      also increases the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage; we aimed to determine the 
      proportional and absolute effects of alteplase on the risks of intracerebral 
      haemorrhage, mortality, and functional impairment in different types of patients. 
      METHODS: We used individual patient data from the Stroke Thrombolysis Trialists' 
      (STT) meta-analysis of randomised trials of alteplase versus placebo (or untreated 
      control) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. We prespecified assessment of 
      three classifications of intracerebral haemorrhage: type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage 
      within 7 days; Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke Monitoring Study's 
      (SITS-MOST) haemorrhage within 24-36 h (type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage with a 
      deterioration of at least 4 points on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
      [NIHSS]); and fatal intracerebral haemorrhage within 7 days. We used logistic 
      regression, stratified by trial, to model the log odds of intracerebral haemorrhage 
      on allocation to alteplase, treatment delay, age, and stroke severity. We did 
      exploratory analyses to assess mortality after intracerebral haemorrhage and examine 
      the absolute risks of intracerebral haemorrhage in the context of functional outcome 
      at 90-180 days. FINDINGS: Data were available from 6756 participants in the nine 
      trials of intravenous alteplase versus control. Alteplase increased the odds of type 
      2 parenchymal haemorrhage (occurring in 231 [6·8%] of 3391 patients allocated 
      alteplase vs 44 [1·3%] of 3365 patients allocated control; odds ratio [OR] 5·55 [95% 
      CI 4·01-7·70]; absolute excess 5·5% [4·6-6·4]); of SITS-MOST haemorrhage (124 [3·7%] 
      of 3391 vs 19 [0·6%] of 3365; OR 6·67 [4·11-10·84]; absolute excess 3·1% [2·4-3·8]); 
      and of fatal intracerebral haemorrhage (91 [2·7%] of 3391 vs 13 [0·4%] of 3365; OR 
      7·14 [3·98-12·79]; absolute excess 2·3% [1·7-2·9]). However defined, the 
      proportional increase in intracerebral haemorrhage was similar irrespective of 
      treatment delay, age, or baseline stroke severity, but the absolute excess risk of 
      intracerebral haemorrhage increased with increasing stroke severity: for SITS-MOST 
      intracerebral haemorrhage the absolute excess risk ranged from 1·5% (0·8-2·6%) for 
      strokes with NIHSS 0-4 to 3·7% (2·1-6·3%) for NIHSS 22 or more (p=0·0101). For 
      patients treated within 4·5 h, the absolute increase in the proportion (6·8% [4·0% 
      to 9·5%]) achieving a modified Rankin Scale of 0 or 1 (excellent outcome) exceeded 
      the absolute increase in risk of fatal intracerebral haemorrhage (2·2% [1·5% to 
      3·0%]) and the increased risk of any death within 90 days (0·9% [-1·4% to 3·2%]). 
      INTERPRETATION: Among patients given alteplase, the net outcome is predicted both by 
      time to treatment (with faster time increasing the proportion achieving an excellent 
      outcome) and stroke severity (with a more severe stroke increasing the absolute risk 
      of intracerebral haemorrhage). Although, within 4·5 h of stroke, the probability of 
      achieving an excellent outcome with alteplase treatment exceeds the risk of death, 
      early treatment is especially important for patients with severe stroke. FUNDING: UK

TI  - Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of artemisinin-based 
      and quinine-based treatments for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in pregnancy: 
      methodological challenges.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no agreed standard method to assess the efficacy of 
      anti-malarials for uncomplicated falciparum in pregnancy despite an increased risk 
      of adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus. The aim of this review is to 
      present the currently available evidence from both observational and interventional 
      cohort studies on anti-malarial efficacy in pregnancy and summarize the variability 
      of assessment and reporting found in the review process. METHODS: Efficacy 
      methodology and assessment of artemisinin-based treatments (ABT) and quinine-based 
      treatments (QBT) were reviewed systematically using seven databases and two clinical 
      trial registries (protocol registration-PROSPERO: CRD42017054808). Pregnant women in 
      all trimesters with parasitologically confirmed uncomplicated falciparum malaria 
      were included irrespective of symptoms. This review attempted to re-calculate 
      proportions of treatment success applying the same definition as the standard WHO 
      methodology for non-pregnant populations. Aggregated data meta-analyses using data 
      from randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments were performed 
      by random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 48 eligible efficacy studies were 
      identified including 7279 treated Plasmodium falciparum episodes. While polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) was used in 24 studies for differentiating recurrence, the 
      assessment and reporting of treatment efficacy was heterogeneous. When the same 
      definition could be applied, PCR-corrected treatment failure of ≥ 10% at any time 
      points was observed in 3/30 ABT and 3/7 QBT arms. Ten RCTs compared different 
      combinations of ABT but there was a maximum of two published RCTs with PCR-corrected 
      outcomes for each comparison. Five RCTs compared ABT and QBT. Overall, the risk of 
      treatment failure was significantly lower in ABT than in QBT (risk ratio 0.22, 95% 
      confidence interval 0.07-0.63), although the actual drug combinations and outcome 
      endpoints were different. First trimester women were included in 12 studies none of 
      which were RCTs of ABT. CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy studies in pregnancy are not only 
      limited in number but use varied methodological assessments. In five RCTs with 
      comparable methodology, ABT resulted in higher efficacy than QBT in the second and 
      third trimester of pregnancy. Individual patient data meta-analysis can include data 
      from observational cohort studies and could overcome some of the limitations of the 
      current assessment given the paucity of data in this vulnerable group.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine whether online family problem-solving 
      treatment (OFPST) is more effective in improving behavioral outcomes after pediatric 
      traumatic brain injury with increasing time since injury. METHODS: This was an 
      individual participant data meta-analysis of outcome data from 5 randomized 
      controlled trials of OFPST conducted between 2003 and 2016. We included 359 children 
      ages 5 to 18 years who were hospitalized for moderate-to-severe traumatic brain 
      injury 1 to 24 months earlier. Outcomes, assessed pre- and posttreatment, included 
      parent-reported measures of externalizing, internalizing, and executive function 
      behaviors and social competence. RESULTS: Participants included 231 boys and 128 
      girls with an average age at injury of 13.6 years. Time since injury and age at 
      injury moderated OFPST efficacy. For earlier ages and short time since injury, 
      control participants demonstrated better externalizing problem scores than those 
      receiving OFPST (Cohen's d = 0.44; P = .008; n = 295), whereas at older ages and 
      longer time since injury, children receiving OFPST had better scores (Cohen's d = 
      -0.60; P = .002). Children receiving OFPST were rated as having better executive 
      functioning relative to control participants at a later age at injury, with greater 
      effects seen at longer (Cohen's d = -0.66; P = .009; n = 298) than shorter (Cohen's 
      d = -0. 28; P = .028) time since injury. CONCLUSIONS: OFPST may be more beneficial 
      for older children and when begun after the initial months postinjury. With these 
      findings, we shed light on the optimal application of family problem-solving 
      treatments within the first 2 years after injury.

PG  - 52-66

AB  - Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a form of alcoholic liver disease. Glucocorticosteroids 
      (GCS) are used as anti - inflammatory drugs for people with alcoholic hepatitis. 
      AIM: To assess the benefits and harms of GCS in people with AH. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: We identified trials through electronic searches in Cochrane 
      Hepato-Biliary's (CHB) Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, 
      and Science Citation Index Expanded. We considered for inclusion randomised clinical 
      trials (RCTs) assessing GCS versus placebo/no intervention in adult participants 
      with AH. We allowed co - interventions in the trial groups if they were similar. We 
      followed Cochrane methodology, CHB Group methodology using Review Manager 5 and 
      Trial Sequential Analysis(TSA) to perform meta - analysis (M-A), assessed bias risk 
      of the trials, certainty of evidence using GRADE. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Sixteen 
      trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Fifteen trials provided data for analysis 
      (927 participants received GCS, 934 - placebo/no intervention). The GCS were 
      administered to adult participants at different stages of AH orally or parenterally 
      for a median of 28 days. There was no evidence of effect of GCCs on our primary 
      outcomes all - cause mortality up to 3 months following randomisation (RR 0.90, 95% 
      CI 0.70-1.15; n=1861), on health - related quality of life (MD - 0.04 points; 95% CI 
      -0.11-0.03; n=377; trial = 1) (EQ-5D-3L scale), on the occurrence of serious adverse 
      events during treatment (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85-1.29; n=1861). We found no evidence of 
      a difference between the intervention groups. The risk of bias was high in all the 
      trials except one. The certainty of evidence was very low or low. One of the trials 
      seems to be not industry - funded. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of a difference 
      between GCS and placebo or no intervention on all - cause mortality, health - 
      related quality of life, and serious adverse events during treatment. We cannot 
      exclude increases in adverse events and cannot rule out significant benefits and 
      harms of GCSs. Future trials ought to report depersonalised individual participant 
      data.

TI  - Tramadol versus Celecoxib for reducing pain associated with outpatient hysteroscopy: 
      a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 60-6
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dev291 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Which is better, Tramadol or Celecoxib, in reducing pain associated 
      with outpatient hysteroscopy? SUMMARY ANSWER: Both Tramadol and Celecoxib are 
      effective in reducing pain associated with outpatient hysteroscopy but Celecoxib may 
      be better tolerated. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Pain is the most common cause of failure 
      of outpatient hysteroscopy. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed that local 
      anaesthetics were effective in reducing pain associated with hysteroscopy but there 
      was insufficient evidence to support the use of oral analgesics, opioids and 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, to reduce hysteroscopy-associated pain and 
      further studies were recommended. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a 
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with balanced randomization 
      (allocation ratio 1:1:1) conducted in a university hospital from May 2014 to 
      November 2014. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Two hundred and ten women 
      who had diagnostic outpatient hysteroscopy were randomly divided into three equal 
      groups: Group 1 received oral Tramadol 100 mg, group 2 received Celecoxib 200 mg and 
      group 3 received an oral placebo. All the drugs were given 1 h before the procedure. 
      A patient's perception of pain was assessed during the procedure, immediately 
      afterwards and 30 min after the procedure with the use of a visual analogue scale 
      (VAS). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There was a significant difference in 
      the pain scores among the groups during the procedure, immediately afterwards and 30 
      min after the procedure (P< 0.001, 0.001, <0.001 respectively). Tramadol had 
      significantly lower pain scores when compared with the placebo during the procedure 
      (mean difference = 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.86, 2.22), P < 0.001), 
      immediately after the procedure (mean difference = 1.09; 95% CI (0.5, 1.68), P < 
      0.001) and 30 min later (mean difference = 0.95, 95% CI (0.48, 1.41), P < 0.001). 
      Celecoxib administration also led to significantly lower pain scores than the 
      placebo during the procedure (mean difference = 1.28, 95% CI (0.62, 1.94), P < 
      0.001), immediately after the procedure (mean difference = 0.72; 95% CI (0.13, 
      1.32), P = 0.016) and 30 min later (mean difference = 0.77, 95% CI (0.3, 1.24), P = 
      0.001). There were no significant differences in pain scores between Tramadol and 
      Celecoxib at any time. Time until no pain differed significantly among the groups (P 
      = 0.01); it was shorter with both Tramadol and Celecoxib groups when compared with 
      placebo (P = 0.002 and 0.046, respectively). The procedure failed to be completed in 
      one patient in the placebo group but no failure to complete the procedure occurred 
      in Tramadol and Celecoxib groups. Four women in the Tramadol group reported nausea 
      but no side effects were reported with Celecoxib group and no complications were 
      reported in any group of patients. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: All results 
      were based on the subjective perception of pain, which varies among individuals and 
      is related to the individuals' previous pain experience and level of anxiety. WIDER 
      IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Tramadol and Celecoxib are effective in reducing pain 
      in outpatient hysteroscopy. Celecoxib may be better tolerated as no side effects 
      were reported in the study, however further research on a larger sample size is 
      required before drawing firm conclusions about lack of side effects. STUDY 
      FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This research did not receive any specific grant from 
      any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sector. All authors

AB  - Although some risk factors for breast cancer might be protective for osteoporosis, 
      several cross-sectional studies have reported, nevertheless, that patients with 
      breast cancer have a lower bone mass and potentially a higher incidence of fractures 
      than expected. In any case, it appears that patients with breast cancer are not 
      protected from osteoporosis, which provides further support for the recommendation 
      that bone health is assessed after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Most adjuvant 
      therapies will lead to increased bone loss and a higher fracture rate. Among the 
      adjuvant therapy options for premenopausal patients with breast cancer, endocrine 
      therapy (ovarian suppression) and chemotherapy can result in cancer 
      treatment-induced bone loss (CTIBL) of up to 10% at the lumbar spine after one year. 
      Antiresorptive therapies prevent CTIBL in premenopausal women with breast cancer. 
      Most of the evidence demonstrating the efficacy of bisphosphonates in the prevention 
      of CTIBL is derived from clinical trials with zoledronic acid. The addition of 
      zoledronic acid 4mg per six months to adjuvant endocrine therapy maintained and even 
      increased bone mass during a 3-year treatment period and significantly improved 
      disease-free survival in a population of young women who underwent menopause due to 
      the adjuvant treatment. The major contributor to bone loss in the adjuvant treatment 
      of breast cancer in postmenopausal women is the use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs). 
      Oncology trials have underestimated the fracture risk in the setting of AI-induced 
      bone loss. In the ABCSG-18 study, the only trial in which fracture incidence was the 
      primary endpoint, the rate of clinical fractures was close to 10% after 3 years in 
      the placebo group on AIs only. Bisphosphonates and denosumab at osteoporosis 
      treatment doses can counteract AI-induced bone loss. In the ABCSG-18 trial, 
      treatment with denosumab 60mg injection every 6 months reduced the risk of first 
      clinical fracture relative to placebo by 50%. Current guidelines recommend 
      antiresorptive therapy in patients with a baseline T score of <-2.0 or with two or 
      more clinical risk factors for fracture. These recent guidelines will need to be 
      updated, as similar significant protective effects were seen in women with either 
      normal or low bone mass. Moreover, a formal meta-analysis of individual patient data 
      from more than 18,000 women in 26 randomized trials of adjuvant zoledronic acid or 
      clodronate treatment for early breast cancer revealed that bisphosphonates 
      significantly reduced the risk of first distant recurrence in bone and the risk of 
      breast cancer mortality, at least in postmenopausal women. Even though the increased 
      risk of fracture during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer in postmenopausal women 
      is notable, an enhanced risk of fracture in long-term survivors of breast cancer 
      remains under debate. The most recent studies suggest that Caucasian breast cancer 
      survivors do not have a significantly increased risk of osteoporotic fracture over 
      the long term.

TI  - Oncological Outcomes of Major Liver Resection Following Portal Vein Embolization: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 3709-3717
LID - 10.1245/s10434-016-5264-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative portal vein occlusion with either percutaneous portal vein 
      embolization (PVE) or portal vein ligation is routinely used to induce liver 
      hypertrophy prior to major liver resection in patients with hepatic malignancy. 
      While this increases the future liver remnant, and hence the number of patients 
      suitable for resection, recent evidence suggests that induction of liver hypertrophy 
      preoperatively may promote tumor growth and increase recurrence rates. The aims of 
      this current study were to evaluate the impact of PVE on hepatic recurrence rate and 
      survival in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). METHODS: The MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies assessing the 
      oncological outcomes of patients undergoing major liver resection for CRLM following 
      PVE. Studies comparing patients undergoing one-stage liver resection with or without 
      preoperative PVE were included. The primary outcome was postoperative hepatic 
      recurrence (PHR), while secondary outcomes were 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS). 
      RESULTS: Of the 2131 studies identified, six non-randomized studies (n = 668) met 
      the eligibility criteria, comparing outcomes of patients undergoing major liver 
      resection with or without PVE (n = 182 and n = 486, respectively). No significant 
      difference was observed in PHR (odds ratio [OR] 0.78; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 
      0.42-1.44), 3-year OS (OR 0.80; 95 % CI 0.56-1.14) or 5-year OS (OR 1.12; 95 % CI 
      0.40-3.11). CONCLUSIONS: PVE does not have any adverse effect on PHR or OS in 
      patients undergoing major liver resection for CRLM. Further studies based on 
      individual patient data are needed to provide definitive answers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression in children and adolescents are undertreated. 
      Computer- and Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatments (cCBT) may be an 
      attractive treatment alternative to regular face-to-face treatment.This 
      meta-analysis aims to evaluate whether cCBT is effective for treating symptoms of 
      anxiety and depression in youth. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted systematic 
      searches in bibliographical databases (Pubmed, Cochrane controlled trial register, 
      PsychInfo) up to December 4, 2013. Only randomized controlled trials in which a 
      computer-, Internet- or mobile-based cognitive behavioral intervention targeting 
      either depression, anxiety or both in children or adolescents up to the age of 25 
      were compared to a control condition were selected. We employed a random-effects 
      pooling model in overall effect analyses and a mixed effect model for sub-group 
      analyses. Searches resulted in identifying 13 randomized trials, including 796 
      children and adolescents that met inclusion criteria. Seven studies were directed at 
      treating anxiety, four studies at depression, and two were of a transdiagnostic 
      nature, targeting both anxiety and depression. The overall mean effect size (Hedges' 
      g) of cCBT on symptoms of anxiety or depression at post-test was g=0.72 (95% 
      CI:0.55-0.90, numbers needed to be treated (NNT)=2.56). Heterogeneity was low 
      (I²=20.14%, 95% CI: 0-58%). The superiority of cCBT over controls was evident for 
      interventions targeting anxiety (g=0.68; 95% CI: 0.45-0.92; p < .001; NNT=2.70) and 
      for interventions targeting depression (g=0.76; 95% CI: 0.41-0.12; p < .001; 
      NNT=2.44) as well as for transdiagnostic interventions (g=0.94; 95% CI: 0.23-2.66; p 
      < .001; NNT=2.60). CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence for the efficacy of cCBT in 
      the treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms in youth. Hence, such interventions 
      may be a promising treatment alternative when evidence based face-to-face treatment 
      is not feasible. Future studies should examine long-term effects of treatments and 
      should focus on obtaining patient-level data from existing studies, to perform an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis.

TI  - The use of intravenous magnesium in non-preeclamptic pregnant women: fetal/neonatal 
      neuroprotection.
PG  - 969-75
LID - 10.1007/s00404-014-3581-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the effect of intravenous magnesium in obstetrics on 
      fetal/neonatal neuroprotection. METHODS: A systematic review of published studies. 
      RESULTS: Five randomized trials and 4 meta-analyses have shown a significant 32% 
      reduction of cerebral palsy when administering magnesium sulfate in case of preterm 
      delivery. The pathophysiologic mechanism is not fully unraveled: modulation of the 
      inflammatory process, both in the mother and the fetus, and downregulation of 
      neuronal stimulation seem to be involved. After long-term high-dose intravenous 
      administration of magnesium, maternal and neonatal adverse effects such as maternal 
      and neonatal hypotonia and osteoporosis and specific fetal/neonatal cerebral lesions 
      have been described. In case of administration for less than 48 h at 1 g/h and a 
      loading dose of 4 g, these toxic amounts are not achieved. American, Canadian and 
      Australian guidelines recommend the use of intravenous magnesium in any threatening 
      delivery at less than 32 weeks. The "number needed to treat" to avoid 1 cerebral 
      palsy is between 15 and 35. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous magnesium significantly reduces 
      the risk for cerebral palsy in preterm birth. Open questions remain the optimal 
      dosing schedule, whether or not repeating when delivery has been successfully 
      postponed and a new episode of preterm labor occurs. Some concern has been raised on 
      a too optimistic value for random error which might have led to over-optimistic 
      conclusions in classic meta-analysis. Randomized trials comparing different doses 
      and individual patient data meta-analysis might resolve these issues.

AB  - A comprehensive meta-analysis of statin add-on therapy in the antipsychotic 
      treatment of schizophrenia was conducted. Data from previous studies, prior to 
      8/21/2017, was obtained from Scopus, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. Both a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted with patient data from randomized 
      placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) to compare statins with placebo in order to 
      calculate effect size. Across the five RCTs (mean duration: 9.2 weeks), 236 adult 
      patients with schizophrenia were randomly selected to receive either placebo (n=117) 
      or statins (n=119). Pooled statin add-on therapy showed significant superiority over 
      placebo in the improvement of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total 
      scores (mean difference=-1.96; 95% confidence interval, -2.94 to -0.98; p<0.0001; 
      I(2)=0%; N=4, n=174). However, there were no statistically significant differences 
      in other efficacy outcomes between the two treatment groups. Statin did not have a 
      significant difference in its incidence of discontinuation or have individual 
      adverse events compared to placebo. Our results suggest that statins may have 
      considerable potential as an add-on therapy for schizophrenia. However, determining 
      the effectiveness of this treatment in clinical practice requires future 
      investigation due to limitations of the current evidence-base including small 
      sample, potential for publication and selection biases and short duration of 
      follow-up.

TI  - Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention: Meta-Analysis of Federally Funded Program 
      Evaluations.
PG  - e1-e8
LID - 10.2105/AJPH.2018.304925 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beginning in 2010, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
      funded more than 40 evaluations of adolescent pregnancy prevention interventions. 
      The government's emphasis on rigor and transparency, along with a requirement that 
      grantees collect standardized behavioral outcomes, ensured that findings could be 
      meaningfully compared across evaluations. OBJECTIVES: We used random and 
      mixed-effects meta-analysis to analyze the findings generated by these evaluations 
      to learn whether program elements, program implementation features, and participant 
      demographics were associated with effects on adolescent sexual risk behavior. SEARCH 
      METHODS: We screened all 43 independent evaluation reports, some of which included 
      multiple studies, funded by HHS and completed before October 1, 2016. HHS released, 
      and our team considered, all such studies regardless of favorability or statistical 
      significance. SELECTION CRITERIA: Of these studies, we included those that used a 
      randomized or high-quality quasi-experimental research design. We excluded studies 
      that did not use statistical matching or provide pretest equivalence data on a 
      measure of sexual behavior or a close proxy. We also excluded studies that compared 
      2 pregnancy prevention interventions without a control group. A total of 44 studies 
      from 39 reports, comprising 51 150 youths, met the inclusion criteria. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two researchers extracted data from each study by using 
      standard systematic reviewing and meta-analysis procedures. In addition, study 
      authors provided individual participant data for a subset of 34 studies. We used 
      mixed-effects meta-regressions with aggregate data to examine whether program or 
      participant characteristics were associated with program effects on adolescent 
      sexual risk behaviors and consequences. To examine whether individual-level 
      participant characteristics such as age, gender, and race/ethnicity were associated 
      with program effects, we used a 1-stage meta-regression approach combining 
      participant-level data (48 635 youths) with aggregate data from the 10 studies for 
      which participant-level data were not available. MAIN RESULTS: Across all 44 
      studies, we found small but statistically insignificant mean effects favoring the 
      programs and little variability around those means. Only 2 program characteristics 
      showed statistically reliable relationships with program effects. First, 
      gender-specific (girl-only) programs yielded a statistically significant average 
      effect size (P < .05). Second, programs with individualized service delivery were 
      more effective than programs delivering services to youths in small groups 
      (P < .05). We found no other statistically significant associations between program 
      effects and program or participant characteristics, or evaluation methods. Nor was 
      there a statistically significant difference in the mean effect sizes for programs 
      with previous evidence of effectiveness and previously untested programs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although several individual studies reported positive impacts, the 
      average effects were small and there was minimal variation in effect sizes across 
      studies on all of the outcomes assessed. Thus, we were unable to confidently 
      identify which individual program characteristics were associated with effects. 
      However, these studies examined relatively short-term effects and it is an open 
      question whether some programs, perhaps with distinctive characteristics, will show 
      longer-term effects as more of the adolescent participants become sexually active. 
      Public Health Implications. The success of a small number of individualized 
      interventions designed specifically for girls in changing behavioral outcomes 
      suggests the need to reexamine the assumptions that underlie coed group approaches. 
      However, given the almost total absence of similar programs targeting male 
      adolescents, it is likely to be some time before evidence to support or reject such 
      an approach for boys is available.

TI  - Effectiveness of progestogens to improve perinatal outcome in twin pregnancies: an 
      individual participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - 27-37
LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.13032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In twin pregnancies, the rates of adverse perinatal outcome and 
      subsequent long-term morbidity are substantial, and mainly result from preterm birth 
      (PTB). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of progestogen treatment in the 
      prevention of neonatal morbidity or PTB in twin pregnancies using individual 
      participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched international 
      scientific databases, trial registration websites, and references of identified 
      articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of 
      17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17Pc) or vaginally administered natural 
      progesterone, compared with placebo or no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      Investigators of identified RCTs were asked to share their IPD. The primary outcome 
      was a composite of perinatal mortality and severe neonatal morbidity. Prespecified 
      subgroup analyses were performed for chorionicity, cervical length, and prior 
      spontaneous PTB. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen trials included 3768 women and their 7536 
      babies. Neither 17Pc nor vaginal progesterone reduced the incidence of adverse 
      perinatal outcome (17Pc relative risk, RR 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 
      0.97-1.4, vaginal progesterone RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.77-1.2). In a subgroup of women 
      with a cervical length of ≤25 mm, vaginal progesterone reduced adverse perinatal 
      outcome when cervical length was measured at randomisation (15/56 versus 22/60; RR 
      0.57; 95% CI 0.47-0.70) or before 24 weeks of gestation (14/52 versus 21/56; RR 
      0.56; 95% CI 0.42-0.75). AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: In unselected women with an 
      uncomplicated twin gestation, treatment with progestogens (intramuscular 17Pc or 
      vaginal natural progesterone) does not improve perinatal outcome. Vaginal 
      progesterone may be effective in the reduction of adverse perinatal outcome in women 
      with a cervical length of ≤25 mm; however, further research is warranted to confirm 
      this finding.

TI  - Effects of blood pressure reduction in mild hypertension: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 184-91
LID - 10.7326/M14-0773 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effects of blood pressure reduction in persons with grade 1 hypertension 
      are unclear. PURPOSE: To investigate whether pharmacologic blood pressure reduction 
      prevents cardiovascular events and deaths in persons with grade 1 hypertension. DATA 
      SOURCES: Trials included in the BPLTTC (Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' 
      Collaboration) and trials identified from a previous review and electronic database 
      searches. STUDY SELECTION: Patients without cardiovascular disease with blood 
      pressures in the grade 1 hypertension range (140 to 159/90 to 99 mm Hg) who were 
      randomly assigned to an active (antihypertensive drug or more intensive regimen) or 
      control (placebo or less intensive regimen) blood pressure-lowering regimen. DATA 
      EXTRACTION: Individual-patient data from BPLTTC trials and aggregate data from other 
      trials were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed for all trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: 
      Individual-patient data involved 10 comparisons from trials where most patients had 
      diabetes, and aggregate data involved 3 comparisons from trials of patients without 
      diabetes. The average blood pressure reduction was about 3.6/2.4 mm Hg. Over 5 
      years, odds ratios were 0.86 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.01) for total cardiovascular events, 
      0.72 (CI, 0.55 to 0.94) for strokes, 0.91 (CI, 0.74 to 1.12) for coronary events, 
      0.80 (CI, 0.57 to 1.12) for heart failure, 0.75 (CI, 0.57 to 0.98) for 
      cardiovascular deaths, and 0.78 (CI, 0.67 to 0.92) for total deaths. Results were 
      similar in secondary analyses. Withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects was 
      more common in the active groups. LIMITATION: Blood pressure reductions and numbers 
      of events were small. CONCLUSION: Blood pressure-lowering therapy is likely to 
      prevent stroke and death in patients with uncomplicated grade 1 hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying risk factors for specific modes of death in patients with 
      heart failure (HF) or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after acute myocardial 
      infarction (MI) may help to avert events. We sought to evaluate LV ejection fraction 
      (LVEF) as a prognosticator of specific death modes. METHODS AND RESULTS: In an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis of four merged trials (CAPRICORN, EPHESUS, 
      OPTIMAAL, and VALIANT), Cox modelling was performed to study the association between 
      baseline LVEF from 19,740 patients and types of death during follow-up. Over a 
      median follow-up of 707 days 3419 deaths occurred. The distribution pattern for mode 
      of death was similar across categories (LVEF < 25%, LVEF 25-35%, and LVEF > 35%). In 
      multivariable models, the risk of all types of death increased with decreasing LVEF. 
      If compared to LVEF > 35%, LVEF < 25% was associated with a 113% increased risk of 
      sudden death (hazard ratio (HR) 2.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53-2.98), a 
      170% increased risk of HF death (HR 2.70, 95% CI 1.83-3.98), a 66% increased risk of 
      other cardiovascular (CV) death (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.14-2.42), and a 90% increased 
      risk of non CV death (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.15-3.14). CONCLUSION: In patients with HF or 
      LV dysfunction after acute MI, low LVEF is a ubiquitous risk marker associated with 
      death regardless of type. The different modes of death are fairly equally 
      represented throughout the categories of LVEF and sudden death remains a significant 
      mode of death also in patients with LVEF > 35%.

TI  - Prognostic value of premorbid hypertension and neurological status in aneurysmal 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage: pooled analyses of individual patient data in the SAHIT 
      repository.
PG  - 644-52
LID - 10.3171/2014.10.JNS132694 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: The literature has conflicting reports about the prognostic value of 
      premorbid hypertension and neurological status in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage 
      (SAH). The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of premorbid 
      hypertension and neurological status in the SAH International Trialists repository. 
      METHODS: Patient-level meta-analyses were conducted to investigate univariate 
      associations between premorbid hypertension (6 studies; n = 7249), admission 
      neurological status measured on the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies 
      (WFNS) scale (10 studies; n = 10,869), and 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 
      score. Multivariable analyses were performed to sequentially adjust for the effects 
      of age, CT clot burden, aneurysm location, aneurysm size, and modality of aneurysm 
      repair. Prognostic associations were estimated across the ordered categories of the 
      GOS using proportional odds models. Nagelkerke's R(2) statistic was used to quantify 
      the added prognostic value of hypertension and neurological status beyond those of 
      the adjustment factors. RESULTS: Premorbid hypertension was independently associated 
      with poor outcome, with an unadjusted pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.73 (95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 1.50-2.00) and an adjusted OR of 1.38 (95% CI 1.25-1.53). Patients 
      with a premorbid history of hypertension had higher rates of cardiovascular and 
      renal comorbidities, poorer neurological status (p ≤ 0.001), and higher odds of 
      neurological complications including cerebral infarctions, hydrocephalus, 
      rebleeding, and delayed ischemic neurological deficits. Worsening neurological 
      status was strongly independently associated with poor outcome, including WFNS 
      Grades II (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.68-2.03), III (OR 3.85, 95% CI 3.32-4.47), IV (OR 5.58, 
      95% CI 4.91-6.35), and V (OR 14.18, 95% CI 12.20-16.49). Neurological status had 
      substantial added predictive value greater than the combined value of other 
      prognostic factors (R(2) increase > 10%), while the added predictive value of 
      hypertension was marginal (R(2) increase < 0.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed 
      the strong prognostic effect of neurological status as measured on the WFNS scale 
      and the independent but weak prognostic effect of premorbid hypertension. The effect 
      of premorbid hypertension could involve multifactorial mechanisms, including an 
      increase in the severity of initial bleeding, the rate of comorbid events, and 
      neurological complications.

TI  - Clinical determinants of early parasitological response to ACTs in African patients 
      with uncomplicated falciparum malaria: a literature review and meta-analysis of 
      individual patient data.
PG  - 212
LID - 10.1186/s12916-015-0445-x [doi]
LID - 212
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has emerged in the Greater 
      Mekong sub-region and poses a major global public health threat. Slow parasite 
      clearance is a key clinical manifestation of reduced susceptibility to artemisinin. 
      This study was designed to establish the baseline values for clearance in patients 
      from Sub-Saharan African countries with uncomplicated malaria treated with 
      artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). METHODS: A literature review in 
      PubMed was conducted in March 2013 to identify all prospective clinical trials 
      (uncontrolled trials, controlled trials and randomized controlled trials), including 
      ACTs conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa, between 1960 and 2012. Individual patient data 
      from these studies were shared with the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network 
      (WWARN) and pooled using an a priori statistical analytical plan. Factors affecting 
      early parasitological response were investigated using logistic regression with 
      study sites fitted as a random effect. The risk of bias in included studies was 
      evaluated based on study design, methodology and missing data. RESULTS: In total, 
      29,493 patients from 84 clinical trials were included in the analysis, treated with 
      artemether-lumefantrine (n = 13,664), artesunate-amodiaquine (n = 11,337) and 
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n = 4,492). The overall parasite clearance rate was 
      rapid. The parasite positivity rate (PPR) decreased from 59.7 % (95 % CI: 54.5-64.9) 
      on day 1 to 6.7 % (95 % CI: 4.8-8.7) on day 2 and 0.9 % (95 % CI: 0.5-1.2) on day 3. 
      The 95th percentile of observed day 3 PPR was 5.3 %. Independent risk factors 
      predictive of day 3 positivity were: high baseline parasitaemia (adjusted odds ratio 
      (AOR) = 1.16 (95 % CI: 1.08-1.25); per 2-fold increase in parasite density, P 
      <0.001); fever (>37.5 °C) (AOR = 1.50 (95 % CI: 1.06-2.13), P = 0.022); severe 
      anaemia (AOR = 2.04 (95 % CI: 1.21-3.44), P = 0.008); areas of low/moderate 
      transmission setting (AOR = 2.71 (95 % CI: 1.38-5.36), P = 0.004); and treatment 
      with the loose formulation of artesunate-amodiaquine (AOR = 2.27 (95 % CI: 
      1.14-4.51), P = 0.020, compared to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      three ACTs assessed in this analysis continue to achieve rapid early parasitological

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line 
      pharmacological treatment for pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD). We 
      conducted a meta-analysis to examine the following: the time-course of response to 
      SSRIs in pediatric depression; whether higher doses of SSRIs are associated with an 
      improved response in pediatric depression; differences in efficacy between SSRI 
      agents; and whether the time-course and magnitude of response to SSRIs is different 
      in pediatric and adult patients with MDD. METHOD: We searched PubMed and CENTRAL for 
      randomized controlled trials comparing SSRIs to placebo for the treatment of 
      pediatric MDD. We extracted weekly symptom data from trials to characterize the 
      trajectory of pharmacological response to SSRIs. Pooled estimates of treatment 
      effect were calculated based on standardized mean differences between treatment and 
      placebo groups. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 13 pediatric MDD trials with a 
      total of 3,004 patients. A logarithmic model indicating that the greatest benefits 
      of SSRIs occurred early in treatment best fit the longitudinal data (log[week] = 
      0.10, 95% CI = 0.06-0.15, p < .0001). There were no significant differences based on 
      maximum SSRI dose or between particular SSRI agents. SSRIs were demonstrated to have 
      a smaller benefit in pediatric compared to adult MDD. CONCLUSION: Treatment gains in 
      pediatric MDD are greatest early in treatment and are, on average, minimal after 4 
      weeks of SSRI pharmacotherapy in pediatric MDD. Further research is needed using 
      individual patient data to examine the power of early SSRI response (e.g., 2-4 
      weeks) to predict outcomes in short-term pharmacological trials.

TI  - Meta-Analysis of First-Line Pemetrexed Plus Platinum Treatment in Compared to Other 
      Platinum-Based Doublet Regimens in Elderly East Asian Patients With Advanced 
      Nonsquamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.
PG  - e103-e112

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pemetrexed plus platinum has become a standard of care in first-line 
      treatment for patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer. 
      However, elderly lung cancer patients are generally understudied and undertreated in 
      clinical practice in East Asia because of safety concerns. This analysis aimed to 
      provide a picture of the clinical benefit of pemetrexed/platinum in the first-line 
      setting for elderly (age ≥ 65 years) East Asian patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Individual patient data from 3 randomized controlled phase 3 trials that enrolled 
      East Asian patients were analyzed in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: In elderly East 
      Asian patients (63 in the pemetrexed/platinum group and 42 in the control group), 
      pemetrexed/platinum treatment achieved more benefits compared to other 
      platinum-based doublets, including better overall response rate (32.8% vs. 7.5%), 
      favorable progression-free survival (not statistically significant in adjusted 
      hazard ratio), and significantly longer (3.15 vs. 1.54 months) survival without 
      drug-related grade 3/4 toxicity. Overall survival was numerically prolonged (16.33 
      vs. 13.77 months; not statistically significant). These benefit trends were similar 
      to those in all-age East Asian patients. In elderly East Asians, pemetrexed/platinum 
      treatment was also associated with a lower incidence rate of drug-related grade 3/4 
      adverse events. The adverse event profile was similar to that in all-age East 
      Asians. There were no unexpected adverse events. CONCLUSION: Pemetrexed/platinum had 
      good efficacy and also resulted in better overall response and tolerability than 
      other platinum-based doublets as first-line treatment in nonsquamous non-small cell 
      lung cancer in elderly East Asians, which was consistent with data observed in 
      all-age East Asians.

BTI - Effect of Thrombolytic Treatment 3 to 4.5 Hours After Onset of Stroke
AB  - The Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services (now part of the Norwegian 
      Institute of Public Health) was commissioned to update the evidence on the effect of 
      intravenous thrombolytic treatment administered 3 to 4.5 hours after stroke. There 
      was already a Cochrane systematic review by Wardlaw et al. from 2014. We searched 
      for systematic reviews published after Wardlaw’s review, but found none that 
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Then we searched for randomised controlled trials 
      published later than the search date for the Cochrane review, but we found no 
      relevant trials. We have, therefore, conveyed the findings from Wardlaw and 
      supplemented with data from an individual patient data meta-analysis. We have also 
      graded our confidence in the estimates of effect using the GRADE tool (Grading of 
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). The outcomes are assessed 
      3-6 months after the stroke and are compared with placebo. We found that intravenous 
      thrombolysis administered 3 to 4.5 hours after onset of ischemic stroke gives: 
      Uncertain effect on the outcome "alive and independent" (very low 
      quality/confidence). A positive effect on the outcome "alive with no functional 
      impairment" (moderate quality/confidence). Between 37 fewer and 36 more per 1000 in 
      risk of death (low quality/confidence). Uncertain risk of symptomatic intracranial 
      haemorrhage (very low quality/confidence).

TI  - Dose-response effect of the lercanidipine/enalapril combination: a pooled analysis.
PG  - 17-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The dose-effect relationship of fixed-dose combinations of 
      anti-hypertensive drugs has been only poorly explored. This pooled analysis 
      investigates the dose-response relationship of fixed-dose lercanidipine + enalapril 
      in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 
      was an individual patient data analysis of four randomized studies (n = 2340). MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in 
      sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP). Secondary variables were change from 
      baseline in sitting systolic BP (SSBP), proportion of responder patients, and 
      safety. RESULTS: All fixed-dose combinations were superior to placebo in the 
      reduction of SDBP. The greatest effect was observed with the market-available 
      combination lercanidipine 20 mg/enalapril 20 mg (-15.3 mmHg vs. baseline; p < 0.05). 
      The reduction in SDBP associated with the other two marketed fixed combinations of 
      lercanidipine/enalapril were -10.7 mmHg for the 10 mg/20 mg combination and 
      -9.8 mmHg for the 10 mg/10 mg combination (p < .05 for both comparisons). Similar 
      findings were reported for SSBP reduction: the greatest effect was observed with 
      lercanidipine 20 mg/enalapril 20 mg (-19.2 mmHg). The reduction in SSBP was 
      -12.5 mmHg for the 10 mg/20 mg combination and -11.1 mmHg for the 10 mg/10 mg 
      combination (p < .05 for all comparisons). The highest responder rate was reported 
      with lercanidipine 20 mg/enalapril 20 mg (75.0%); this figure was 56.1% with the 
      10 mg/20 mg and 53.0% with the 10/10 mg combination. No safety concerns were 
      reported. CONCLUSION: This pooled analysis of four randomized studies shows evidence 
      of a dose-response effect in BP reduction with different fixed combinations of 
      lercanidipine + enalapril. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis 
      investigating the dose-response effect of a specific fixed-dose combination of 
      anti-hypertensive agents. Further studies on this intriguing topic are however 
      necessary.

AB  - Clinical trials and basic science studies without statistically significant results 
      are less likely to be published than studies with statistically significant results. 
      Systematic reviews and meta-analyses that omit unpublished data are at high risk of 
      distorted conclusions. Here, we describe methods to search beyond bibliographical 
      databases to reduce evidence selection bias in systematic reviews. Unpublished 
      studies may be identified by searching conference proceedings. Moreover, clinical 
      trial registries-databases of planned and ongoing trials-and regulatory agency 
      websites such as the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and the United States Food and 
      Drug Administration (FDA) may provide summaries of efficacy and safety data. Primary 
      and secondary outcomes are prespecified in trial registries, thus allowing the 
      assessment of outcome reporting bias by comparison with the trial report. The 
      sources of trial data and documents are still evolving, with ongoing initiatives 
      promoting broader access to clinical study reports and individual patient data. 
      There is currently no established methodology to ensure that the multiple sources of 
      information are incorporated. Nonetheless, systematic reviews must adapt to these 
      improvements and cover the new sources in their search strategies.

TI  - Surrogate endpoints for overall survival in lung cancer trials: a review.
PG  - 447-454
LID - 10.1080/14737140.2017.1316196 [doi]
AB  - Intermediate endpoints are often used as primary endpoints instead of overall 
      survival (OS) in lung cancer trials but they are not systematically validated as 
      surrogate endpoints for OS. Areas covered: The aim of the study was to review the 
      studies which assessed potential surrogate endpoints for OS in lung cancer trials. 
      Expert commentary: Twenty studies were identified. In operable non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC) (adjuvant trials) and locally advanced NSCLC (radiotherapy trials), 
      one individual-patient data meta-analysis found a high correlation of disease-free 
      survival (DFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) with OS at patient and trial 
      level. In trials of adjuvant chemotherapy, correlation between disease-free survival 
      DFS and OS were 0.83 at the individual level (95% CI 0.83-0.83) and 0.92 at trial 
      level (95% CI 0.88-0.95). In locally advanced disease, correlation between PFS and 
      OS was 0.77 to 0.85 at the individual level, and 0.89 to 0.97 at trial level. This 
      study provides a 'proof' of the surrogacy of PFS and DFS on OS according to the 
      IQWiG framework and the surrogacy of PFS and DFS on OS was classified level 2 
      according to Fleming hierarchy. In all the other setting, no endpoint was judged to 
      be valid surrogate for OS.

TI  - Long working hours and stroke among employees in the general workforce of Denmark.
PG  - 368-374
LID - 10.1177/1403494817748264 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: A systematic review and meta-analysis have found that long working hours were 
      prospectively associated with an increased risk of overall stroke. The primary aim 
      of the present study was to test if this finding could be reproduced in a sample 
      that has been randomly selected from the general workforce of Denmark. A secondary 
      aim was to estimate the association for haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke 
      separately. METHODS: Individual participant data on 20- to 64-year-old employees 
      were drawn from the Danish Labour Force Survey, 1999-2013, and linked to data on 
      socio-economic status (SES), migrations, hospitalisations and deaths from national 
      registers. The participants were followed from the time of the interview until the 
      end of 2014. Poisson regression was used to estimate age-, sex- and SES-adjusted 
      rate ratios for stroke as a function of weekly working hours. RESULTS: With 35-40 
      working hours per week as reference, the estimated rate ratios for overall stroke 
      were 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-1.13) for 41-48 working hours, 1.10 
      (95% CI 0.86-1.39) for 49-54 working hours and 0.89 (95% CI 0.69-1.16) for ≥55 
      working hours. The estimated rate ratios per one category increase in working hours 
      were 0.99 (95% CI 0.93-1.06) for overall stroke, 0.96 (95% CI 0.88-1.05) for 
      ischaemic stroke and 1.15 (95% CI 1.02-1.31) for haemorrhagic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our analysis does not support the hypothesis that long working hours are associated 
      with increased rates of overall stroke. It suggests, however, that long working 
      hours might be associated with increased rates of haemorrhagic stroke.

TI  - [Treatments for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder: what is the evidence base to date?].
PG  - S3-S7
AB  - The evidence base from empirical studies is one of the elements, along with 
      patients' preference and consideration of particular clinical state and 
      circumstances, that should be taken into account in the process of clinical decision 
      making. This paper provides an overview of the current evidence base for the 
      treatment of attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), drawing on the results 
      of the most recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials assessing the 
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of ADHD. Overall, available recent 
      meta-analyses show that psychostimulants, and, although to a less extent, non 
      psychostimulants, are efficacious in terms of control of core ADHD symptoms, at 
      least in the short term; and although the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatments 
      (behavioral interventions, diet, cognitive training and neurofeedback) for ADHD core 
      symptoms remains uncertain, some non-pharmacological approach are efficacious for 
      ADHD-related problems, such as behavioral interventions for oppositional problems 
      and parenting skills, and cognitive training for working memory deficits. However, 
      most of the available randomized controlled trials are short-term efficacy trials 
      recruiting selected populations of patients and, as such, they are not fully 
      informative for the daily clinical practice. Head-to-head trials, pragmatic trials, 
      placebo-withdrawal trials, network meta-analyses and individual patient data 
      meta-analyses are encouraged in the field to bridge the gap between theoretical 
      evidence and daily clinical practice.

TI  - Many continuous variables should be analyzed using the relative scale: a case study 
      of β(2)-agonists for preventing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.
PG  - 282
LID - 10.1186/s13643-019-1183-5 [doi]
LID - 282
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative scale adjusts for baseline variability and therefore may 
      lead to findings that can be generalized more widely. It is routinely used for the 
      analysis of binary outcomes but only rarely for continuous outcomes. Our objective 
      was to compare relative vs absolute scale pooled outcomes using data from a recently 
      published Cochrane systematic review that reported only absolute effects of inhaled 
      β(2)-agonists on exercise-induced decline in forced-expiratory volumes in 1 s 
      (FEV(1)). METHODS: From the Cochrane review, we selected placebo-controlled 
      cross-over studies that reported individual participant data (IPD). Reversal in 
      FEV(1) decline after exercise was modeled as a mean uniform percentage point (pp) 
      change (absolute effect) or average percent change (relative effect) using either 
      intercept-only or slope-only, respectively, linear mixed-effect models. We also 
      calculated the pooled relative effect estimates using standard random-effects, 
      inverse-variance-weighting meta-analysis using study-level mean effects. RESULTS: 
      Fourteen studies with 187 participants were identified for the IPD analysis. On the 
      absolute scale, β(2)-agonists decreased the exercise-induced FEV(1) decline by 
      28 pp., and on the relative scale, they decreased the FEV(1) decline by 90%. The fit 
      of the statistical model was significantly better with the relative 90% estimate 
      compared with the absolute 28 pp. estimate. Furthermore, the median residuals (5.8 
      vs. 10.8 pp) were substantially smaller in the relative effect model than in the 
      absolute effect model. Using standard study-level meta-analysis of the same 14 
      studies, β(2)-agonists reduced exercise-induced FEV(1) decline on the relative scale 
      by a similar amount: 83% or 90%, depending on the method of calculating the relative 
      effect. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the absolute scale, the relative scale captures 
      more effectively the variation in the effects of β(2)-agonists on exercise-induced 
      FEV(1)-declines. The absolute scale has been used in the analysis of FEV(1) changes 
      and may have led to sub-optimal statistical analysis in some cases. The choice 
      between the absolute and relative scale should be determined based on biological 
      reasoning and empirical testing to identify the scale that leads to lower 
      heterogeneity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In diabetic patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD), the 
      survival difference between coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and 
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) favors CABG. However, there are few data on 
      the mortality difference between the 2 strategies in nondiabetic patients. 
      OBJECTIVES: This study performed a patient-level meta-analysis to compare the effect 
      of CABG versus PCI with drug-eluting stents on long-term mortality in 1,275 
      nondiabetic patients with multivessel CAD. METHODS: Individual patient data from the 
      SYNTAX (Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) and the BEST (Randomized 
      Comparison of Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery and Everolimus-Eluting Stent 
      Implantation in the Treatment of Patients with Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease) 
      trials were pooled. The primary outcome was death from any cause. RESULTS: The 
      median follow-up time was 61 months (interquartile range: 50 months to 62 months). 
      The risk of death from any cause was significantly lower in the CABG group than in 
      the PCI group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43 to 0.98; 
      p = 0.039). A similar finding was observed for the risk of death from cardiac 
      causes. The superiority of CABG over PCI was consistent across the major clinical 
      subgroups. Likewise, the rate of myocardial infarction was remarkably lower after 
      CABG than after PCI (HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.65; p < 0.001). However, the rate 
      of stroke was not different between the 2 groups (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.59 to 2.17; 
      p = 0.714). The need for repeat revascularization was significantly lower in the 
      CABG group than in the PCI group (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.75; p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: CABG, as compared with PCI with drug-eluting stents, significantly 
      reduced the long-term risk of mortality in nondiabetic patients with multivessel 
      CAD.

TI  - Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable Recommendations for Individual Data 
      Pooling Analyses in Stroke.
PG  - 2154-9
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.012966 [doi]
AB  - Pooled analysis of individual patient data from stroke trials can deliver more 
      precise estimates of treatment effect, enhance power to examine prespecified 
      subgroups, and facilitate exploration of treatment-modifying influences. Analysis 
      plans should be declared, and preferably published, before trial results are known. 
      For pooling trials that used diverse analytic approaches, an ordinal analysis is 
      favored, with justification for considering deaths and severe disability jointly. 
      Because trial pooling is an incremental process, analyses should follow a sequential 
      approach, with statistical adjustment for iterations. Updated analyses should be 
      published when revised conclusions have a clinical implication. However, caution is 
      recommended in declaring pooled findings that may prejudice ongoing trials, unless 
      clinical implications are compelling. All contributing trial teams should contribute 
      to leadership, data verification, and authorship of pooled analyses. Development 
      work is needed to enable reliable inferences to be drawn about individual drug or 
      device effects that contribute to a pooled analysis, versus a class effect, if the 
      treatment strategy combines ≥2 such drugs or devices. Despite the practical 
      challenges, pooled analyses are powerful and essential tools in interpreting 
      clinical trial findings and advancing clinical care.

AB  - The association between body mass index (BMI) and major clinical events after acute 
      coronary syndrome (ACS) remains controversial. We investigated the impact of BMI on 
      major clinical events after ACS in a large individual patient data meta-analysis. 
      Data on 81,553 patients from 45 different countries with ACS enrolled in 8 large 
      randomized clinical trials were included, followed up for a median of 171 days. The 
      mean age was 63.4 ± 11.7, 70% were male, and the mean BMI was 27.3 ± 4.7 kg/m(2). 
      Compared with upper-normal-weight participants (BMI 21.75 to 24.9 kg/m(2), reference 
      category), underweight participants (<18.5 kg/m(2)) had an increased risk of death 
      (hazard ratio [HR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10 to 1.66, p = 0.004). Both 
      overweight subcategories, BMI 25 to 27.5 kg/m(2) (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89, 
      p <0.001) and BMI 27.5 to 29.9 kg/m(2) (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92, p <0.001), and 
      type I obesity (30 to 34.9, HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.89, p <0.001) had a 
      significantly lower mortality. Type II and III obesities were not significantly 
      associated with mortality. Mortality was lowest at a BMI of 30.9 kg/m(2). Compared 
      with normal-weight patients, overweight and obese categories were related with a 
      significantly lower risk of bleeding and refractory ischemia. Overweight patients 
      had a lower risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalizations, and heart 
      failure-related deaths. There were no associations between BMI and revascularization 
      rates or stroke. In conclusion, underweight and normal-weight patients were 
      associated with an increased mortality risk, bleeding, ischemia, and heart failure 
      compared with those with higher BMI after ACS.

AB  - Our aim was to review the studies which assessed potential surrogate endpoints for 
      overall survival (OS) in breast cancer trials. A Literature search in PubMed 
      database of studies which assessed potential surrogate endpoints for OS in breast 
      cancer trials was conducted. The surrogacy was assessed with the German institute of 
      Quality and efficiency in Health Care's (IWQiG) framework and the Fleming hierarchy. 
      Thirteen studies were identified. At the neoadjuvant setting, two individual patient 
      data (IPD) meta-analyses and one aggregate data meta-analysis assessing surrogacy of 
      pathological complete response (PCR) were identified. Trial-level association was 
      calculated in one study and the squared correlation was 0.24. Therefore PCR was not 
      judged to be valid surrogate for OS at the neoadjuvant setting according to the 
      IWQiG framework and Fleming hierarchy. At the adjuvant setting, one meta-analysis on 
      aggregate data was identified. 2-year DFS was not judged to be valid surrogate for 
      OS at the neoadjuvant setting according to the IWQiG framework and Fleming 
      hierarchy. At the metastatic setting, six meta-analyses based on aggregate data, 
      three IPD meta-analyses and one retrospective study were identified. Within the IPD 
      meta-analyses, at the trial-level association the squared correlation between the 
      potential surrogates and OS ranged from 0.10 to 0.57 and no endpoint was judged to 
      be valid surrogate for OS at the metastatic setting. The level of evidence available 
      supporting a relationship between OS and potential surrogate endpoints in breast 
      cancer trials is low.

TI  - Intravenous high-dose interferon with or without maintenance treatment in melanoma 
      at high risk of recurrence: meta-analysis of three trials.
PG  - 17-23
LID - 10.1002/cam4.563 [doi]
AB  - Resected stage IIB-IIIC malignant melanoma has a poor prognosis with a high risk of 
      relapse and death. Treatment with adjuvant interferon alfa-2b (IFN-α-2b) is 
      associated with improved relapse-free and overall survivals (OS), but the most 
      appropriate dose and duration of treatment are unknown. In this article, we present 
      an individual patient data random effects meta-analysis of melanoma patients from 
      the U.K., Greek, and Chinese randomized trials. All patients were randomized either 
      to IFN-α-2b 15-20 MIU/m(2) IV daily 5 days per week for 4 weeks (IV) or to the same 
      regimen followed by IFN-α-2b 9-10 MIU/m(2) administered three times per week for 48 
      weeks (IV and SC). Allowing for dose interruptions and reductions, an equivalent 
      total dose of IFN-α-2b was delivered in all three studies. We assessed whether IV 
      was noninferior to IV and SC in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS) and 
      investigated tumor and patient characteristics that impacted on outcomes. Median 
      follow-up of 716 stage IIB-IIIC patients was 5.4 years. Noninferiority of IV 
      compared to IV and SC could not be conferred for RFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.52; noninferior P = 0.17). Stage (P < 0.0001), site 
      (acral vs. other, P < 0.0001), and Breslow thickness (P = 0.02) were significant 
      predictors of RFS. The HR for death was 1.13 for IV compared to IV and SC, (95% CI 
      0.91-1.39). Stage (P < 0.0001) and Breslow thickness (P = 0.001) were significant 
      independent predictors of OS. The available data suggest that where adjuvant 
      high-dose interferon is being considered there is no evidence to deviate from the 
      year long regimen described in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and Intergroup 
      studies.

TI  - Left ventricular ejection fraction and adjudicated, cause-specific hospitalizations 
      after myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure or left ventricular

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after acute myocardial 
      infarction (MI) increases risk of cardiovascular (CV) hospitalizations, but evidence 
      regarding its association with non-CV outcome is scarce. We investigated the 
      association between LVEF and adjudicated cause-specific hospitalizations following 
      MI complicated with low LVEF or overt heart failure (HF). METHODS: In an individual 
      patient data meta-analysis of 19,740 patients from 3 large randomized trials, Fine 
      and Gray competing risk modeling was performed to study the association between LVEF 
      and hospitalization types. RESULTS: The most common cause of hospitalization was 
      non-CV (n = 2,368 for HF, n = 1,554 for MI, and n = 3,703 for non-CV). All types of 
      hospitalizations significantly increased with decreasing LVEF. The absolute risk 
      increase associated with LVEF ≪25% (vs LVEF ≫35%) was 15.5% (95% CI 13.4-17.5) for 
      HF, 4.7% (95% CI 3.0-6.4) for MI, and 10.4% (95% CI 8.0-12.8) for non-CV 
      hospitalization. On a relative scale, after adjusting for confounders, each 5-point 
      decrease in LVEF was associated with an increased risk of HF (hazard ratio [HR] 
      1.15, 95% CI 1.12-1.18), MI (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.10), and non-CV hospitalization 
      (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05). CONCLUSIONS: In a high-risk population with complicated 
      acute MI, the absolute risk increase in non-CV hospitalizations associated with LVEF 
      ≪25% was two thirds of the absolute risk increase in HF hospitalizations and twice 
      the absolute risk increase in MI hospitalizations. LVEF was an independent predictor 
      of all types of hospitalization and appears as an integrative marker of sicker 
      patient status.

TI  - Covariate-adjusted measures of discrimination for survival data.
PG  - 592-613
LID - 10.1002/bimj.201400061 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Discrimination statistics describe the ability of a survival model to 
      assign higher risks to individuals who experience earlier events: examples are 
      Harrell's C-index and Royston and Sauerbrei's D, which we call the D-index. 
      Prognostic covariates whose distributions are controlled by the study design (e.g. 
      age and sex) influence discrimination and can make it difficult to compare model 
      discrimination between studies. Although covariate adjustment is a standard 
      procedure for quantifying disease-risk factor associations, there are no covariate 
      adjustment methods for discrimination statistics in censored survival data. 
      OBJECTIVE: To develop extensions of the C-index and D-index that describe the 
      prognostic ability of a model adjusted for one or more covariate(s). METHOD: We 
      define a covariate-adjusted C-index and D-index for censored survival data, propose 
      several estimators, and investigate their performance in simulation studies and in 
      data from a large individual participant data meta-analysis, the Emerging Risk 
      Factors Collaboration. RESULTS: The proposed methods perform well in simulations. In 
      the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration data, the age-adjusted C-index and D-index 
      were substantially smaller than unadjusted values. The study-specific standard 
      deviation of baseline age was strongly associated with the unadjusted C-index and 
      D-index but not significantly associated with the age-adjusted indices. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The proposed estimators improve meta-analysis comparisons, are easy to implement and 
      give a more meaningful clinical interpretation.

TI  - Predictors of Outcome in Conservative and Minimally Invasive Surgical Management of 
      Pain Originating From the Sacroiliac Joint: A Pooled Analysis.
PG  - 1664-1673
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000002169 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A pooled patient-level analysis of two multicenter randomized 
      controlled trials and one multicenter single-arm prospective trial. OBJECTIVE: The 
      aim of this study was to identify predictors of outcome of conservative and 
      minimally invasive surgical management of pain originating from the sacroiliac joint 
      (SIJ). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Three recently published prospective trials have 
      shown that minimally invasive SIJ fusion (SIJF) using triangular titanium implants 
      produces better outcomes than conservative management for patients with pain 
      originating from the SIJ. Due to limitations in individual trial sample size, 
      analyses of predictors of treatment outcome were not conducted. METHODS: We pooled 
      individual patient data from the three trials and used random effects models with 
      multivariate regression analysis to identify predictors for treatment outcome 
      separately for conservative and minimally invasive surgical treatment. Outcome was 
      measured using visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and 
      EuroQOL-5D (EQ-5D). RESULTS: We included 423 patients assigned to either nonsurgical 
      management (NSM, n = 97) or SIJF (n = 326) between 2013 and 2015. The reduction in 
      SIJ pain was 37.9 points larger [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 32.5-43.4, 
      P < 0.0001] in the SIJF group than in the NSM group. Similarly, the improvement in 
      ODI was 18.3 points larger (95% CI 14.3-22.4), P < 0.0001). In NSM, we found no 
      predictors of outcome. In SIJF, a reduced improvement in outcome was predicted by 
      smoking (P = 0.030), opioid use (P = 0.017), lower patient age (P = 0.008), and 
      lower duration of SIJ pain (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the view 
      that SIJF leads to better treatment outcome than conservative management of SIJ pain 
      and that a higher margin of improvement can be predicted in nonsmokers, nonopioid 
      users, and patients of increased age and with longer pain duration. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: 1.

TI  - The effects of atomoxetine on emotional control in adults with ADHD: An integrated 
      analysis of multicenter studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of atomoxetine on emotional control in adults 
      with ADHD. METHODS: We performed an integrated analysis using individual patient 
      data pooled from three Eli Lilly-sponsored studies. An integrated analysis can be 
      viewed as a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data, rather than study-level 
      summary data. RESULTS: Two populations were identified: a large sample of patients 
      with pre-treatment baseline data (the "overall population"; n=2846); and a subset of 
      these patients with placebo-controlled efficacy data from baseline to 10 or 12 weeks 
      after initiating treatment (the "placebo-controlled population"; n=829). At 
      baseline, in the overall population, ∼50% of ADHD patients had BRIEF-AS (Behavior 
      Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version Self-Report) Emotional control 
      subscores between 21 and 30, compared with ∼10% of normative subjects in the BRIEF-A 
      manual. At endpoint, in the placebo-controlled population, atomoxetine led to a 
      small (effect size 0.19) but significant (P=0.013) treatment effect for emotional 
      control. The effect size was 0.32 in patients with BRIEF-AS Emotional control 
      scores>20 at baseline. Improvements in emotional control correlated with 
      improvements in the core ADHD symptoms and quality-of-life. DISCUSSION: As deficient 
      emotional control is associated with impaired social, educational and occupational 
      functioning over and above that explained by core ADHD symptoms alone, improvements 
      in emotional control may be clinically relevant. CONCLUSION: At baseline, adults 
      with ADHD were more likely to have impaired emotional control than normative 
      subjects. In the adult ADHD patients, atomoxetine treatment was associated with 
      improvements in emotional control, as well as in core ADHD symptoms and 
      quality-of-life.

TI  - Severity of Hypoxemia and Effect of High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation in Acute 
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
PG  - 727-733
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201609-1938OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is theoretically beneficial 
      for lung protection, but the results of clinical trials are inconsistent, with 
      study-level meta-analyses suggesting no significant effect on mortality. OBJECTIVES: 
      The aim of this individual patient data meta-analysis was to identify acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patient subgroups with differential outcomes 
      from HFOV. METHODS: After a comprehensive search for trials, two reviewers 
      independently identified randomized trials comparing HFOV with conventional 
      ventilation for adults with ARDS. Prespecified effect modifiers were tested using 
      multivariable hierarchical logistic regression models, adjusting for important 
      prognostic factors and clustering effects. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data from 
      1,552 patients in four trials were analyzed, applying uniform definitions for study 
      variables and outcomes. Patients had a mean baseline Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) of 114 ± 39 
      mm Hg; 40% had severe ARDS (Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) <100 mm Hg). Mortality at 30 days was 
      321 of 785 (40.9%) for HFOV patients versus 288 of 767 (37.6%) for control subjects 
      (adjusted odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.46; P = 0.16). This 
      treatment effect varied, however, depending on baseline severity of hypoxemia 
      (P = 0.0003), with harm increasing with Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) among patients with 
      mild-moderate ARDS, and the possibility of decreased mortality in patients with very 
      severe ARDS. Compliance and body mass index did not modify the treatment effect. 
      HFOV increased barotrauma risk compared with conventional ventilation (adjusted odds 
      ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.96; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: HFOV 
      increases mortality for most patients with ARDS but may improve survival among 
      patients with severe hypoxemia on conventional mechanical ventilation.

TI  - Percutaneous versus traditional and paraspinal posterior open approaches for 
      treatment of thoracolumbar fractures without neurologic deficit: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 1418-1431
LID - 10.1007/s00586-016-4818-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated differences in outcome variables between percutaneous, 
      traditional, and paraspinal posterior open approaches for traumatic thoracolumbar 
      fractures without neurologic deficit. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, 
      Cochrane, and Embase was performed. In this meta-analysis, we conducted online 
      searches of PubMed, Cochrane, Embase using the search terms "thoracolumbar 
      fractures", "lumbar fractures", ''percutaneous'', "minimally invasive", ''open", 
      "traditional", "posterior", "conventional", "pedicle screw", "sextant", and 
      "clinical trial". The analysis was performed on individual patient data from all the 
      studies that met the selection criteria. Clinical outcomes were expressed as risk 
      difference for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes with 
      95 % confidence interval. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ (2) test and I (2) 
      statistics. RESULTS: There were 4 randomized controlled trials and 14 observational 
      articles included in this analysis. Percutaneous approach was associated with better 
      ODI score, less Cobb angle correction, less Cobb angle correction loss, less 
      postoperative VBA correction, and lower infection rate compared with open approach. 
      Percutaneous approach was also associated with shorter operative duration, longer 
      intraoperative fluoroscopy, less postoperative VAS, and postoperative VBH% in 
      comparison with traditional open approach. No significant difference was found in 
      Cobb angle correction, postoperative VBA, VBA correction loss, Postoperative VBH%, 
      VBH correction loss, and pedicle screw misplacement between percutaneous approach 
      and open approach. There was no significant difference in operative duration, 
      intraoperative fluoroscopy, postoperative VAS, and postoperative VBH% between 
      percutaneous approach and paraspianl approach. CONCLUSIONS: The functional and the 
      radiological outcome of percutaneous approach would be better than open approach in 
      the long term. Although trans-muscular spatium approach belonged to open fixation 
      methods, it was strictly defined as less invasive approach, which provided less 
      injury to the paraspinal muscles and better reposition effect.

TI  - Changes in Proteinuria and Side Effects of Corticosteroids Alone or in Combination 
      with Azathioprine at Different Stages of IgA Nephropathy.
PG  - 973-81
LID - 10.2215/CJN.02300215 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Time-average proteinuria (TAp) is the strongest predictor 
      of renal survival in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Little is known about the utility and 
      safety of corticosteroids (CS) to obtain TAp<1 g/d in patients with advanced IgAN. 
      This study sought to evaluate TAp at different degree of baseline renal function and 
      histologic severity during CS use and to investigate treatment safety. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We performed one-stage individual-patient 
      data meta-analysis among 325 patients with IgAN enrolled in three prospective, 
      randomized clinical trials. Patients were divided into three groups according to 
      treatment: no treatment (NT; supportive therapy), CS, and CS plus azathioprine 
      (CS+A). Associations of TAp with histologic grading, treatment, and eGFR at baseline 
      were performed with linear regression models for repeated measures. The median 
      follow-up duration was 66.6 months (range, 12-144 months). RESULTS: In the first 6 
      months, proteinuria did not change in the NT group and decreased substantially in 
      the other groups(CS: from a mean±SD of 2.20±1.0 to 0.8 [interquartile range, 
      0.4-1.2] g/d; CS+A: from 2.876±2.1 to 1.0 [interquartile range, 0.5-1.7] g/d), 
      independent of the degree of histologic damage and baseline eGFR. The percentage of 
      patients who maintained TAp<1 g/d was 30.2% in the NT, 67.3% in the CS, and 66.6% in 
      the CS+A group. Thirty-four patients experienced adverse events: none in the NT, 11 
      (6.4%) in the CS, and 23 (20.7%) in the CS+A group. The risk of developing adverse 
      events increased with decreasing levels of eGFR (from 2.3% to 15.4%). The addition 
      of azathioprine to CS further increased the percentage of patients with adverse 
      events (16.8% versus 5.7% in study 2 and 30.0% versus 15.4% in study 3; overall 
      P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IgAN, CS can reduce proteinuria and increase 
      the possibility of maintaining TAp<1 g/d, regardless of the stage of CKD and the 
      histologic damage. The risk of major adverse events is low in patients with normal 
      renal function but increases in those with impaired renal function and with the 
      addition of azathioprine.

TI  - Comparison of Treatment Response in Idiopathic and Connective Tissue 
      Disease-associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.
PG  - 1111-7
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201507-1456OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Studies suggest that patients with connective tissue disease-associated 
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (CTD-PAH) have a poorer treatment response to 
      therapies for PAH compared with patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH), but individual 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been underpowered to examine differences 
      within these subgroups. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of therapy for PAH in 
      CTD-PAH versus IPAH. METHODS: We obtained individual participant data from phase III 
      placebo-controlled RCTs of therapies for PAH submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration for drug approval. A treatment-by-diagnosis interaction term 
      evaluated differences in treatment response between CTD-PAH and IPAH. Outcomes 
      included change in 6-minute-walk distance (∆6MWD) from baseline to 12 weeks, 
      clinical worsening, and all-cause mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The 
      study sample included 827 participants with CTD-PAH and 1,935 with IPAH from 11 
      RCTs. Patients with CTD-PAH had less improvement in 6MWD when assigned to active 
      treatment versus placebo compared with patients with IPAH (difference in treatment 
      effect on ∆6MWD in CTD-PAH vs. IPAH, -17.3 m; 90% confidence interval, -31.3 to 
      -3.3; P for interaction = 0.043). Treatment was less effective in reducing the 
      occurrence of clinical worsening in CTD-PAH versus IPAH (P for interaction = 0.012), 
      but there was no difference in the placebo-adjusted effect of treatment on mortality 
      (P for interaction = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for PAH was less effective in 
      CTD-PAH compared with IPAH in terms of increasing 6MWD and preventing clinical 
      worsening. The heterogeneity of treatment response supports the need for identifying 
      therapies that are more effective for CTD-PAH.

      Nocturnal Hypoglycemia.
PG  - 602-609
LID - 10.1089/dia.2019.0119 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate the effectiveness of predictive low glucose suspend (PLGS) systems 
      within sensor-augmented insulin infusion pumps at preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia 
      in patients with type 1 diabetes (DM1), we performed a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of randomized crossover trials. Pubmed and Google Scholar were 
      searched for randomized crossover trials, published between January 2013 and July 
      2018, in nonpregnant outpatients with DM1, which compared event rates during PLGS 
      overnight periods and non-PLGS overnight periods. The primary outcome was the 
      proportion of overnight periods with one or more hypoglycemic measurement. When 
      available, individual patient data were used to assess the effect of clustering 
      measurements within patients. Four studies (272 patients, 10,735 patient-nights: 
      5422 PLGS and 5313 non-PLGS) were included in the meta-analysis. Two studies 
      reported patient-level data that permitted assessment of the effect of clustering 
      measurements within patients. The effect on the risk difference was minimal. The 
      proportion of overnight periods with one or more episodes of hypoglycemia was 19.6% 
      for the PLGS periods and 27.8% for the non-PLGS periods. Based on the pooled 
      estimate, PLGS overnight periods were associated with an 8.8% lower risk of 
      hypoglycemia (risk difference -0.088; 95% CI -0.119 to -0.056, I(2) = 67.4%, 
      τ(2) = 0.0006, 4 studies). PLGS systems can reduce nocturnal hypoglycemic events in 
      patients with DM1.

TI  - Are adjuvant bisphosphonates now standard of care of women with early stage breast 
      cancer? A debate from the Canadian Bone and the Oncologist New Updates meeting.
PG  - 54-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jbo.2015.06.001 [doi]
AB  - The 9th Bone and the Oncologist New Updates conference was held in Ottawa, Canada 
      during 2014. This annual meeting focuses on innovative research into the mechanisms 
      and consequences of treatment-induced and metastatic bone disease. Given the recent 
      presentation of the Oxford overview's "Effects of bisphosphonate treatment on 
      recurrence and cause-specific mortality in women with early breast cancer: A 
      meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized trials" at the San Antonio 
      Breast Cancer Symposium, a debate as to the pro's and con's of adjuvant 
      bisphosphonate use in early stage breast cancer was undertaken. As bisphosphonate 
      treatment in post-menopausal women appeared to demonstrate a similar magnitude of 
      benefit to that of other commonly used adjuvant strategies the debate assessed 
      whether or not there was sufficient data to incorporate adjuvant bisphosphonates 
      into standard practice and if so, in which patient populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To critically appraise published network meta-analyses (NMAs) evaluating 
      the efficacy or safety of the new oral anticogulants (NOACs) dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, and apixaban for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to 
      identify the relevant NMAs using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Database of 
      Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Health Technology Assessment. The synthesis 
      studies were evaluated using the "Questionnaire to assess the relevance and 
      credibility of the NMA." RESULTS: Eleven NMAs evaluating NOACs among adults with 
      nonvalvular AF were identified. Most NMAs included three large phase III randomized 
      controlled trials, comparing NOACs to adjusted-dose warfarin (Randomized Evaluation 
      of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy [RE-LY], Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct 
      Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and 
      Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation [ROCKET-AF], and Apixaban for Reduction of 
      Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation [ARISTOTLE]). The main 
      differences identified related to potential treatment effect modifiers regarding the 
      mean time spent in therapeutic range (TTR) in the warfarin arm, the risk of stroke 
      or systemic embolism across the trials (mean CHADS2 score: C = congestive heart 
      failure, H = hypertension, A = older than age 75 years, D = diabetes mellitus, S2 = 
      prior stroke or history of transient ischemic attack) or primary versus secondary 
      prevention, and type of populations used in the analysis. Kansal et al. [Kansal AR, 
      Sharma M, Bradley-Kennedy C, et al. Dabigatran versus rivaroxaban for the prevention 
      of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation in Canada: comparative 
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Thromb Haemost 2012;108:672-82] appropriately 
      adjusted the ROCKET-AF TTR to match the RE-LY population on the basis of individual 
      patient data. Meta-regressions are not expected to minimize confounding bias given 
      limited data, whereas subgroup analyses had some impact on the point estimates for 
      the treatment comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the synthesis studies were 
      generally comparable and suggested that the NOACs had similar efficacy, although 
      some differences were identified depending on the outcome. The extent to which 
      differences in the distribution of TTR, CHADS2 score, or primary versus secondary 
      prevention biased the results remains unclear.

TI  - Mortality reduction by post-dilution online-haemodiafiltration: a cause-specific 
      analysis.
PG  - 548-555
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfw381 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: From an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis from four 
      randomized controlled trials comparing haemodialysis (HD) with post-dilution 
      online-haemodiafiltration (ol-HDF), previously it appeared that HDF decreases 
      all-cause mortality by 14% (95% confidence interval 25; 1) and fatal cardiovascular 
      disease (CVD) by 23% (39; 3). Significant differences were not found for fatal 
      infections and sudden death. So far, it is unclear, however, whether the reduced 
      mortality risk of HDF is only due to a decrease in CVD events and if so, which CVD 
      in particular is prevented, if compared with HD. METHODS: The IPD base was used for 
      the present study. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for cause-specific 
      mortality overall and in thirds of the convection volume were calculated using the 
      Cox proportional hazard regression models. Annualized mortality and numbers needed 
      to treat (NNT) were calculated as well. RESULTS: Besides 554 patients dying from 
      CVD, fatal infections and sudden death, 215 participants died from 'other causes', 
      such as withdrawal from treatment and malignancies. In this group, the mortality 
      risk was comparable between HD and ol-HDF patients, both overall and in thirds of 
      the convection volume. Subdivision of CVD mortality in fatal cardiac, non-cardiac 
      and unclassified CVD showed that ol-HDF was only associated with a lower risk of 
      cardiac casualties [0.64 (0.61; 0.90)]. Annual mortality rates also suggest that the 
      reduction in CVD death is mainly due to a decrease in cardiac fatalities, including 
      both ischaemic heart disease and congestion. Overall, 32 and 75 patients, 
      respectively, need to be treated by high-volume HDF (HV-HDF) to prevent one 
      all-cause and one CVD death, respectively, per year. CONCLUSION: The beneficial 
      effect of ol-HDF on all-cause and CVD mortality appears to be mainly due to a 
      reduction in fatal cardiac events, including ischaemic heart disease as well as 
      congestion. In HV-HDF, the NNT to prevent one CVD death is 75 per year.

TI  - Transdermal testosterone pretreatment in poor responders undergoing ICSI: a 
      randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 977-85
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dew028 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does pretreatment with transdermal testosterone increase the number 
      of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) retrieved by more than 1.5 in poor responders 
      undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), using recombinant follicle 
      stimulating hormone (FSH) and gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa)? 
      SUMMARY ANSWER: Testosterone pretreatment failed to increase the number of COCs by 
      more than 1.5 as compared with no pretreatment in poor responders undergoing ICSI 
      (difference between medians: 0.0, 95% CI: -1.0 to +1.0). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: 
      Androgens are thought to play an important role in early follicular development by 
      enhancing ovarian sensitivity to FSH. In a recent meta-analysis, testosterone 
      pretreatment resulted in an increase of 1.5 COCs as compared with no pretreatment. 
      However, this effect was based on the analysis of only two randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) including 163 patients. Evidently, there is a need for additional RCTs 
      that will allow firmer conclusions to be drawn. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The 
      present RCT was designed to detect a difference of 1.5 COCs (sample size required = 
      48 patients). From 02/2014 until 04/2015, 50 poor responders fulfilling the Bologna 
      criteria have been randomized (using a randomization list) to either testosterone 
      pretreatment for 21 days ( ITALIC! n = 26) or no pretreatment ( ITALIC! n = 24). 
      PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All patients underwent a long follicular 
      GnRHa protocol. Recombinant FSH stimulation was started on Day 22 following GnRHa 
      initiation. In the testosterone pretreatment group, a daily dose of 10 mg of 
      testosterone gel was applied transdermally for 21 days starting from GnRHa 
      initiation. Results are expressed as median (interquartile range). MAIN RESULTS AND 
      THE ROLE OF CHANCE: No differences in baseline characteristics were observed between 
      the two groups compared. Testosterone levels [median (interquartile range)] were 
      significantly higher in the testosterone pretreatment on the day of initiation of 
      FSH stimulation [114 (99.5) ng/dl versus 20 (20) ng/dl, respectively, ITALIC! P < 
      0.001]. Duration of FSH stimulation [median (interquartile range)] was similar 
      between the groups compared [12.5 (3.0) days versus 12 (3.0) days, respectively, 
      ITALIC! P = 0.52]. The number of COCs retrieved [median (interquartile range)] was 
      not different between the testosterone pretreatment and the no pretreatment groups 
      [3.5 (4.0) versus 3.0 (3.0), 95% CI for the median: 2.0-5.0 versus 2.7-4.3, 
      respectively; difference between medians: 0.0, 95% CI: +1.0 to -1.0). Similarly no 
      differences were observed regarding fertilization rates [median (interquartile 
      range)] [66.7% (32.5) versus 66.7% (42.9), respectively, ITALIC! P = 0.97] and live 
      birth rates per randomized patient (7.7% versus 8.3%, respectively, rate difference: 
      -0.6%, 95% CI: -19.0 to +16.9). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The study was not 
      powered to detect differences less than 1.5 COCs, although it is doubtful whether 
      these differences would be clinically relevant. Moreover, due to sample size 
      restrictions, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the probability of live birth. 
      WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The results of this randomized clinical trial, 
      suggesting that pretreatment with 10 mg of transdermal testosterone for 21 days does 
      not improve ovarian response by more than 1.5 oocytes, could be used to more 
      accurately consult patients with poor ovarian response. However, an improvement in 
      IVF outcome using a higher dose of testosterone or a longer pretreatment period 
      cannot be excluded. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST: The study was partially funded 
      by a Scholarship from the Academy of Athens. C.A.V. reports personal fees and

      Neuropathy Treated With the 8% Capsaicin Patch (Qutenza).
PG  - 859-66
LID - 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000186 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Qutenza is a high-dose capsaicin patch used to relieve neuropathic pain 
      from postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and HIV-associated neuropathy (HIV-AN). In 
      clinical studies, some patients had a dramatic response to the capsaicin patch. Our 
      objective was to determine the baseline characteristics of patients who best benefit 
      from capsaicin patch treatment. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of 6 completed 
      randomized and controlled Qutenza studies by pooling individual patient data. 
      Sustained response was defined as>50% decrease in the mean pain intensity from 
      baseline to weeks 2 to 12, and Complete Response as an average pain intensity 
      score≤1 during weeks 2 to 12. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of 
      response and Complete Response, and subgroups of patients who respond best to the 
      capsaicin patch. RESULTS: Baseline pain intensity score (BPIS)≤4 was a predictor of 
      Sustained and Complete Response in PHN and HIV-AN patients; absence of allodynia and 
      presence of hypoesthesia, and a McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) sensory score <22 
      were predictors of Sustained Response in PHN patients; female sex was a predictor of 
      Sustained and Complete Response in HIV-AN patients. Thus, characteristics associated 
      with the highest chance of responding to the capsaicin patch were, for PHN, BPIS≤4, 
      MPQ sensory score≤22, absence of allodynia, and presence of hypoesthesia; for 
      HIV-AN, they were female sex and BPIS≤4. Patients with these characteristics had a 
      statistically significantly greater chance of responding to the capsaicin patch than 
      other patients. DISCUSSION: We identified subpopulations of PHN and HIV-AN patients 
      likely to benefit from the capsaicin patch.

TI  - A comparison of low versus standard heparin dose for prevention of forearm artery 
      occlusion after 5 French coronary angiography.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radial artery occlusion (RAO) remains the Achilles' heel of transradial 
      coronary procedures. Standard over lower systemic anticoagulation levels are 
      believed to reduce RAO rates but this is ill-supported by scientific evidence. We 
      compared whether standard in comparison with less intensive anticoagulation was 
      superior in preventing vessel closure. METHODS AND RESULTS: The two arms of this 
      analysis included 731 pooled patients with the same inclusion and exclusion 
      criteria. We assessed forearm arterial access site occlusion rate by unfractionated 
      heparin (UFH) dose in an individual participant data meta-analysis of this 
      randomized study and of consecutive eligible patients from our previous trial. We 
      randomized 308 consecutive patients undergoing transradial coronary angiography with 
      5 French (5 Fr) catheters without need to crossover to receive 2500 or 5000 UFH 
      units. The primary end-point was the ultrasonographically determined vessel 
      occlusion rate. Incident RAOs in the randomized arm were 15.9% vs. 14%, in the low 
      and standard UFH dose, respectively (p=0.7). Corresponding figures for forearm 
      arterial occlusion rates in the pooled population were 13.0% vs. 9.9% (relative 
      risk: 1.3, 95% confidence interval - CI: 0.88-1.98; p=0.2). Procedural and 
      fluoroscopy duration was less than 15 and 3 min, respectively. The mean UFH dose 
      difference was 3.52 (95% CI: -0.45 to 7.49) units per kilo body weight between 
      occluded (n=84) and patent forearm arteries (n=647); (p=0.053). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Incident forearm arterial occlusions were high despite using 5 Fr catheters for a 
      short-lasting procedure. Systemic anticoagulation with standard over lower UFH dose 
      did not reduce the frequency of RAOs after coronary angiography.

TI  - Can we convert between outcome measures of disability for chronic low back pain?
PG  - 734-9
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000000866 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database analysis. OBJECTIVE: A range of 
      patient-reported outcomes were used to measure disability due to low back pain. 
      There is not a single back pain disability measurement commonly used in all 
      randomized controlled trials. We report here our assessment as to whether different 
      disability measures are sufficiently comparable to allow data pooling across trials. 
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: We used individual patient data from a repository of 
      data from back pain trials of therapist-delivered interventions. METHODS: We used 
      data from 11 trials (n=6089 patients) that had at least 2 of the following 7 
      measurements: Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, Chronic Pain Grade disability 
      score, Physical Component Summary of the 12- or 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, 
      Patient Specific Functional Scale, Pain Disability Index, Oswestry Disability Index, 
      and Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire. Within each trial, the change score 
      between baseline and short-term follow-up was computed for each outcome and this was 
      used to calculate the correlation between the change scores and the Cohen's κ for 
      the 3-level outcome of change score of less than, equal to, and more than zero. It 
      was considered feasible to pool 2 measures if they were at least moderately 
      correlated (correlation>0.5) and have at least moderately similar responsiveness 
      (κ>0.4). RESULTS: Although all pairs of measures were found to be positively 
      correlated, most correlations were less than 0.5, with only 1 pair of outcomes in 1 
      trial having a correlation of more than 0.6. All κ statistics were less than 0.4 so 
      that in no cases were the criteria for acceptability of pooling measures satisfied. 
      CONCLUSION: The lack of agreement between different outcome measures means that 
      pooling of data on these different disability measurements in a meta-analysis is not 
      recommended. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.

      Post-hoc analysis of the SPACE Collaboration dataset.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fixed dose combinations of cardiovascular therapy ('polypills') have now 
      been launched in several dozen countries. There is considerable clinical interest in 
      the effects of switching to polypill-based care from typical current treatment 
      regimens, especially if polypills contain components at sub-maximal dosage. METHODS: 
      The SPACE Collaboration includes three trials of polypill based care vs usual care 
      in patients with established CVD or at high calculated risk. Individual patient data 
      for 3140 trial participants were combined. Patients were categorized according to 
      the potency of the statin and the number of BP lowering medications they were taking 
      at baseline. Effects on adherence to anti-platelet medication, systolic blood 
      pressure (SBP) and LDL cholesterol stratified by baseline potency of medication were 
      determined using fixed effects models. RESULTS: Randomisation to the polypill group 
      was associated with improved SBP at 12months, but this improvement varied according 
      to baseline BP regimen: -3.3, -5.9, -2.5 and +1mmHg for patients taking 0, 1, 2 and 
      3+ BP lowering medications at baseline. For changes in LDL cholesterol at 12months, 
      significant improvements in LDL cholesterol were seen for those taking no statin 
      (-0.21mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.34 to -0.07), less potent statin (-0.16mmol/L; 95% CI: 
      -0.29 to -0.04) and equipotent statins (-0.14mmol/L; 95% CI -0.26 to -0.02) at 
      baseline. CONCLUSION: The adherence benefits of polypills tend to offset the loss of 
      potency from use of individual components with lower dose potency, and to facilitate 
      improvements in multiple risk factors.

TI  - Is dibotermin alfa a cost-effective substitute for autologous iliac crest bone graft 
      in single level lumbar interbody spine fusion?
PG  - 2145-56
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2015.1092123 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of dibotermin alfa compared with 
      autologous iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) for patients undergoing single level lumbar 
      interbody spinal fusion in a UK hospital setting. METHODS: An individual patient 
      data (IPD) meta-analysis of six randomized controlled clinical trials and two single 
      arm trials compared dibotermin alfa on an absorbable collagen implantation matrix 
      (ACIM) (n = 456) and ICBG (n = 244) on resource use, re-operation rates, and SF-6D 
      (Short form 6-dimension) health utility (total N = 700). Failure-related second 
      surgery, operating time, post-operative hospital stay, and quality-adjusted life 
      years (QALYs) derived from the IPD meta-analysis were included as inputs in an 
      economic evaluation undertaken to assess the cost-effectiveness of dibotermin 
      alfa/ACIM versus ICBG for patients undergoing single level lumbar interbody spinal 
      fusion. A four year time horizon and the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service 
      (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective was adopted in the base case, 
      with sensitivity analyses performed to gauge parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: In the 
      base case analysis, patients treated using dibotermin alfa/ACIM (12 mg pack) accrued 
      0.055 incremental QALYs at an incremental cost of £ 737, compared with patients 
      treated with ICBG. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
      of £ 13,523, indicating that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £ 20,000, 
      dibotermin alfa/ACIM is a cost-effective intervention relative to ICBG from the NHS 
      and PSS perspective. CONCLUSIONS: In a UK hospital setting, dibotermin alfa/ACIM is 
      a cost-effective substitute for ICBG for patients who require lumbar interbody 
      arthrodesis.

TI  - Herbal medicine on cancer-related fatigue of lung cancer survivors: Protocol for a 
      systematic review.
PG  - e18968
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000018968 [doi]
LID - e18968
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and 
      approximately half of the patients with lung cancer receiving chemotherapy suffer 
      from cancer-related fatigue (CRF). Herbal medicines (HMs) have been used in Oriental 
      countries for centuries as tonics. Various beneficial effects of HM on fatigue and 
      cancer have been reported. However, the effectiveness and safety of HM for CRF in 
      lung cancer patients have not been synthesized. The purpose of this systematic 
      review is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of HM for CRF in patients with 
      lung cancer, regardless of their cancer type or stage. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A 
      comprehensive search will be conducted in 12 electronic medical databases including 
      5 English-language databases (Medline via PubMed, EMBASE via Elsevier, the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], the Allied and Complementary 
      Medicine Database [AMED] via EBSCO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
      Health Literature [CINAHL] via EBSCO), 4 Korean-language databases (Oriental 
      Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System [OASIS], Koreanstudies Information 
      Service System [KISS], Research Information Service System [RISS], and Korea 
      Citation Index [KCI]), 2 Chinese-language databases (China National Knowledge 
      Infrastructure [CNKI] and Wanfang Data), and 1 Japanese-language database (CiNii). 
      Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs on HM for CRF will be 
      allowed. The severity of fatigue assessed using a validated tool will be considered 
      as theprimary outcome. The secondary outcomes will include the patients' quality of 
      life, activities of daily life, incidence of adverse events, and total effective 
      rate. Two independent researchers will perform the study selection, data extraction, 
      and quality assessment. RevMan version 5.3 will be used for data synthesis. The 
      methodological quality of the included RCTs will be assessed using the Cochrane 
      Collaboration's risk of bias tool. In the meta-analysis, for dichotomous data and 
      continuous data, risk ratio and mean difference, respectively, will be estimated 
      with their 95% confidence intervals. According to the heterogeneity, either a 
      fixed-effects or a random-effects model will be used. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      Ethical approval is not required because individual patient data are not included. 
      The findings of this systematic review will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed 
      publication or conference presentation. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      CRD42019141660.

TI  - Survival following early-stage colon cancer: an ACCENT-based comparison of patients 
      versus a matched international general population†.
PG  - 950-958
LID - S0923-7534(19)31515-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdv073 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-treatment survival experience of early colon cancer (CC) patients 
      is well described in the literature, which states that cure is probable for some 
      patients. However, comparisons of treated patients' survival versus that expected 
      from a matched general population (MGP) are limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total 
      of 32 745 patients from 25 randomized adjuvant trials conducted from 1977 to 2012 in 
      41 countries were pooled. Observed long-term survival of these patients was compared 
      with expected survival matched on sex, age, country, and year, both overall and by 
      stage (II and III), sex, treatment [surgery, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5-FU + 
      oxaliplatin], age (<70 and 70+), enrollment year (pre/post 2000), and recurrence 
      (yes/no). Comparisons were made at randomization and repeated conditional on 
      survival to 1, 2, 3, and 5 years. CC and MGP equivalence was tested, and observed 
      Kaplan-Meier survival rates compared with expected MGP rates 3 years out from each 
      landmark. Analyses were also repeated in patients without recurrence. RESULTS: 
      Within most cohorts, long-term survival of CC patients remained statistically worse 
      than the MGP, though conditional survival generally improved over time. Among those 
      surviving 5 years, stage II, oxaliplatin-treated, elderly, and recurrence-free 
      patients achieved subsequent 3-year survival rates within 5% of the MGP, with 
      recurrence-free patients achieving equivalence. CONCLUSIONS: Conditional on survival 
      to 5 years, long-term survival of most CC patients on clinical trials remains 
      modestly poorer than an MGP, but achieves MGP levels in some subgroups. These 
      findings emphasize the need for access to quality care and improved treatment and 
      follow-up strategies.

TI  - Absence of adverse events in healthy individuals using probiotics--analysis of six 
      randomised studies by one study group.
PG  - 161-9
LID - 10.3920/BM2015.0096 [doi]
AB  - Consumption of live bacteria as probiotic supplements is increasing. There is, 
      however, a lack of information on the safety of ingested probiotics. The main 
      objective of this study was to investigate the adverse events (AEs) of specific 
      probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) alone or LGG in combination with L. 
      rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium freudenreichii JS, Bifidobacterium lactis BB12, 
      or Bifidobacterium breve 99) studied in six of our study groups' clinical trials, by 
      analysing individual participant data. A secondary objective was to study AEs 
      associated with the consumed probiotic species and mixtures in three specific 
      categories; 'gastrointestinal disorders', 'respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
      disorders' and 'infections and infestations'. Six randomised, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled clinical studies by our study group were included in this AE 
      analysis (study population n=1,909). All AE data were classified according to the 
      National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
      v4.0. From the 26 CTCAE System Organ Classes, we identified AEs in 20 classes among 
      1,909 subjects. Probiotic ingestion did not result in statistically significant 
      differences in AEs in different groups, when compared to placebo. A subgroup 
      analysis of gastrointestinal, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, 
      infections and infestations, found no differences between the intervention groups or 
      for different probiotic combinations (risk ratio (RR) = 0.97, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 0.93-1.02, P=0.30; RR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.01, P=0.35; RR=0.99, 95% 
      CI: 0.93-1.06, P=0.62, respectively). As a conclusion, ingestion of probiotic 
      supplementations containing LGG alone, or LGG in combination with L. rhamnosus 
      Lc705, P. freudenreichii JS, B. breve 99, or B. lactis BB12 did not seem to cause 
      AEs in young and elderly subjects in this analysis.

TI  - Efficacy comparison of duloxetine and SSRIs at doses approved in Japan.
PG  - 115-23
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S72642 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approved doses of antidepressants in Japan are usually lower than those 
      in the USA and European Union, but to date meta-analyses comparing antidepressants 
      have all used the higher doses approved in the USA and European Union and often have 
      used indirect comparisons. The purpose of this study was to conduct an integrated 
      database analysis of patient level data to compare the effects of duloxetine with 
      those of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at the doses approved in 
      Japan. METHODS: Pooled data were analyzed from four randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled studies that compared duloxetine at the dose range approved in 
      Japan (40-60 mg/day) with other SSRIs (paroxetine 20 mg/day or escitalopram 10 
      mg/day) and placebo in patients with major depressive disorder. In total, 1,694 
      patients were included in the analysis (duloxetine, n=688; selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors, n=690; placebo, n=316). The primary outcome measure was the 
      mean change from baseline at week 8 in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 
      (HAMD17) total and subscale scores. RESULTS: Duloxetine and both selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors were superior to placebo in HAMD17 total score at week 8 in both 
      the all-randomized group and the more severe subgroup (HAMD17 total scores ≥19). 
      Duloxetine was superior to SSRIs in improving the HAMD17 Retardation subscale score 
      (least squares mean difference [95% confidence interval]): all-randomized group, 
      -0.33 [-0.60, -0.07], P=0.015; severe subgroup, -0.45 [-0.83, -0.07], P=0.020). 
      CONCLUSION: Within the dose range approved in Japan for patients with major 
      depressive disorder, duloxetine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      demonstrated comparable overall efficacy, with a possible advantage for duloxetine 
      in improving loss of energy and interest. To the best of our knowledge, this 
      analysis is unique not only in evaluating dosages specific to Japan, but also in 
      using individual patient data and the same endpoint across studies to allow for 
      strictly direct head-to-head data comparisons as opposed to pooling direct and 
      indirect comparisons.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews should provide trustworthy guidance to 
      decision-makers, but their credibility is challenged by the selective reporting of 
      trial results and outcomes. Some trials are not published, and even among clinical 
      trials that are published partially (e.g., as conference abstracts), many are never 
      published in full. Although there are many potential sources of published and 
      unpublished data for systematic reviews, there are no established methods for 
      choosing among multiple reports or data sources about the same trial. METHODS: We 
      will conduct systematic reviews of the effectiveness and safety of two interventions 
      following the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines: (1) gabapentin for neuropathic 
      pain and (2) quetiapine for bipolar depression. For the review of gabapentin, we 
      will include adult participants with neuropathic pain who do not require ventilator 
      support. For the review of quetiapine, we will include adult participants with acute 
      bipolar depression (excluding mixed or rapid cycling episodes). We will compare 
      these drugs (used alone or in combination with other interventions) with placebo or 
      with the same intervention alone; direct comparisons with other medications will be 
      excluded. For each review, we will conduct highly sensitive electronic searches, and 
      the results of the searches will be assessed by two independent reviewers. Outcomes, 
      study characteristics, and risk of bias ratings will be extracted from multiple 
      reports by two individuals working independently, stored in a publicly available 
      database (Systematic Review Data Repository) and analyzed using commonly available 
      statistical software. In each review, we will conduct a series of meta-analyses 
      using data from different sources to determine how the results are affected by the 
      inclusion of data from multiple published sources (e.g., journal articles and 
      conference abstracts) as well as unpublished aggregate data (e.g., "clinical study 
      reports") and individual participant data (IPD). We will identify patient-centered 
      outcomes in each report and identify differences in the reporting of these outcomes 
      across sources. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: CRD42015014037 , CRD42015014038.

TI  - Laser-Assisted Uvulopalatoplasty for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Systematic Review 
      and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsx004 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) has been used as treatment 
      for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The objective of this study was to perform a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis for LAUP alone as treatment for OSA in adults. 
      METHODS: Three authors searched five databases (including PubMed/MEDLINE) from 
      inception through October 30, 2016 for peer-reviewed studies, with any 
      design/language. A study quality assessment tool was used. The PRISMA statement was 
      followed. A meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-three adult studies (717 
      patients) reported outcomes (age: 50 ± 9 years, body mass index: 29 ± 4 kg/m2). The 
      pre- and post-LAUP means (M) ± standard deviations (SDs) for apnea-hypopnea index 
      (AHI) were 28 ± 13 and 19 ± 12 events/h (32% reduction). Random effects modeling for 
      519 patients demonstrated an AHI mean difference (MD) of -6.56 [95% CI -10.14, 
      -2.97] events/h. Individual patient data analyses demonstrate a 23% success rate 
      (≥50% reduction in AHI and <20 events/h) and an 8% cure rate. Additionally, 44% of 
      patients had worsening of their AHI after LAUP. Lowest oxygen saturation (LSAT) 
      improved from a M ± SD of 80 ± 8% to 82 ± 7%. A limitation is that most studies were 
      case series studies and only two were randomized controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this meta-analysis, LAUP reduced AHI by 32% among all patients; while the LSAT only 
      changed minimally. Individual data demonstrated a success rate of 23%, cure rate of 
      8%, and worsening of the AHI among 44% of patients. We recommend that LAUP be 
      performed with caution or not performed at all given the unfavorable results of 
      currently published studies.

PG  - e15117
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000015117 [doi]
LID - e15117
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous clinical studies suggested that green tea extract (GTE) may 
      benefit patients with a variety of cancers. However, its efficacy is still 
      inconclusive. Thus, the objective of this study will systematically collate the 
      clinical studies testing its efficacy and safety for cancers. METHODS: We will 
      perform a systematic review of clinical studies assessing the efficacy of GTE in 
      variety of cancers. We will search Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      (CENTRAL), EMBASE, MEDILINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
      Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and Chinese 
      Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) using a comprehensive strategy. We will also 
      screen the reference lists of relevant studies to identify any additional studies 
      for potential inclusion. All databases will be searched up to February 1, 2019. All 
      eligible case-control studies and randomized controlled trials will be included in 
      this study. Two independent authors will review all searched literature. Upon 
      inclusion of trials, we will extract data by using a predefined standardized form. 
      The risk of bias assessment will be evaluated by using Cochrane risk of bias tool. 
      We will use RevMan 5.3 software to pool the data and carry out meta-analysis. 
      RESULTS: The primary outcome includes overall response rate. The secondary outcomes 
      comprise of overall survival, progression-free survival, the disease control rate, 
      and any adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will contribute to 
      the understanding of the efficacy of GTE in the setting of cancers and promote 
      future research of GTE in patients with cancers. DISSEMINATION AND ETHICS: The 
      results of this systematic review are expected to be published through peer-reviewed 
      journals. This study does not need ethic approval, because it does not utilize 
      individual patient data. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42019125111.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on 
      microvascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: a review protocol.
PG  - e020692
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020692 [doi]
LID - e020692
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a relatively 
      new drug-class of glucose-lowering medications. Several trials and systematic 
      reviews have demonstrated their beneficial effect on some macrovascular outcomes. 
      Their effect on microvascular outcomes has been reported as positive in several 
      trials, however, their effect remains uncertain. Therefore, we report the protocol 
      of a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at determining the effect of SGLT-2 
      inhibitors regarding patient-important and surrogate microvascular outcomes in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive search will be 
      conducted to find eligible articles from each database's earliest inception to 
      November 2017. These databases will include Ovid, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, 
      and Scopus. We will search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare any 
      of the SGLT-2 inhibitors with any other active treatment or placebo assessing 
      microvascular outcomes in either their primary or secondary outcomes. Reviewers 
      working independently and in duplicate will review all abstracts, and full-text 
      manuscripts for eligibility, and will systematically extract the data and will 
      assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Random-effects models will also be 
      used. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results of the systematic review will be 
      disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal regardless of outcome and 
      will be presented at relevant conferences. The data we will use do not include 
      individual patient data, so ethical approval is not required PROSPERO REGISTRATION

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between mortality and heart rate remains unclear for 
      patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in either sinus rhythm or 
      atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVES: This analysis explored the prognostic 
      importance of heart rate in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection 
      fraction in randomized controlled trials comparing beta-blockers and placebo. 
      METHODS: The Beta-Blockers in Heart Failure Collaborative Group performed a 
      meta-analysis of harmonized individual patient data from 11 double-blind randomized 
      controlled trials. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, analyzed with Cox 
      proportional hazard ratios (HR) modeling heart rate measured at baseline and 
      approximately 6 months post-randomization. RESULTS: A higher heart rate at baseline 
      was associated with greater all-cause mortality for patients in sinus rhythm 
      (n = 14,166; adjusted HR: 1.11 per 10 beats/min; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 
      to 1.15; p < 0.0001) but not in AF (n = 3,034; HR: 1.03 per 10 beats/min; 95% CI: 
      0.97 to 1.08; p = 0.38). Beta-blockers reduced ventricular rate by 12 beats/min in 
      both sinus rhythm and AF. Mortality was lower for patients in sinus rhythm 
      randomized to beta-blockers (HR: 0.73 vs. placebo; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.79; p < 0.001), 
      regardless of baseline heart rate (interaction p = 0.35). Beta-blockers had no 
      effect on mortality in patients with AF (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.12; p = 0.58) 
      at any heart rate (interaction p = 0.48). A lower achieved resting heart rate, 
      irrespective of treatment, was associated with better prognosis only for patients in 
      sinus rhythm (HR: 1.16 per 10 beats/min increase, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.22; p < 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of pre-treatment heart rate, beta-blockers reduce mortality 
      in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in sinus rhythm. 
      Achieving a lower heart rate is associated with better prognosis, but only for those 
      in sinus rhythm.

TI  - High-Dose Chemotherapy With Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for 
      High-Risk Primary Breast Cancer.
PG  - 70-5
LID - 10.1093/jncimonographs/lgv010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for breast cancer (BC) has been an area of 
      intense controversy among the medical oncology community. Over the last decade, due 
      to the presentation of negative results from early randomized studies, this approach 
      has not longer been considered an option by the vast majority of medical 
      oncologists. This article is aimed to clarify what happened and where we are now in 
      this not exhausted field. METHODS: We critically revised the published literature 
      regarding HDC in the setting of high-risk BC, including a recent meta-analysis using 
      individual patient data from 15 randomized studies. RESULTS: A significant benefit 
      by HDC in recurrence-free survival has been clearly documented in unselected patient 
      populations. In HER2-negative population, particularly in the triple-negative 
      disease, a positive effect of intensified therapy in overall survival is 
      biologically plausible and supported by clinical evidence. Over the years HDC with 
      support of adequate number of stem cells has become a safe treatment modality. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The administration of higher doses of chemotherapy with stem cell 
      support may still represent a therapeutic option (and not a recommendation) in 
      selected BC patients. This approach should be investigated further.

TI  - Paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty vs. drug-eluting stenting for the treatment of 
      coronary in-stent restenosis: a comprehensive, collaborative, individual patient 
      data meta-analysis of 10 randomized clinical trials (DAEDALUS study).
LID - ehz594 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehz594 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Consensus is lacking regarding the best treatment for coronary in-stent 
      restenosis (ISR). The two most effective treatments are angioplasty with 
      paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) and repeat stenting with drug-eluting stent (DES) 
      but individual trials were not statistically powered for clinical endpoints, results 
      were heterogeneous, and evidence about comparative efficacy and safety in relevant 
      subsets was limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Difference in Anti-restenotic 
      Effectiveness of Drug-eluting stent and drug-coated balloon AngiopLasty for the 
      occUrrence of coronary in-Stent restenosis (DAEDALUS) study was a comprehensive, 
      investigator-initiated, collaborative, individual patient data meta-analysis 
      comparing angioplasty with PCB alone vs. repeat stenting with DES alone for the 
      treatment of coronary ISR. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO 
      (CRD42017075007). All 10 available randomized clinical trials were included with 
      1976 patients enrolled, 1033 assigned to PCB and 943 to DES. At 3-year follow-up, 
      PCB was associated with a significant increase in the risk of target lesion 
      revascularization (TLR) compared with DES [hazard ratio (HR) 1.32, 95% CI 1.02-1.70, 
      P = 0.035; number-needed-to-harm 28.5]. There was a significant interaction between 
      treatment effect and type of restenosed stent (P = 0.029) with a more marked 
      difference in patients with DES-ISR and comparable effects in patients with 
      bare-metal stent-ISR. At 3-year follow-up, the primary safety endpoint of all-cause 
      death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion thrombosis was comparable between 
      treatments (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.58-1.09, P = 0.152). A pre-specified subgroup analysis 
      indicated a significant interaction between treatment effect and type of DES used to 
      treat ISR (P = 0.033), with a lower incidence of events associated with PCB compared 
      with first-generation DES and similar effect between PCB and second-generation DES 
      (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.71-1.60, P = 0.764). Long-term all-cause mortality was similar 
      between PCB and DES (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53-1.22, P = 0.310); results were consistent 
      comparing PCB and non-paclitaxel-based DES (HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.80-2.54, P = 0.235). 
      Myocardial infarction and target lesion thrombosis were comparable between 
      treatments. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coronary ISR, repeat stenting with DES is 
      moderately more effective than angioplasty with PCB at reducing the need for TLR at 
      3 years. The incidence of a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or 
      target lesion thrombosis was similar between groups. The rates of individual 
      endpoints, including all-cause mortality, were not significantly different between 
      groups.

TI  - Stereotactic radiosurgery for central nervous system hemangioblastoma: systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 11-22
LID - 10.1007/s11060-017-2697-0 [doi]
AB  - Hemangioblastomas are rare, benign, vascular tumors of the central nervous system 
      (CNS), often associated with von-hippel lindau (VHL) disease. Current therapeutic 
      options include microsurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). With no 
      randomized controlled studies and minimal data beyond single-institution reviews, 
      the optimal management approach for patients with CNS hemangioblastomas is unclear. 
      We completed a Pubmed/SCOPUS literature search from January 1990 to January 2017 for 
      eligible studies on SRS for CNS hemangioblastomas. Relevant articles were identified 
      and reviewed in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review 
      and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. 26 studies met eligibility criteria for 
      qualitative synthesis, representing 596 subjects and 1535 tumors. The Gamma Knife 
      was the most published SRS method for CNS hemangioblastomas. After critical study 
      appraisal for intra-study bias, 14 studies were used for quantitative meta-analysis 
      of 5-year progression free survival (PFS). The pooled 5-year PFS across all eligible 
      studies was 88.4%. No difference was observed between spine versus intracranial 
      studies. Individual patient data (IPD) was extracted from 14 studies, representing 
      322 tumors. Univariate analysis of IPD revealed that VHL patients were younger, and 
      had smaller tumors compared to those with sporadic disease. Adverse events were 
      associated with increasing marginal dose, independent of tumor volume. VHL status, 
      sex, radiosurgical method, tumor location, and tumor volume were not found to be 
      significantly associated with tumor progression. Multiple studies show excellent 
      tumor control at 5-year follow up, however, the long-term efficacy of SRS for CNS 
      hemangioblastomas still needs to be investigated, and the studies exploring the role 
      of SRS for early treatment of asymptomatic lesions is wanting.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Recommendation for Reporting of Surrogate Endpoint 
      Evaluation Using Meta-analyses.
PG  - pkz002
LID - 10.1093/jncics/pkz002 [doi]
LID - pkz002
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has been widely 
      conducted for the evaluation of surrogate endpoints in oncology, but little 
      attention has been given to the adequacy of reporting and interpretation. This 
      review evaluated the reporting quality of published meta-analyses on surrogacy 
      evaluation and developed recommendations for future reporting. METHODS: We searched 
      PubMed through August 2017 to identify studies that evaluated surrogate endpoints 
      using the meta-analyses of RCTs in oncology. Both individual patient data (IPD) and 
      aggregate data (AD) meta-analyses were included for the review. RESULTS: Eighty 
      meta-analyses were identified: 22 used IPD and 58 used AD from multiple RCTs. We 
      observed variability and reporting deficiencies in both IPD and AD meta-analyses, 
      especially on reporting of trial selection, endpoint definition, study and patient 
      characteristics for included RCTs, and important statistical methods and results. 
      Based on these findings, we proposed a checklist and recommendations to improve 
      completeness, consistency, and transparency of reports of meta-analytic surrogacy 
      evaluation. We highlighted key aspects of the design and analysis of surrogate 
      endpoints and presented explanations and rationale why these items should be clearly 
      reported in surrogacy evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Our reporting of surrogate endpoint 
      evaluation using meta-analyses (ReSEEM) guidelines and recommendations will improve 
      the quality in reporting and facilitate the interpretation and reproducibility of 
      meta-analytic surrogacy evaluation. Also, they should help promote greater 
      methodological consistency and could also serve as an evaluation tool in the peer 
      review process for assessing surrogacy research.

TI  - Individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of dual 
      therapy with a boosted PI plus lamivudine for maintenance of virological 
      suppression: GeSIDA study 9717.
PG  - 2927-2935
LID - 10.1093/jac/dky299 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dual therapy (DT) with a ritonavir-boosted PI (PI/r) plus lamivudine has 
      proven non-inferior (12% margin) to triple therapy (TT) with PI/r plus two 
      nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [N(t)RTIs] in four clinical trials. 
      It remains unclear whether DT is non-inferior based on the US FDA endpoint 
      (virological failure with a margin of 4%) or in specific subgroups. METHODS: We 
      performed a systematic search (January 1990 to March 2017) of randomized controlled 
      trials that compared switching of maintenance ART from TT to DT. The principal 
      investigators were contacted and agreed to share study databases. The primary 
      endpoint was non-inferiority of DT to TT based on the current FDA endpoint (4% 
      non-inferiority margin for virological failure at week 48). We also analysed whether 
      efficacy was modified by gender, active HCV infection and type of PI. Effect 
      estimates and 95% CIs were calculated using generalized estimating equation-based 
      models. RESULTS: We found 881 references that yielded eight articles corresponding 
      to four clinical trials (1051 patients). At week 48, 4% of patients on DT versus 
      3.04% on TT had experienced virological failure (difference 0.9%; 95% CI -1.2% to 
      3.1%), and 84.7% of patients on DT versus 83.2% on TT had <50 copies of HIV RNA/mL 
      (FDA snapshot algorithm) (difference 1.4%; 95% CI -2.8% to 5.8%). Gender, active HCV 
      infection and type of PI had no effect on differences in treatment efficacy between 
      DT and TT. CONCLUSIONS: DT was non-inferior to TT using both current and past FDA 
      endpoints. The efficacy of DT was not influenced by gender, active HCV infection 
      status, or type of PI.

TI  - Is the fatigue an adverse event of the second generation of hormonal therapy? Data 
      from a literature-based meta-analysis.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1007/s12032-018-1081-z [doi]
AB  - New hormonal therapies have enriched the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with 
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Fatigue is one of the most common 
      adverse events registered in phase III trials of these new drugs. The aim of this 
      article is to perform a meta-analysis based on all available literature data focused 
      on the risk rate (RR) of fatigue from new hormonal agent-based therapy in patients 
      with CRPC. A total of 11,751 cases were included from 11 randomized trials. The 
      analysis revealed that the second generation of hormonal therapies increased the RR 
      of any-grade fatigue (RR = 1.27) and grade 3-4 fatigue (RR = 1.25). This last 
      adverse event was always higher in a pre-chemotherapy setting. In conclusion, given 
      the limitations of a literature-based study, rather than a meta-analysis based on 
      individual patients' data, our study confirmed the increase in the RR for any-grade 
      and grade 3-4 fatigue during the second generation of hormonal therapies, with 
      particular attention being paid to grade 3-4 in the pre-chemotherapy setting of the 
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute hypoxaemia de novo or on a background of chronic hypoxaemia is a 
      common reason for admission to intensive care and for provision of mechanical 
      ventilation. Various refinements of mechanical ventilation or adjuncts are employed 
      to improve patient outcomes. Mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome, one 
      of the main contributors to the need for mechanical ventilation for hypoxaemia, 
      remains approximately 40%. Ventilation in the prone position may improve lung 
      mechanics and gas exchange and could improve outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of 
      this review are (1) to ascertain whether prone ventilation offers a mortality 
      advantage when compared with traditional supine or semi recumbent ventilation in 
      patients with severe acute respiratory failure requiring conventional invasive 
      artificial ventilation, and (2) to supplement previous systematic reviews on prone 
      ventilation for hypoxaemic respiratory failure in an adult population. SEARCH 
      METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 
      2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 31 January 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 31 January 
      2014), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 
      to 31 January 2014) and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) 
      (1992 to 31 January 2014) in Ovid MEDLINE for eligible randomized controlled trials. 
      We also searched for studies by handsearching reference lists of relevant articles, 
      by contacting colleagues and by handsearching published proceedings of relevant 
      journals. We applied no language constraints, and we reran the searches in CENTRAL, 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACS in June 2015. We added five new studies of 
      potential interest to the list of "Studies awaiting classification" and will 
      incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update. SELECTION 
      CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effects 
      of prone position versus supine/semi recumbent position during conventional 
      mechanical ventilation in adult participants with acute hypoxaemia. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently reviewed all trials identified by the 
      search and assessed them for suitability, methods and quality. Two review authors 
      extracted data, and three review authors reviewed the data extracted. We analysed 
      data using Review Manager software and pooled included studies to determine the risk 
      ratio (RR) for mortality and the risk ratio or mean difference (MD) for secondary 
      outcomes; we also performed subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. MAIN 
      RESULTS: We identified nine relevant RCTs, which enrolled a total of 2165 
      participants (10 publications). All recruited participants suffered from disorders 
      of lung function causing moderate to severe hypoxaemia and requiring mechanical 
      ventilation, so they were fairly comparable, given the heterogeneity of specific 
      disease diagnoses in intensive care. Risk of bias, although acceptable in the view 
      of the review authors, was inevitable: Blinding of participants and carers to 
      treatment allocation was not possible (face-up vs face-down).Primary analyses of 
      short- and longer-term mortality pooled from six trials demonstrated an RR of 0.84 
      to 0.86 in favour of the prone position (PP), but findings were not statistically 
      significant: In the short term, mortality for those ventilated prone was 33.4% 
      (363/1086) and supine 38.3% (395/1031). This resulted in an RR of 0.84 (95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.02) marginally in favour of PP. For longer-term 
      mortality, results showed 41.7% (462/1107) for prone and 47.1% (490/1041) for supine 
      positions, with an RR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.03). The quality of the evidence for 
      both outcomes was rated as low as a result of important potential bias and serious 
      inconsistency.Subgroup analyses for mortality identified three groups consistently 
      favouring PP: those recruited within 48 hours of meeting entry criteria (five 
      trials; 1024 participants showed an RR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 94)); those treated 
      in the PP for 16 or more hours per day (five trials; 1005 participants showed an RR 
      of 0.77 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.99)); and participants with more severe hypoxaemia at 
      trial entry (six trials; 1108 participants showed an RR of 0.77 (95% CI 0.65 to 
      0.92)). The quality of the evidence for these outcomes was rated as moderate as a 
      result of potentially important bias.Prone positioning appeared to influence adverse 
      effects: Pressure sores (three trials; 366 participants) with an RR of 1.37 (95% CI 
      1.05 to 1.79) and tracheal tube obstruction with an RR of 1.78 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.60) 
      were increased with prone ventilation. Reporting of arrhythmias was reduced with PP, 
      with an RR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.87). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no 
      convincing evidence of benefit nor harm from universal application of PP in adults 
      with hypoxaemia mechanically ventilated in intensive care units (ICUs). Three 
      subgroups (early implementation of PP, prolonged adoption of PP and severe 
      hypoxaemia at study entry) suggested that prone positioning may confer a 
      statistically significant mortality advantage. Additional adequately powered studies 
      would be required to confirm or refute these possibilities of subgroup benefit but 
      are unlikely, given results of the most recent study and recommendations derived 
      from several published subgroup analyses. Meta-analysis of individual patient data 
      could be useful for further data exploration in this regard. Complications such as 
      tracheal obstruction are increased with use of prone ventilation. Long-term 
      mortality data (12 months and beyond), as well as functional, neuro-psychological 
      and quality of life data, are required if future studies are to better inform the 
      role of PP in the management of hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the 
      efficacy of vasopressin-epinephrine compared to epinephrine alone in patients who 
      suffered out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). METHODS: Relevant studies up to 
      February 2017 were identified by searching in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, 
      Wanfang for randomized controlled trials(RCTs) assigning adults with cardiac arrest 
      to treatment with vasopressin-epinephrine (VEgroup) vs adrenaline (epinephrine) 
      alone (E group). The outcome point was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for 
      patients suffering from OHCA. Heterogeneity, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis 
      and publication bias were explored. RESULTS: Individual patient data were obtained 
      from 5047 participants who experienced OHCA in nine studies. Odds ratios (ORs) were 
      calculated using a random-effects model and results suggested that 
      vasopressin-epinephrine was associated with higher rate of ROSC (OR=1.67, 95% 
      CI=1.13-2.49, P<0.00001, and total I(2)=83%). Subgroup showed that 
      vasopressin-epinephrine has a significant association with improvements in ROSC for 
      patients from Asia (OR=3.30, 95% CI=1.30-7.88); but for patients from other regions, 
      there was no difference between vasopressin-epinephrine and epinephrine alone 
      (OR=1.07, 95% CI=0.72-1.61). CONCLUSION: According to the pooled results of the 
      subgroup, combination of vasopressin and adrenaline can improve ROSC of OHCA from 
      Asia, but patients from other regions who suffered from OHCA cannot benefit from 
      combination of vasopressin and epinephrine.

TI  - Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and 
      cardiovascular disease.
PG  - CD010315
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010315.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD010315
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and 
      mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at 
      particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure below standard targets may be 
      beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but 
      could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with 
      hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with 
      reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure 
      targets (≤ 140 to 160/ 90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension 
      and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, 
      peripheral vascular occlusive disease). SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Hypertension 
      Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled 
      trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), 
      Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials 
      Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the Latin American and 
      Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (from 1982) and contacted authors of 
      relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. There were no 
      language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group and at least six months follow-up. 
      Trial reports needed to present data for at least one primary outcome (total 
      mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular 
      mortality). Eligible interventions were lower target for systolic/diastolic blood 
      pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard target for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 
      160/90 to 100 mmHg).Participants were adults with documented hypertension or who 
      were receiving treatment for hypertension and cardiovascular history for myocardial 
      infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease or angina 
      pectoris. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed 
      search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected 
      by The Cochrane Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: We included six RCTs that involved a 
      total of 9795 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). 
      Five RCTs provided individual patient data for 6775 participants.We found no change 
      in total mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 
      0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, no differences 
      were found in serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low-quality 
      evidence). There was a reduction in fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events 
      (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization or death 
      from congestive heart failure) with the lower target (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98; 
      ARR 1.6% over 3.7 years; low-quality evidence). There were more participant 
      withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 
      32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower' target 
      group by 9.5/4.9 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group but blood 
      pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group. 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of a difference in total mortality and serious 
      adverse events was found between treating to a lower or to a standard blood pressure 
      target in people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This suggests no net 
      health benefit from a lower systolic blood pressure target despite the small 
      absolute reduction in total cardiovascular serious adverse events. There was very 
      limited evidence on adverse events, which lead to high uncertainty. At present there 
      is insufficient evidence to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in 
      people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are 
      needed to answer this question.

TI  - Individual-patient meta-analysis of three randomized trials comparing endovascular 
      versus open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
PG  - 1229-39
LID - 10.1002/bjs.9852 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefits of endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic 
      aneurysm remain controversial, without any strong evidence about advantages in 
      specific subgroups. METHODS: An individual-patient data meta-analysis of three 
      recent randomized trials of endovascular versus open repair of abdominal aortic 
      aneurysm was conducted according to a prespecified analysis plan, reporting on 
      results to 90 days after the index event. RESULTS: The trials included a total of 
      836 patients. The mortality rate across the three trials was 31.3 per cent for 
      patients randomized to endovascular repair/strategy and 34.0 per cent for those 
      randomized to open repair at 30 days (pooled odds ratio 0.88, 95 per cent c.i. 0.66 
      to 1.18), and 34.3 and 38.0 per cent respectively at 90 days (pooled odds ratio 
      0.85, 0.64 to 1.13). There was no evidence of significant heterogeneity in the odds 
      ratios between trials. Mean(s.d.) aneurysm diameter was 8.2(1.9) cm and the overall 
      in-hospital mortality rate was 34.8 per cent. There was no significant effect 
      modification with age or Hardman index, but there was indication of an early benefit 
      from an endovascular strategy for women. Discharge from the primary hospital was 
      faster after endovascular repair (hazard ratio 1.24, 95 per cent c.i. 1.04 to 1.47). 
      For open repair, 30-day mortality diminished with increasing aneurysm neck length 
      (adjusted odds ratio 0.69 (95 per cent c.i. 0.53 to 0.89) per 15 mm), but aortic 
      diameter was not associated with mortality for either type of repair. CONCLUSION: 
      Survival to 90 days following an endovascular or open repair strategy is similar for 
      all patients and for the restricted population anatomically suitable for 
      endovascular repair. Women may benefit more from an endovascular strategy than men 
      and patients are, on average, discharged sooner after endovascular repair.

TI  - Time-Varying Outcomes With the Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold During 5-Year 
      Follow-up: A Systematic Meta-analysis and Individual Patient Data Pooled Study.
PG  - 1261-1269
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2019.4101 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Bioresorbable scaffolds were designed to provide clinical benefits after 
      their complete bioresorption. Prior studies demonstrated early risks with the Absorb 
      polymeric bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS). Whether this risk profile changes 
      over time during the course of its bioresorption is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine 
      outcomes of the first-generation BVS before and after 3 years, the point of its 
      complete bioresorption in animals. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE and the 
      Cochrane database, conference proceedings, and public websites for relevant studies. 
      STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials of BVS vs metallic 
      drug-eluting stents in patients with coronary artery disease with at least 5-year 
      follow-up. Four trials of BVS vs everolimus-eluting stents (EES) with 3384 patients 
      met criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Individual patient data from the 4 
      trials were pooled, and summary-level meta-analysis was performed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The major effectiveness and safety measures were target lesion failure 
      (TLF; cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven 
      target lesion revascularization) and device thrombosis. Outcomes were examined 
      through 5-year follow-up and between 0 to 3 and 3 to 5 years. RESULTS: Mean age for 
      the 3384 patients was 62.8 years; 2452 patients were men (72.5%), and diabetes was 
      present in 1020 patients (30.2%). Through 5-year follow-up, treatment with BVS 
      compared with EES was associated with higher rates of TLF (14.9% vs 11.6%; HR, 1.26; 
      95% CI, 1.03-1.54; P = .03) and device thrombosis (2.5% vs 0.8%; HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 
      1.46-5.65; P = .002). Target lesion failure occurred in 11.6% of BVS-treated 
      patients vs 7.9% of EES-treated patients between 0 to 3 years (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 
      1.12-1.80), and 4.3% of BVS-treated patients vs 4.5% of EES-treated patients between 
      3 to 5 years (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.64-1.31) (P for interaction = .046). Device 
      thrombosis occurred in 2.4% of BVS-treated patients vs 0.6% of EES-treated patients 
      between 0 to 3 years (HR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.75-8.50) and 0.1% of BVS-treated patients 
      vs 0.3% of EES-treated patients between 3 to 5 years (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.07-2.70) 
      (P for interaction = .03). These results were consistent by spline analysis and 
      after multiple imputation and multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The 
      period of excess risk for the first-generation Absorb BVS ends at 3 years. These 
      data provide mechanistic insights into the timing of adverse events after BVS and 
      identify the hurdles to be overcome for bioresorbable technology to be accepted as a 
      valid alternative for patients with coronary artery disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

PG  - 1915-1922
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000004606 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether genetic subgroups in recent amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) trials responded to treatment with lithium carbonate, but that the 
      treatment effect was lost in a large cohort of nonresponders. METHODS: Individual 
      participant data were obtained from 3 randomized trials investigating the efficacy 
      of lithium carbonate. We matched clinical data with data regarding the UNC13A and 
      C9orf72 genotype. Our primary outcome was survival at 12 months. On an exploratory 
      basis, we assessed whether the effect of lithium depended on the genotype. RESULTS: 
      Clinical data were available for 518 of the 606 participants. Overall, treatment 
      with lithium carbonate did not improve 12-month survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.0, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 0.7-1.4; p = 0.96). Both the UNC13A and C9orf72 genotype 
      were independent predictors of survival (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.3; p = 0.006 and HR 
      2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.2; p = 0.032, respectively). The effect of lithium was different 
      for UNC13A carriers (p = 0.027), but not for C9orf72 carriers (p = 0.22). The 
      12-month survival probability for UNC13A carriers treated with lithium carbonate 
      improved from 40.1% (95% CI 23.2-69.1) to 69.7% (95% CI 50.4-96.3). CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study incorporated genetic data into past ALS trials to determine treatment 
      effects in a genetic post hoc analysis. Our results suggest that we should reorient 
      our strategies toward finding treatments for ALS, start focusing on 
      genotype-targeted treatments, and standardize genotyping in order to optimize 
      randomization and analysis for future clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether disagreements among 
      multiple data sources affect systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials 
      (RCTs). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Eligible RCTs examined gabapentin for neuropathic 
      pain and quetiapine for bipolar depression, reported in public (e.g., journal 
      articles) and nonpublic sources (clinical study reports [CSRs] and individual 
      participant data [IPD]). RESULTS: We found 21 gabapentin RCTs (74 reports, 6 IPD) 
      and 7 quetiapine RCTs (50 reports, 1 IPD); most were reported in journal articles 
      (18/21 [86%] and 6/7 [86%], respectively). When available, CSRs contained the most 
      trial design and risk of bias information. CSRs and IPD contained the most results. 
      For the outcome domains "pain intensity" (gabapentin) and "depression" (quetiapine), 
      we found single trials with 68 and 98 different meta-analyzable results, 
      respectively; by purposefully selecting one meta-analyzable result for each RCT, we 
      could change the overall result for pain intensity from effective (standardized mean 
      difference [SMD] = -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.63 to -0.27) to 
      ineffective (SMD = -0.06; 95% CI: -0.24 to 0.12). We could change the effect for 
      depression from a medium effect (SMD = -0.55; 95% CI: -0.85 to -0.25) to a small 
      effect (SMD = -0.26; 95% CI: -0.41 to -0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Disagreements across data 
      sources affect the effect size, statistical significance, and interpretation of 
      trials and meta-analyses.

LID - 10.1002/ejp.649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ibuprofen and paracetamol have long been used as analgesics in a range 
      of acute, intermittent and chronic pain conditions. Paracetamol is often the first 
      line analgesic recommended, without consensus about which is the better analgesic. 
      METHODS: An overview review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses directly 
      compares ibuprofen and paracetamol at standard doses in particular painful 
      conditions, or uses indirect comparisons against placebo. Electronic searches for 
      systematic reviews were sought published since 1995 using outcomes approximating to 
      ≥50% pain intensity reduction. Painful conditions were acute post-operative pain, 
      dysmenorrhoea, tension-type headache (TTH), migraine, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
      arthritis, back pain, cancer and paediatric pain. There was no systematic assessment 
      of harm. RESULTS: Sixteen systematic reviews and four individual patient data 
      meta-analyses were included. Ibuprofen was consistently superior to paracetamol at 
      conventional doses in a range of painful conditions. Two direct comparisons favoured 
      ibuprofen (acute pain, osteoarthritis). Three of four indirect comparisons favoured 
      ibuprofen (acute pain, migraine, osteoarthritis); one showed no difference (TTH), 
      although there were methodological problems. In five pain conditions (dysmenorrhoea, 
      paediatric pain, cancer pain, back pain and rheumatoid arthritis), there were 
      limited data on paracetamol and ibuprofen. CONCLUSIONS: At standard doses in 
      different painful conditions, ibuprofen was usually superior producing more patients 
      with the degree of pain relief that patients feel worthwhile. Neither of the drugs 
      will be effective for everyone, and both are needed. This overview questions the 
      practice of routinely using paracetamol as a first line analgesic because there is 
      no good evidence for efficacy of paracetamol in many pain conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients frequently develop brain 
      metastases (BM), even though the initial imaging with brain CT or MRI was negative. 
      Stage III patients have the highest risk to develop BM, with an incidence of 
      approximately 30%. BM can lead to neurocognitive disorders, loss of quality of life 
      (QoL), and they are the most important factors influencing patient's overall 
      survival (OS). Although a radical local treatment of BM may be possible with primary 
      radiosurgery or after resection, the prognosis often remains poor. Preventing the 
      development of BM through prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) may improve the 
      outcome of these patients. METHODS: Data from published randomized trials comparing 
      PCI with non-PCI were sought using electronic database (PubMed) searching, hand 
      searching, and by contacting experts. Trials were included if they considered a 
      randomized comparison of PCI and non-PCI, enrolled NSCLC patients, excluded patients 
      with recurrent or metastatic disease, and reported results on BM occurrence. Each 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) was assessed for methodological quality using the 
      Cochrane collaboration's tool for the assessment of risk of bias. Study estimates 
      were pooled using a fixed effects sample-weighted meta-analysis approach to 
      calculate an overall estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results on 
      PCI-related toxicity, QoL, and OS were only reported descriptively. RESULTS: Seven 
      RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. In total, 1,462 patients were analyzed, 
      including 717 patients who received PCI and 745 patients who did not. The risk of 
      developing BM was significantly decreased through PCI (13% reduction, RR 0.33; 95% 
      CI 0.22-0.45). PCI-related toxicity and QoL data were limited. Acute toxicity mostly 
      included fatigue, skin-related toxicity, and nausea or vomiting. Late toxicities 
      such as headache, dyspnea, lethargy, and low grade cognitive impairments were also 
      reported in some of the included RCTs. Results on OS were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: 
      The risk of developing BM was reduced in patients who received PCI compared to 
      patients who did not. To implement PCI as the standard treatment for patients with 
      NSCLC, the impact of PCI-related toxicity on QoL should be further investigated, as 
      well as long-term OS. A future individual patient data meta-analysis could produce 
      definitive answers to this clinical question.

TI  - High-flow nasal cannulae for respiratory support in adult intensive care patients.
PG  - CD010172
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010172.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD010172
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) deliver high flows of blended humidified 
      air and oxygen via wide-bore nasal cannulae and may be useful in providing 
      respiratory support for adult patients experiencing acute respiratory failure in the 
      intensive care unit (ICU). OBJECTIVES: We evaluated studies that included 
      participants 16 years of age and older who were admitted to the ICU and required 
      treatment with HFNC. We assessed the safety and efficacy of HFNC compared with 
      comparator interventions in terms of treatment failure, mortality, adverse events, 
      duration of respiratory support, hospital and ICU length of stay, respiratory 
      effects, patient-reported outcomes, and costs of treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We 
      searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 
      3), MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), 
      Embase, Web of Science, proceedings from four conferences, and clinical trials 
      registries; and we handsearched reference lists of relevant studies. We conducted 
      searches from January 2000 to March 2016 and reran the searches in December 2016. We 
      added four new studies of potential interest to a list of 'Studies awaiting 
      classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the 
      review update. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled studies with a 
      parallel or cross-over design comparing HFNC use in adult ICU patients versus other 
      forms of non-invasive respiratory support (low-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae or 
      mask, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and bilevel positive airway 
      pressure (BiPAP)). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently 
      assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. MAIN 
      RESULTS: We included 11 studies with 1972 participants. Participants in six studies 
      had respiratory failure, and in five studies required oxygen therapy after 
      extubation. Ten studies compared HFNC versus low-flow oxygen devices; one of these 
      also compared HFNC versus CPAP, and another compared HFNC versus BiPAP alone. Most 
      studies reported randomization and allocation concealment inadequately and provided 
      inconsistent details of outcome assessor blinding. We did not combine data for CPAP 
      and BiPAP comparisons with data for low-flow oxygen devices; study data were 
      insufficient for separate analysis of CPAP and BiPAP for most outcomes. For the 
      primary outcomes of treatment failure (1066 participants; six studies) and mortality 
      (755 participants; three studies), investigators found no differences between HFNC 
      and low-flow oxygen therapies (risk ratio (RR), Mantel-Haenszel (MH), random-effects 
      0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.27; and RR, MH, random-effects 0.63, 
      95% CI 0.38 to 1.06, respectively). We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the 
      certainty of this evidence to low because of study risks of bias and different 
      participant indications. Reported adverse events included nosocomial pneumonia, 
      oxygen desaturation, visits to general practitioner for respiratory complications, 
      pneumothorax, acute pseudo-obstruction, cardiac dysrhythmia, septic shock, and 
      cardiorespiratory arrest. However, single studies reported adverse events, and we 
      could not combine these findings; one study reported fewer episodes of oxygen 
      desaturation with HFNC but no differences in all other reported adverse events. We 
      downgraded the certainty of evidence for adverse events to low because of limited 
      data. Researchers noted no differences in ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD), 
      inverse variance (IV), random-effects 0.15, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.34; four studies; 770 
      participants), and we downgraded quality to low because of study risks of bias and 
      different participant indications. We found no differences in oxygenation variables: 
      partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2))/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) 
      (MD, IV, random-effects 7.31, 95% CI -23.69 to 41.31; four studies; 510 
      participants); PaO(2) (MD, IV, random-effects 2.79, 95% CI -5.47 to 11.05; three 
      studies; 355 participants); and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) up to 24 hours (MD, IV, 
      random-effects 0.72, 95% CI -0.73 to 2.17; four studies; 512 participants). Data 
      from two studies showed that oxygen saturation measured after 24 hours was improved 
      among those treated with HFNC (MD, IV, random-effects 1.28, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.55; 445 
      participants), but this difference was small and was not clinically significant. 
      Along with concern about risks of bias and differences in participant indications, 
      review authors noted a high level of unexplained statistical heterogeneity in 
      oxygenation effect estimates, and we downgraded the quality of evidence to very low. 
      Meta-analysis of three comparable studies showed no differences in carbon dioxide 
      clearance among those treated with HFNC (MD, IV, random-effects -0.75, 95% CI -2.04 
      to 0.55; three studies; 590 participants). Two studies reported no differences in 
      atelectasis; we did not combine these findings. Data from six studies (867 
      participants) comparing HFNC versus low-flow oxygen showed no differences in 
      respiratory rates up to 24 hours according to type of oxygen delivery device (MD, 
      IV, random-effects -1.51, 95% CI -3.36 to 0.35), and no difference after 24 hours 
      (MD, IV, random-effects -2.71, 95% CI -7.12 to 1.70; two studies; 445 participants). 
      Improvement in respiratory rates when HFNC was compared with CPAP or BiPAP was not 
      clinically important (MD, IV, random-effects -0.89, 95% CI -1.74 to -0.05; two 
      studies; 834 participants). Results showed no differences in patient-reported 
      measures of comfort according to oxygen delivery devices in the short term (MD, IV, 
      random-effects 0.14, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.93; three studies; 462 participants) and in 
      the long term (MD, IV, random-effects -0.36, 95% CI -3.70 to 2.98; two studies; 445 
      participants); we downgraded the certainty of this evidence to low. Six studies 
      measured dyspnoea on incomparable scales, yielding inconsistent study data. No study 
      in this review provided data on positive end-expiratory pressure measured at the 
      pharyngeal level, work of breathing, or cost comparisons of treatment. AUTHORS' 
      CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to demonstrate whether HFNC was a more effective or safe 
      oxygen delivery device compared with other oxygenation devices in adult ICU 
      patients. Meta-analysis could be performed for few studies for each outcome, and 
      data for comparisons with CPAP or BiPAP were very limited. In addition, we 
      identified some risks of bias among included studies, differences in patient groups, 
      and high levels of statistical heterogeneity for some outcomes, leading to 
      uncertainty regarding the results of our analysis. Consequently, evidence is 
      insufficient to show whether HFNC provides safe and efficacious respiratory support 
      for adult ICU patients.

      system. The recipient of this grant was the institution of The Prince Charles 
      Hospital, not JFF personally. The grant period was from April 2010 to March 2013. 
      This unrestricted grant assisted in partially funding employment of a research nurse 
      (Taressa Bull) to complete the study titled ‘Oxygen delivery through high‐flow nasal 
      cannulae increases end expiratory lung volume and reduces respiratory rate in 
      post‐cardiac surgical patients when compared to standard low flow oxygen’ (Corley 
      2011). This study is not eligible for inclusion in the current review. Fisher and 
      Paykel Healthcare Ltd had no part in study design, data collection, data analysis, 
      or manuscript preparation for that study (Corley 2011). Fisher and Paykel Healthcare 
      Ltd paid for AC to attend the American Thoracic Society meeting in New Orleans, in 
      May 2010 (airfare), and a Fisher and Paykel research meeting in Auckland, New

TI  - Cervical length screening for prevention of preterm birth in singleton pregnancy 
      with threatened preterm labor: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized 
      controlled trials using individual patient-level data.
PG  - 322-329
LID - 10.1002/uog.17388 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cervical length screening by transvaginal sonography (TVS) has been shown 
      to be a good predictive test for spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) in symptomatic 
      singleton pregnancy with threatened preterm labor (PTL). The aim of this review and 
      meta-analysis of individual participant data was to evaluate the effect of knowledge 
      of the TVS cervical length (CL) in preventing PTB in singleton pregnancies 
      presenting with threatened PTL. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and 
      Childbirth Group's Trials Register and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's 
      Trials Register (May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection 
      criteria included randomized controlled trials of singleton gestations with 
      threatened PTL randomized to management based mainly on CL screening (intervention 
      group), or CL screening with no knowledge of results or no CL screening (control 
      group). Participants included women with singleton gestations at 23 + 0 to 36 + 6 
      weeks with threatened PTL. We contacted corresponding authors of included trials to 
      request access to the data and perform a meta-analysis of individual participant 
      data. Data provided by the investigators were merged into a master database 
      constructed specifically for the review. The primary outcome was PTB < 37 weeks. 
      Summary measures were reported as relative risk (RR) or as mean difference (MD) with 
      95% CI. RESULTS: Three trials including a total of 287 singleton gestations with 
      threatened PTL between 24 + 0 and 35 + 6 weeks were included in the meta-analysis, 
      of which 145 were randomized to CL screening with knowledge of results and 142 to no 
      knowledge of CL. Compared with the control group, women who were randomized to the 
      known CL group had a significantly lower rate of PTB < 37 weeks (22.1% vs 34.5%; RR, 
      0.64 (95% CI, 0.44-0.94); three trials; 287 participants) and a later gestational 
      age at delivery (MD, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.03-1.25) weeks; MD, 4.48 (95% CI, 1.18-8.98) 
      days; three trials; 287 participants). All other outcomes for which there were 
      available data were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant 
      association between knowledge of TVS CL and lower incidence of PTB and later 
      gestational age at delivery in symptomatic singleton gestations with threatened PTL. 
      Given that in the meta-analysis we found a significant 36% reduction in the primary 
      outcome, but other outcomes were mostly statistically similar, further study needs 
      to be undertaken to understand better whether the predictive characteristics of CL 
      screening by TVS can be translated into better clinical management and therefore 
      better outcomes and under what circumstances. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG. Published by

      PARTO PRETÉRMINO EN EMBARAZOS CON FETO ÚNICO Y RIESGO DE PARTO PREMATURO: REVISIÓN 
      SISTEMÁTICA Y METAANÁLISIS DE ENSAYOS CONTROLADOS ALEATORIZADOS HACIENDO USO DE LOS 
      DATOS INDIVIDUALES DE LAS PACIENTES: RESUMEN OBJETIVO: El cribado mediante la 
      longitud cervical obtenida con ecografía transvaginal (ETV) ha demostrado ser una 
      buena prueba para la predicción del parto pretérmino espontáneo (PPTE) en embarazos 
      con feto único sintomáticos debido a la amenaza de parto pretérmino (PPT). El 
      objetivo de esta revisión y metaanálisis de los datos de participantes individuales 
      fue evaluar el efecto de medir la longitud cervical (LC) mediante ETV con el fin de 
      prevenir el parto prematuro en embarazos únicos con amenaza de PPT. MÉTODOS: Se 
      realizaron búsquedas en los ficheros de ensayos de Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth 
      Group y Complementary Medicine Field (mayo de 2016), y en las listas de referencias 
      de los estudios encontrados. Los criterios de selección incluyeron ensayos 
      controlados aleatorizados de embarazos con feto único y riesgo de PPT con 
      aleatorización de la paciente basada principalmente en el cribado mediante la LC 
      (grupo de intervención), el cribado mediante la LC sin conocimiento de los 
      resultados, o sin cribado de LC (grupo de control). Las participantes fueron mujeres 
      embarazadas con feto único desde las 23 + 0 hasta las 36 + 6 semanas y con riesgo de 
      PPT. Se estableció contacto con los autores de los ensayos incluidos para solicitar 
      el acceso a los datos y llevar a cabo un metaanálisis de los datos de las 
      participantes individualmente. Los datos proporcionados por los investigadores se 
      agregaron a una base de datos maestra creada específicamente para esta revisión. El 
      resultado primario fue el PPTE < 37 semanas. Las medidas resumen se reportaron como 
      riesgo relativo (RR) o como diferencia de medias (DM) con IC del 95%. RESULTADOS: En 
      el metaanálisis se incluyeron tres ensayos con un total de 287 embarazos con feto 
      único y riesgo de PPT entre 24 + 0 y 35 + 6 semanas, de los cuales 145 fueron 
      asignados al azar a un cribado mediante la LC con conocimiento de los resultados y 
      142 a aquellos para los que se desconocía la LC. En comparación con el grupo 
      control, las mujeres que fueron asignadas aleatoriamente al grupo en el que se 
      conocía la LC tuvieron una tasa de parto prematuro a < 37 semanas significativamente 
      menor (22,1% vs. 34,5%; RR 0,64 (IC 95%, 0,44-0,94); 3 ensayos; 287 participantes ) 
      y una edad gestacional al momento del parto más tardía (DM 0,64 (IC 95%, 0.03-1.25) 
      semanas; DM 4,48 (IC 95%, 1,18-8,98) días; 3 ensayos; 287 participantes). El resto 
      de los resultados para los cuales había datos disponibles fueron similares en ambos 
      grupos. CONCLUSIONES: Existe una asociación significativa entre el conocimiento de 
      la LC obtenida mediante ETV y una menor incidencia de PPTE y edad gestacional más 
      tardía en el momento del parto en embarazos con feto único sintomáticos debido al 
      riesgo de parto pretérmino (PPT). Teniendo en cuenta que en el metaanálisis se 
      encontró una reducción significativa del 36% en el resultado primario, pero que los 
      otros resultados fueron estadísticamente similares en su mayoría, serán necesarios 
      más estudios para entender mejor si las propiedades predictivas del cribado mediante 
      la LC obtenida con ETV se pueden traducir en una mejor atención clínica y por lo 
      tanto mejores resultados dependiendo de las circunstancias. :META: : ,(preterm

TI  - Low dose versus standard dose of corticosteroids in the management of adverse events 
      of special interest from abiraterone acetate: data from a literature-based 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 166
LID - 10.1007/s12032-017-1028-9 [doi]
AB  - Abiraterone acetate is a CYP-17 inhibitor approved for the treatment of prostate 
      cancer. Abiraterone acetate (AA) therapy is associated with toxicities, including 
      hypokalemia, hypertension, liver function test abnormalities and cardiac events. 
      These adverse events are traditionally managed with a standard dose of 
      corticosteroids. However, preliminary data are available on the use of a lower dose 
      of corticosteroids. The aim of this report is to perform a pooled analysis 
      evaluating the risk ratio (RR) of AA-related adverse events of special interest 
      associated with low or standard dose of corticosteroids. A total of 5374 cases from 
      4 randomized clinical trials were included. Subgroup analysis according to 
      corticosteroids dosage revealed a higher RR of adverse events associated with a dose 
      of 5 mg, compared to 10 mg. In particular, there was a statistically significant 
      higher RR of hypokalemia and ALT/AST increase, and only a modest risk increase for 
      cardiac disorders and hypertension. In conclusion, given the limitations of a 
      literature-based study, in comparison with a meta-analysis based on individual 
      patients' data, our study identified a relatively small increase in RR for 
      hypertension and cardiac disorders and a bigger increase of RR for hypokalemia and 
      ALT/AST toxicity when 5 mg, rather than 10 mg of corticosteroids were administered 
      to manage adverse events of special interest from AA. Further studies with specified 
      end-points are awaited to confirm these results.

AB  - Treatment intensification to maximize disease control and reduced intensity 
      approaches to minimize the risk of late sequelae have been evaluated in newly 
      diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. The influence of these interventions on the risk of 
      secondary malignant neoplasms, progression-free survival and overall survival is 
      reported in the meta-analysis herein, based on individual patient data from 9498 
      patients treated within 16 randomized controlled trials for newly diagnosed Hodgkin 
      lymphoma between 1984 and 2007. Secondary malignant neoplasms were meta-analyzed 
      using Peto's method as time-to-event outcomes. For progression-free and overall 
      survival, hazard ratios derived from each trial using Cox regression were combined 
      by inverse-variance weighting. Five study questions (combined-modality treatment vs. 
      chemotherapy alone; more extended vs. involved-field radiotherapy; radiation at 
      higher doses vs. radiation at 20 Gy; more vs. fewer cycles of the same chemotherapy 
      protocol; standard-dose chemotherapy vs. intensified chemotherapy) were 
      investigated. After a median follow-up of 7.4 years, dose-intensified chemotherapy 
      resulted in better progression-free survival rates (P=0.007) as compared with 
      standard-dose chemotherapy, but was associated with an increased risk of 
      therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (P=0.0028). No 
      progression-free or overall survival differences were observed between 
      combined-modality treatment and chemotherapy alone, but more secondary malignant 
      neoplasms were seen after combined-modality treatment (P=0.010). For the remaining 
      three study questions, outcomes and secondary malignancy rates did not differ 
      significantly between treatment strategies. The results of this meta-analysis help 
      to weigh up efficacy and secondary malignancy risk for the choice of first-line 
      treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma patients. However, final conclusions regarding 
      secondary solid tumors require longer follow-up.

AB  - The roll by the cytotoxic chemotherapy and its efficacy in the treatment of 
      non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) was not clearly identified until the 1980s when 
      studies showed that cisplatin was beneficial in the treatment of NSCLC. The first 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of post-operative 
      (adjuvant) chemotherapy using the cisplatin regimen for resectable NSCLC was 
      reported in 1988. Since then, an increasing number of RCTs have been carried out to 
      evaluate post-operative chemotherapy. Pre-operative (neo-adjuvant) chemotherapy is a 
      relatively new treatment strategy, as its name indicates. Compared with 
      post-operative chemotherapy, fewer RCTs have been carried out to evaluate 
      pre-operative chemotherapy. Given the inconsistency of the results from the RCTs, at 
      least 12 meta-analyses have been published. Most of these meta-analyses reported 
      overall survival (OS) benefit with hazard ratios (HRs) in the range of 0.81 to 0.89 
      in favor of pre-operative chemotherapy. An individual patient data meta-analysis by 
      Burdett in 2014 indicates that the option of pre-operative chemotherapy + surgery is 
      associated with better OS (HR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.78-0.96, P=0.007) and recurrence-free 
      survival (RFS) (HR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.76-0.94, P=0.002) survival for operable NSCLC 
      when compared with treatment with surgery alone. Although the current consensus 
      recommends the use of post-operative chemotherapy, pre-operative chemotherapy has 
      equivalent efficacy. Both strategies should be regarded as the first choice 
      treatment options. Despite Burdett's comment, indication of pre-operative 
      chemotherapy for stage IA disease should be judged carefully.

AB  - CONTEXT: While vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy and mammalian 
      target of rapamycin inhibition are effective strategies in treating clear cell renal 
      cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most effective therapeutic approach for patients with 
      non-clear cell RCC (non-ccRCC) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review 
      relevant literature comparing the oncological outcomes and adverse events of 
      different systemic therapies for patients with metastatic non-ccRCC. EVIDENCE 
      ACQUISITION: Relevant databases including MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library 
      were searched up to March 24, 2016. Only comparative studies were included. Risk of 
      bias and confounding assessments were performed. A meta-analysis was planned for and 
      only performed if methodologically appropriate; otherwise, a narrative synthesis was 
      undertaken. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The literature search identified 812 potential 
      titles and abstracts. Five randomized controlled trials, recruiting a total of 365 
      patients, were included. Three studies compared sunitinib against everolimus, one of 
      which reported the results for non-ccRCC as a subgroup rather than as an entire 
      randomized cohort. Individually, the studies showed a trend towards favoring 
      sunitinib in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS; 
      Everolimus versus Sunitinib in Patients with Metastatic Non-clear Cell Renal Cell 
      Carcinoma hazard ratio [HR]: 1.41, 80% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.92 and 1.41, 
      95% CI: 0.88-2.27, Evaluation in Metastatic Non-clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma HR: 
      1.16, 95% CI: 0.67-2.01, Efficacy and Safety Comparison of RAD001 Versus Sunitinib 
      in the First-line and Second-line Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Renal Cell 
      Carcinoma HR: 1.5, 95% CI: 0.9-2.8), but this trend did not reach statistical 
      significance in any study. Meta-analysis was performed on two studies which solely 
      recruited patients with non-ccRCC reporting on PFS, the results of which were 
      inconclusive (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 0.91-1.86). Sunitinib was associated with more Grade 
      3-4 adverse events than everolimus, although this was not statistically significant. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis represent a robust summary of 
      the evidence base for systemic treatment of metastatic non-ccRCC. The results show a 
      trend towards favoring vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy for PFS 
      and overall survival compared with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, 
      although statistical significance was not reached. The relative benefits and harms 
      of these treatments remain uncertain. Further research, either in the form of an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis involving all relevant trials, or a randomized 
      controlled trial with sufficient power to detect potential differences between 
      treatments, is needed. PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the literature to determine the 
      most effective treatments for advanced kidney cancer patients whose tumors are not 
      of the clear cell subtype. The results suggest that a drug called sunitinib might be 
      more effective than everolimus, but the statistics supporting this statement are not 
      yet entirely reliable. Further research is required to clarify this unmet medical 
      need.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous clinical trials have reported that electrical stimulation (ES) 
      combined with pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) can be used to treat postpartum 
      urinary incontinence (PPUI) effectively. However, no systematic review has 
      investigated the effectiveness and safety of ES plus PFMT for the treatment of 
      patients with PPUI. In this systematic review, we will firstly assess the 
      effectiveness and safety of ES and PFMT for treating PPUI. METHODS: In this study, 
      we will search the following electronic databases: Cochrane Library, Web of Science, 
      Springer, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 
      Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, 
      and China National Knowledge Infrastructure from inceptions to the present without 
      language restrictions. All eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the 
      effectiveness of ES plus PFMT for PPUI will be included. We will also search grey 
      literature to avoid missing any other potential qualified studies. Two authors will 
      independently conduct the study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias 
      assessment. A third author will be consulted to solve any disagreements between 2 
      authors. RevMan 5.3 Software will be used to pool the data and to carry out the 
      meta-analysis. RESULTS: This study will provide high quality evidence of ES and PFMT 
      for PPUI. The primary outcome includes symptoms improvement. The secondary outcomes 
      consist of incontinence-specific quality of life, clinician's observations, and 
      adverse effects. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study will summary up-to-dated 
      evidence for judging whether ES combined PFMT is an effective intervention for PPUI 
      or not. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study does not needs ethical approval, 
      because it will not involve individual patient data. Its findings will be 
      disseminated through peer-reviewed journals. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: 
      CRD42019122540.

TI  - A Meta-analysis to Compare Four-layer to Short-stretch Compression Bandaging for 
      Venous Leg Ulcer Healing.
PG  - 30-37
AB  - Compression therapy is the standard of care for venous leg ulcers (VLUs), and some 
      evidence suggests 4-layer compression is more effective than short-stretch bandages. 
      A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effectiveness of these 2 compression 
      bandages for venous ulcer healing. In March 2016, a systematic review of the 
      literature was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials. Databases used 
      included Pubmed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, the Cumulative Index of Nursing 
      and Allied Health Literature, and the Latin American and Caribbean of Health 
      Sciences Information System. Search terms were varicose ulcer, venous leg ulcer, 
      venous ulceration, leg ulcer, compression bandages, compressive therapy, multilayer 
      system, four-layer system, elastic bandages, short-stretch bandage, short-stretch 
      system, and inelastic bandage. No publication time or language restrictions were 
      imposed, but findings subjected to analysis were limited to results of research that 
      reported healing and healing time using 4-layer and short-stretch compression only. 
      The quality of the studies was assessed using the Jadad scale. Data extracted 
      included study design, country, target population demographics, VLU clinical aspects 
      at baseline, sample size, interventions applied, follow-up period, complete healing, 
      and healing time as outcomes. Relative risk was calculated considering a 95% 
      confidence interval for dichotomous variables (complete healing), and heterogeneity 
      was statistically assessed among the studies using the chi-squared test assuming 
      random effect when I2 ≥50%. The search yielded 557 papers; 21 met the study criteria 
      for full-text analysis, and 7 met the meta-analysis inclusion criteria. The studies 
      included 1437 patients, average age 70 (range 23-97) years with 1446 venous leg 
      ulcers. Most (5) studies were classified as being at low risk of bias. At 12 and 16 
      weeks, 259 ulcers (51.08%) healed completely in the 4-layer and 234 (46.34%) in the 
      short-stretch bandage groups, respectively (P = .41). At 24 weeks, 268 ulcers 
      (69.07%) in the 4-layer and 257 (62.23%) in the short-stretch bandage groups, 
      respectively, had healed (P = .16). The 2 bandage systems evaluated were similar in 
      achieving complete healing at their respective study endpoints. The average time for 
      healing was 73.6 ± 14.64 days in the 4-layer and 83.8 ± 24.89 days in the 
      short-stretch bandage groups; no meta-analysis was done for this outcome due the 
      inability to retrieve all the individual patient data for each study. The choice of 
      compression system remains at the discretion of the clinicians based on evidence of 
      effectiveness, patient tolerability, and preference. Additional randomized 
      controlled trials to compare various wound and patient outcomes between different 
      compression systems are warranted.

AB  - The spectacular outcomes of the phase III trials regarding nivolumab versus 
      ipilimumab in fully resected stage IIIB/C-IV and of the combination of dabrafenib 
      (D) plus trametinib (T) in BRAF-mutant stage III patients demonstrate that effective 
      treatments in advanced melanoma are also highly effective in the adjuvant setting. 
      In 2016, an overall survival benefit with adjuvant high-dose ipilimumab was 
      demonstrated, and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
      trial 1325 comparing pembrolizumab versus placebo will complete the picture in the 
      early 2018. Toxicity profiles are in line with the experience in advanced melanoma, 
      i.e. favourable for the anti-PD1 agents and for D + T and problematic for 
      ipilimumab. The 2017 outcomes are practice changing and put an end to the use of 
      interferon (IFN) and ipilimumab. In countries with only access to IFN, its use can 
      be restricted to patients with ulcerated melanoma, based on the individual 
      patient data meta-analysis recently published. Because of the results of the 
      Melanoma Sentinel Lymph node Trial-2 (MSLT-2) trial, completion lymph node 
      dissection (CLND) will decrease sharply, leading to a lack of optimal prognostic 
      information. Prognosis in sentinel node-positive stage IIIA/B patients is extremely 
      heterogeneous with 5-year survival rates varying from 90% to 40% and depends mostly 
      on the number of positive nodes identified by CLND. This information is crucial for 
      clinical decision-making. How to guarantee optimal staging information needs to be 
      discussed urgently. Further improvements of adjuvant therapies will have to address 
      all these questions as well as the exploration of neoadjuvant use of active drugs 
      and combination approaches. Important paradigm shifts in the management of high-risk 
      melanoma patients are upon us.

TI  - Why choose high volume online post-dilution hemodiafiltration?
PG  - 181-186
LID - 10.1007/s40620-016-0343-0 [doi]
AB  - The mortality rate of patients on maintenance dialysis remains alarmingly high, at 
      approximately 15-20 % per year. Increasing dialyzer urea clearance has not been 
      shown to improve survival and hence interest has shifted towards convective 
      therapies, such as hemodiafiltration (HDF) which can remove middle molecular weight 
      uremic toxins, which have been suggested to increase mortality in patients with 
      end-stage kidney disease. During the last few years, four large prospective 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted in different European 
      countries to compare survival outcomes in prevalent patients receiving conventional 
      hemodialysis with online post-dilution HDF (OL HDF). Furthermore, a pooled 
      individual participant data analysis from four RCTs was performed and four large 
      meta-analyses on convective therapies have been published in the last 2 years. Taken 
      together, these studies support the conclusion that high volume post-dilution OL HDF 
      is associated with improved overall survival. This advantage results predominantly 
      from a lower cardiovascular mortality, possibly due to better preservation of left 
      ventricle mass and function. Improved intra-dialytic blood pressure stability may 
      contribute to the beneficial effect of high volume post-dilution OL HDF on survival. 
      The beneficial effect is not restricted to selected subgroups, such as age, 
      comorbidity or dialysis vintage. There is no compelling evidence that high volume 
      post-dilution OL HDF reduces mortality by improvements in traditional and 
      non-traditional risk factors. There are still no studies or case reports published 
      describing adverse clinical outcomes in more than 20 years of HDF clinical 
      experience. In conclusion, most of the available data support the choice of high 
      volume post-dilution HDF over the current dialysis techniques. However, considering 
      that we live in the era of evidence-based medicine, the evidence supporting the 
      superiority of high volume post-dilution OL HDF in comparison to hemodialysis is 
      still missing: in fact, a new RCT targeting different convection volumes would be 
      needed to definitively examine the dose-response effect shown in previous studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence about the safety and efficacy of tramadol in 
      pain relief during diagnostic outpatient hysteroscopy (OH). DESIGN: Systematic 
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. SETTING: Not applicable. 
      PATIENT(S): Patients undergoing diagnostic OH received tramadol versus those who 
      were administered placebo. INTERVENTION(S): Electronic databases were searched using 
      the following MeSH terms (tramadol OR opioids OR opioid OR narcotic OR narcotics) 
      AND (hysteroscopy OR hysteroscopic). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pain assessed by 
      visual analogue scale (VAS) during OH, immediately and 30 minutes after the 
      procedure. RESULT(S): One hundred thirteen studies were identified of which four 
      randomized clinical trials were deemed eligible for this review (tramadol: n = 209; 
      placebo: n = 209). The pooled estimate showed that tramadol significantly reduced 
      VAS during procedure than placebo (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -1.33; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] -1.78 to -0.88, I(2) = 3%, P = .36). In addition, tramadol 
      significantly reduced VAS immediately after the procedure (WMD = -1.05; 95% CI -1.49 
      to -0.61, I(2)= 0, P = .84) and 30 minutes after (WMD = -0.98; 95% CI -1.30 to 
      -0.65, I(2) = 0, P = .88). CONCLUSION(S): This meta-analysis suggests that tramadol 
      is safe, effective, and gives favorable results in reducing pain during diagnostic 
      OH.

TI  - Correlation of Milestone Restricted Mean Survival Time Ratio With Overall Survival 
      Hazard Ratio in Randomized Clinical Trials of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - e193433

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have unique patterns of response and 
      survival that differ from conventional chemotherapies. Novel intermediate end points 
      are urgently required to detect the early signals of ICI activity. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate milestone rate (Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival probabilities at given 
      time points) and milestone restricted mean survival time (RMST, the area under 
      survival curves up to given time points) as potential intermediate end points for 
      ICI trials. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (pre-MEDLINE, MEDLINE, Embase, and 
      the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for randomized 
      clinical trials published between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2017. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Phase 2 and phase 3 randomized clinical trials evaluating ICIs in 
      advanced solid tumors. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators extracted 
      the data and reconstructed individual patient data to estimate the milestone rate or 
      milestone RMST from the published Kaplan-Meier curves. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Trial-level milestone rates or milestone RMSTs were estimated for 6-month and 
      9-month progression-free survival (PFS) and 9-month and 12-month overall survival 
      (OS). A weighted linear regression model evaluated the correlations of ratios of 
      milestone rates or milestone RMSTs with OS hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Twenty-six 
      trials examining 8 different tumor types were identified, including 12 892 patients. 
      Overall survival HR was correlated with the ratio of 9-month OS milestone rate 
      (R2 = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.27-0.74), and with the ratio of 12-month OS milestone rate 
      (R2 = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.70). The ratio of 9-month OS milestone RMST (R2 = 0.60; 
      95% CI, 0.28-0.74) and ratio of 12-month OS milestone RMST were correlated with OS 
      HR (R2 = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.78). No correlations were observed between OS HR and 
      the ratio of 6-month or 9-month PFS milestone rates or milestone RMSTs. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: Ratios of OS milestone RMSTs had a stronger correlation with OS HRs 
      than ratios of OS milestone rates, whereas ratios of PFS milestone rates and ratios 
      of PFS milestone RMSTs were not correlated with OS HRs. The OS milestone RMST could 
      be further studied as an intermediate end point in future ICI trials.

TI  - Comparison of three meta-analytic methods using data from digital interventions on 
      type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 59-73
LID - 10.2147/DMSO.S180106 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Pooling the effect sizes of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 
      continuous outcomes, such as glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1c), is an important 
      method in evidence syntheses. However, due to challenges related to baseline 
      imbalances and pre/post correlations, simple analysis of change scores (SACS) and 
      simple analysis of final values (SAFV) meta-analyses result in under- or 
      overestimation of effect estimates. This study was aimed to compare pooled effect 
      sizes estimated by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), SACS, and SAFV meta-analyses, 
      using the example of RCTs of digital interventions with HbA1c as the main outcome. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three databases were systematically searched for RCTs 
      published from 1993 through June 2017. Two reviewers independently assessed titles 
      and abstracts using predefined eligibility criteria, assessed study quality, and 
      extracted data, with disagreements resolved by arbitration from a third reviewer. 
      RESULTS: ANCOVA, SACS, and SAFV resulted in pooled HbA1c mean differences of -0.39% 
      (95% CI: [-0.51, -0.26]), -0.39% (95% CI: [-0.51, -0.26]), and -0.34% (95% CI: 
      [-0.48-0.19]), respectively. Removing studies with both high baseline imbalance 
      (≥±0.2%) and pre/post correlation of ≥±0.6 resulted in a mean difference of -0.39% 
      (95% CI: [-0.53, -0.26]), -0.40% (95% CI: [-0.54, -0.26]), and -0.33% (95% CI: 
      [-0.48, -0.18]) with ANCOVA, SACS, and SAFV meta-analyses, respectively. Substantial 
      heterogeneity was noted. Egger's test for funnel plot symmetry did not indicate 
      evidence of publication bias for all methods. CONCLUSION: By all meta-analytic 
      methods, digital interventions appear effective in reducing HbA1c in type 2 
      diabetes. The effort to adjust for baseline imbalance and pre/post correlation using 
      ANCOVA relies on the level of detail reported from individual studies. Reporting 
      detailed summary data and, ideally, access to individual patient data of 
      intervention trials are essential.

TI  - Are sulfonylurea and insulin therapies associated with a larger risk of cancer than 
      metformin therapy? A retrospective database analysis.
PG  - 59-65
LID - 10.2337/dc14-0977 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several meta-analyses of observational studies suggested that metformin 
      use reduces cancer risk in type 2 diabetes. However, this result was not confirmed 
      by the few available randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and many observational 
      studies on metformin and cancer were potentially afflicted with time-related bias. 
      We aimed to avoid this bias when comparing cancer incidence in users of 
      sulfonylurea, insulin, and other diabetes medications, respectively, with cancer 
      incidence in metformin users. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a retrospective 
      observational study, we used the German Disease Analyzer database with patient data 
      from general practices throughout Germany. The study sample included 22,556 patients 
      diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. During the median follow-up time of 4.8 years, 1,446 
      (6.4%) patients developed any cancer. In Cox regression analyses with either 
      monotherapies or first diabetes medications as drug exposure, users of sulfonylurea 
      (or insulin or other antidiabetes medications) were compared with metformin users. 
      RESULTS: In multivariable adjusted models, hazard ratios were 1.09 (95% CI 
      0.87-1.36) for sulfonylurea monotherapy, 1.14 (95% CI 0.85-1.55) for insulin 
      monotherapy, and 0.94 (95% CI 0.67-1.33) for other diabetes medications compared 
      with metformin monotherapy. Results were similar for comparison of first diabetes 
      medications. CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective database analysis, taking into account 
      potential time-related biases, no reduced cancer risk was found in metformin users. 
      To clarify the association between diabetes medication and cancer risk, further 
      well-designed observational studies and RCTs are needed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative joint disease that eventually 
      leads to disability and poor quality of life. The main symptoms are joint pain and 
      mobility disorders. If the patient has severe pain or other analgesics are 
      contraindicated, opioids may be a viable treatment option. To evaluate and compare 
      the efficacy and safety of opioids in the treatment of knee or hip osteoarthritis, 
      we will integrate direct and indirect evidence using a Bayesian network 
      meta-analysis to establish hierarchies of these drugs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will 
      search the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica 
      database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane 
      Library, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases as well as published and unpublished 
      research in international registries and regulatory agency websites for 
      osteoarthritis reports published prior to 5 January 2018. There will be no 
      restrictions on the language. Randomised clinical trials that compare oral or 
      transdermal opioids with other various opioids, placebo or no treatment for patients 
      with knee or hip osteoarthritis will be included. The primary outcomes of efficacy 
      will be pain and function. We will use pain and function scales to evaluate the main 
      outcomes. The secondary outcomes of safety will be defined as the proportion of 
      patients who have stopped treatment due to side effects. Pairwise meta-analyses and 
      Bayesian network meta-analyses will be performed for all related outcome measures. 
      We will conduct subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness 
      of our findings. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and 
      Evaluations framework will be used to assess the quality of the evidence 
      contributing to each network assessment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study does 
      not require formal ethical approval because individual patient data will not be 
      included. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications or 
      conference presentations. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018085503.

LID - e14145
AB  - BACKGROUND: This systematic review protocol describes the methods that will be used 
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of herbal medicine in treating traumatic brain 
      injury. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following electronic databases will be searched up 
      to December 2018 without language or publication status restrictions: Medline, 
      EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Allied and Complementary 
      Medicine Database, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. We 
      will also search Korean, Chinese, and Japanese databases. Any randomized controlled 
      trials related to herbal medicine for traumatic brain injury will be included. The 
      functional outcome, consciousness state, morbidity, and mortality will be assessed 
      as primary outcomes. The quality of life, adverse events, and total effective rate 
      will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. Two researchers will independently perform 
      the study selection, data extraction, assessment of study quality, and evaluation of 
      the quality of evidence for the main findings. Data synthesis and analysis will be 
      performed using RevMan version 5.3. The results will be expressed as a risk ratio 
      for the binary outcome and as the mean difference or standardized mean difference 
      for a continuous outcome. We will synthesize the data by either fixed effects or 
      random effects model according to a heterogeneity test or the number of studies 
      included in the meta-analysis. The methodological quality of the included studies 
      will be evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. The quality 
      of evidence for each main outcome will be evaluated using the Grading of 
      Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required because individual patient data are 
      not included. The findings of this systematic review will be disseminated through a 
      peer-reviewed publication or conference presentations. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Botulinum Toxin versus Placebo: A Meta-Analysis of Prophylactic Treatment for 
      Migraine.
PG  - 239-250
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000005111 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of botulinum toxin 
      in reducing the frequency of migraine headaches. METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, and 
      Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trials that compared patients receiving botulinum toxin versus 
      placebo injections in the head and neck muscles, for the preventive treatment of 
      migraine. The primary outcome was change in the number of headache episodes per 
      month from baseline to 3 months. RESULTS: There were 17 studies including a total of 
      3646 patients. Overall analysis reported a tendency in favor of botulinum toxin over 
      placebo at 3 months, with a mean difference in the change of migraine frequency of 
      -0.23 (95 percent CI, -0.47 to 0.02; p = 0.08). The reduction in frequency of 
      chronic migraines was significant, with a mean differential change of -1.56 (95 
      percent CI, -3.05 to -0.07; p = 0.04). Analysis of chronic migraine frequency was 
      also significant after 2 months. The findings also highlighted an improvement of the 
      patient's quality of life at 3 months in the botulinum toxin group (p < 0.00001). 
      Further adverse events were traced in the botulinum toxin type A group with a 
      statistically significant risk ratio of 1.32 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This 
      meta-analysis reveals that botulinum toxin type A injections are superior to placebo 
      for chronic migraines after 3 months of therapy. For the first time, a real benefit 
      in patient quality of life is demonstrated with only few and mild adverse events. 
      CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, II.

TI  - Hamstring Autograft versus Patellar Tendon Autograft for ACL Reconstruction: Is 
      There a Difference in Graft Failure Rate? A Meta-analysis of 47,613 Patients.
PG  - 2459-2468
LID - 10.1007/s11999-017-5278-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone-patellar tendon-bone (bone-tendon-bone) and four-strand hamstring 
      tendon grafts (hamstring) are the most commonly utilized autografts for primary 
      anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Existing clinical trials, registry 
      studies, and meta-analyses offer conflicting opinions regarding the most favorable 
      graft choice. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Which graft type for ACL reconstruction 
      (bone-tendon-bone or hamstring) has a higher risk of (1) graft rupture and/or (2) 
      graft laxity? METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and high-quality national registry studies to 
      compare the outcomes of primary ACL reconstruction with bone-tendon-bone autograft 
      or hamstring autograft. Studies that compared these graft types were identified 
      through a comprehensive search of electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 
      the Cochrane Library). Two independent reviewers utilized the Jadad scale for RCT 
      study quality and the Modified Coleman Methodology Score for prospective comparative 
      and registry study quality. The included studies were analyzed for the primary 
      outcome measure of graft rupture with or without revision ACL surgery. In surviving 
      grafts, secondary outcomes of graft laxity were quantified by KT1000/2000™ testing, 
      a positive pivot shift test, and a positive Lachman test. Meta-analysis was 
      performed with Review Manager. A total of 47,613 ACL reconstructions (39,768 
      bone-tendon-bone and 7845 hamstring) from 14 RCTs, 10 prospective comparative 
      studies, and one high-quality national registry study were included in this 
      meta-analysis. Mean age was 28 years in both groups. Sixty-three percent of patients 
      in the bone-tendon-bone cohort were men versus 57% of patients in the hamstring 
      cohort. Mean followup was 68 ± 55 months. RESULTS: Two hundred twelve of 7560 
      (2.80%) bone-tendon-bone grafts ruptured compared with 1123 of 39,510 (2.84%) in the 
      hamstring group (odds ratio = 0.83, 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.96; p = 0.01). 
      The number needed to treat analysis found that 235 patients would need to be treated 
      with a bone-tendon-bone graft over a hamstring tendon graft to prevent one graft 
      rupture. Instrumented laxity analysis showed that 22% (318 of 1433) of patients in 
      the bone-tendon-bone group had laxity compared with 18% (869 of 4783) in the 
      hamstring tendon group (odds ratio = 0.86; p = 0.16). Pivot shift analysis showed a 
      positive pivot shift in 19% (291 of 1508) of the bone-tendon-bone group compared 
      with 17% (844 of 5062) in the hamstring group (odds ratio = 0.89; p = 0.51). Lachman 
      testing showed a positive Lachman in 25% (71 of 280) of patients receiving 
      bone-tendon-bone grafts compared with 25% (73 of 288) in the hamstring group (odds 
      ratio = 0.96; p = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis of short- to mid-term 
      followup after primary ACL reconstruction, hamstring autografts failed at a higher 
      rate than bone-tendon-bone autografts. However, failure rates were low in each 
      group, the difference observed was small, and we observed few differences between 
      graft types in terms of laxity. Both graft types remain viable options for primary 
      ACL reconstruction, and the difference in failure rate should be one part of a 
      larger conversation with each individual patient about graft selection that should 
      also include potential differences in donor site morbidity, complication rates, and 
      patient-reported outcome measures. Continued prospective collection of patient data 
      will be important going forward as we attempt to further characterize the potential 
      differences in outcomes attributable to graft selection. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 
      III, therapeutic study.

TI  - Efficacy of Zofenopril Compared With Placebo and Other Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 
      Inhibitors in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction and Previous Cardiovascular 
      Risk Factors: A Pooled Individual Data Analysis of 4 Randomized, Double-blind,

AB  - In the Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-term Evaluation (SMILE) 1, 3, and 4 
      studies, early administration of zofenopril in acute myocardial infarction showed to 
      be prognostically beneficial versus placebo or ramipril. The SMILE-2 showed that 
      both zofenopril and lisinopril are safe and showed no significant differences in the 
      incidence of major cardiovascular (CV) complications. In this pooled analysis of 
      individual data of the SMILE studies, we evaluated whether the superior efficacy of 
      zofenopril is maintained also in patients with ≥1 CV risk factor (CV+, n = 2962) as 
      compared to CV- (n = 668). The primary study end point was set to 1-year combined 
      occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes. The risk of CV events was 
      significantly reduced with zofenopril versus placebo either in the CV+ (-37%; hazard 
      ratio: 0.63; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.78; P = 0.0001) or in the CV- group 
      (-55%; hazard ratio: 0.45; 0.26-0.78; P = 0.004). Also, the other 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced the risk of major CV outcomes, 
      though the reduction was not statistically significant versus placebo (CV+: 0.78; 
      0.58-1.05; P = 0.107; CV-: 0.71; 0.36-1.41; P = 0.334). The benefit was larger in 
      patients treated with zofenopril than other angiotensin-converting enzyme 
      inhibitors, with a statistically significant difference for CV+ (0.79; 0.63-0.99; P 
      = 0.039) versus CV- (0.62; 0.37-1.06; P = 0.081). In conclusion, zofenopril 
      administered to patients after acute myocardial infarction has a positive impact on 
      prognosis, regardless of the patient's CV risk profile.

TI  - Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk 
      of preterm birth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory morbidity including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a 
      serious complication of preterm birth and the primary cause of early neonatal 
      mortality and disability. While researching the effects of the steroid dexamethasone 
      on premature parturition in fetal sheep in 1969, Liggins found that there was some 
      inflation of the lungs of lambs born at gestations at which the lungs would be 
      expected to be airless. Liggins and Howie published the first randomised controlled 
      trial in humans in 1972 and many others followed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects 
      of administering a course of corticosteroids to the mother prior to anticipated 
      preterm birth on fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, maternal mortality and 
      morbidity, and on the child in later life. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane 
      Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (17 February 2016) and reference lists of 
      retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered all randomised controlled 
      comparisons of antenatal corticosteroid administration (betamethasone, 
      dexamethasone, or hydrocortisone) with placebo, or with no treatment, given to women 
      with a singleton or multiple pregnancy, prior to anticipated preterm delivery 
      (elective, or following spontaneous labour), regardless of other co-morbidity, for 
      inclusion in this review. Most women in this review received a single course of 
      steroids; however, nine of the included trials allowed for women to have weekly 
      repeats. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed 
      trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. 
      The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: 
      This update includes 30 studies (7774 women and 8158 infants). Most studies are of 
      low or unclear risk for most bias domains. An assessment of high risk usually meant 
      a trial had potential for performance bias due to lack of blinding. Two trials had 
      low risks of bias for all risk of bias domains.Treatment with antenatal 
      corticosteroids (compared with placebo or no treatment) is associated with a 
      reduction in the most serious adverse outcomes related to prematurity, including: 
      perinatal death (average risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 
      0.89; participants = 6729; studies = 15; Tau² = 0.05, I² = 34%; moderate-quality); 
      neonatal death (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81; participants = 7188; studies = 22), 
      RDS (average RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.77; participants = 7764; studies = 28; Tau² = 
      0.06, I² = 48%; moderate-quality); moderate/severe RDS (average RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 
      to 0.91; participants = 1686; studies = 6; Tau² = 0.14, I² = 52%); intraventricular 
      haemorrhage (IVH) (average RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.76; participants = 6093; 
      studies = 16; Tau² = 0.10, I² = 33%; moderate-quality), necrotising enterocolitis 
      (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.78; participants = 4702; studies = 10); need for 
      mechanical ventilation (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.84; participants = 1368; studies = 
      9); and systemic infections in the first 48 hours of life (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to 
      0.88; participants = 1753; studies = 8).There was no obvious benefit for: chronic 
      lung disease (average RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.79; participants = 818; studies = 6; 
      Tau² = 0.38 I² = 65%); mean birthweight (g) (MD -18.47, 95% CI -40.83 to 3.90; 
      participants = 6182; studies = 16; moderate-quality); death in childhood (RR 0.68, 
      95% CI 0.36 to 1.27; participants = 1010; studies = 4); neurodevelopment delay in 
      childhood (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.98; participants = 82; studies = 1); or death 
      into adulthood (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.81; participants = 988; studies = 
      1).Treatment with antenatal corticosteroids does not increase the risk of 
      chorioamnionitis (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.06; participants = 5546; studies = 15; 
      moderate-quality evidence) or endometritis (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.63; 
      participants = 4030; studies = 10; Tau² = 0.11, I² = 28%; moderate-quality). No 
      increased risk in maternal death was observed. However, the data on maternal death 
      is based on data from a single trial with two deaths; four other trials reporting 
      maternal death had zero events (participants = 3392; studies = 5; 
      moderate-quality).There is no definitive evidence to suggest that antenatal 
      corticosteroids work differently in any pre-specified subgroups (singleton versus 
      multiple pregnancy; membrane status; presence of hypertension) or for different 
      study protocols (type of corticosteroid; single course or weekly repeats).GRADE 
      outcomes were downgraded to moderate-quality. Downgrading decisions (for perinatal 
      death, RDS, IVH, and mean birthweight) were due to limitations in study design or 
      concerns regarding precision (chorioamnionitis, endometritis). Maternal death was 
      downgraded for imprecision due to few events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from 
      this update supports the continued use of a single course of antenatal 
      corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturation in women at risk of preterm 
      birth. A single course of antenatal corticosteroids could be considered routine for 
      preterm delivery. It is important to note that most of the evidence comes from high 
      income countries and hospital settings; therefore, the results may not be applicable 
      to low-resource settings with high rates of infections.There is little need for 
      further trials of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids versus placebo in 
      singleton pregnancies in higher income countries and hospital settings. However, 
      data are sparse in lower income settings. There are also few data regarding risks 
      and benefits of antenatal corticosteroids in multiple pregnancies and other 
      high-risk obstetric groups. Further information is also required concerning the 
      optimal dose-to-delivery interval, and the optimal corticosteroid to use.We 
      encourage authors of previous studies to provide further information, which may 
      answer any remaining questions about the use of antenatal corticosteroids in such 
      pregnancies without the need for further randomised controlled trials. Individual 
      patient data meta-analysis from published trials is likely to answer some of the 
      evidence gaps. Follow-up studies into childhood and adulthood, particularly in the 
      late preterm gestation and repeat courses groups, are needed. We have not examined 
      the possible harmful effects of antenatal corticosteroids in low-resource settings 
      in this review. It would be particularly relevant to explore this finding in 
      adequately powered prospective trials.

TI  - Management of Aromatase Inhibitor-Associated Bone Loss (AIBL) in postmenopausal 
      women with hormone sensitive breast cancer: Joint position statement of the IOF, 
      CABS, ECTS, IEG, ESCEO IMS, and SIOG.
PG  - 1-12

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several guidelines have been reported for bone-directed treatment in 
      women with early breast cancer (EBC) for averting fractures, particularly during 
      aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. Recently, a number of studies on additional 
      fracture related risk factors, new treatment options as well as real world studies 
      demonstrating a much higher fracture rate than suggested by randomized clinical 
      controlled trials (RCTs). Therefore, this updated algorithm was developed to better 
      assess fracture risk and direct treatment as a position statement of several 
      interdisciplinary cancer and bone societies involved in the management of 
      AI-associated bone loss (AIBL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic literature review 
      identified recent advances in the management of AIBL. Results with individual agents 
      were assessed based on trial design, size, follow-up, and safety. RESULTS: Several 
      fracture related risk factors in patients with EBC were identified. Although, the 
      FRAX algorithm includes fracture risk factors (RF) in addition to BMD, it does not 
      seem to adequately address the effects of AIBL. Several antiresorptive agents can 
      prevent and treat AIBL. However, concerns regarding compliance and long-term safety 
      remain. Overall, the evidence for fracture prevention is strongest for denosumab 
      60 mg s.c. every 6 months. Additionally, recent studies as well as an individual 
      patient data meta-analysis of all available randomized trial data support additional 
      anticancer benefits from adjuvant bisphosphonate treatment in postmenopausal women 
      with a 34% relative risk reduction in bone metastasis and 17% relative risk decrease 
      in breast cancer mortality that needs to be taken into account when advising on 
      management of AIBL. CONCLUSIONS: In all patients initiating AI treatment, fracture 
      risk should be assessed and recommendation with regard to exercise and 
      calcium/vitamin D supplementation given. Bone-directed therapy should be given to 
      all patients with a T-score<-2.0 or with a T-score of <-1.5 SD with one additional 
      RF, or with ≥2 risk factors (without BMD) for the duration of AI treatment. Patients 
      with T-score>-1.5 SD and no risk factors should be managed based on BMD loss during 
      the first year and the local guidelines for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Compliance 
      should be regularly assessed as well as BMD on treatment after 12 - 24 months. 
      Furthermore, because of the decreased incidence of bone recurrence and breast cancer 
      specific mortality, adjuvant bisphosphonates are recommended for all postmenopausal 
      women at significant risk of disease recurrence.

      5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and folinic acid +/- interventional radioembolization 
      as first-line treatment for patients with unresectable liver-only or 
      liver-predominant metastatic colorectal cancer), SIRFLOX (randomized comparative 
      study of FOLFOX6m plus SIR-Spheres microspheres versus FOLFOX6m alone as first-line 
      treatment in patients with nonresectable liver metastases from primary colorectal 
      carcinoma), and FOXFIRE-Global (assessment of overall survival of FOLFOX6m plus 
      SIR-Spheres microspheres versus FOLFOX6m alone as first-line treatment in patients 
      with nonresectable liver metastases from primary colorectal carcinoma in a 
      randomized clinical study) clinical trials were designed to evaluate the efficacy 
      and safety of combining first-line chemotherapy with selective internal radiation 
      therapy (SIRT) using yttrium-90 resin microspheres, also called transarterial 
      radioembolization. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this analysis is to prospectively combine 
      clinical data from 3 trials to allow adequate power to evaluate the impact of 
      chemotherapy with SIRT on overall survival. METHODS: Eligible patients are adults 
      with histologically confirmed CRC and unequivocal evidence of liver metastases which 
      are not treatable by surgical resection or local ablation with curative intent at 
      the time of study entry. Patients may also have limited extrahepatic metastases. 
      Final analysis will take place when all participants have been followed up for a 
      minimum of 2 years. RESULTS: Efficacy and safety estimates derived using individual 
      participant data (IPD) from SIRFLOX, FOXFIRE, and FOXFIRE-Global will be pooled 
      using 2-stage prospective meta-analysis. Secondary outcome measures include 
      progression-free survival (PFS), liver-specific PFS, health-related quality of life, 
      response rate, resection rate, and adverse event profile. The large study population 
      will facilitate comparisons of low frequency adverse events and allow for more 
      robust safety analyses. The potential treatment benefit in those patients who 
      present with disease confined to the liver will be investigated using 1-stage IPD 
      meta-analysis. Efficacy will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This analysis will assess the impact of SIRT combined with chemotherapy 
      on overall survival in the first-line treatment of metastatic CRC. If positive, the 
      results will change the standard of care for this disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Third molar removal and its impact on quality of life: systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 2477-2489
LID - 10.1007/s11136-018-1889-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the impact of third 
      molar removal on patient's quality of life. METHODS: To address the study purpose, 
      investigators designed and implemented a systematic review. The primary outcome 
      variable was the quality of life after third molar extraction. An electronic search 
      was conducted through March, 2017, on the PUBMED, Virtual Health Library (VHL), Web 
      of Science, and OVID, to identify relevant literatures. Research studies (randomized 
      or non-randomized clinical trials) were included that evaluated the quality of life 
      in individuals before and after third molar extraction, using validated measures of 
      oral health-related quality of life with quantitative approach, besides procedures 
      performed under local anesthesia. The R software was used to measure the mean 
      difference on the quality of life between the preoperative period and follow-up 
      days. RESULTS: A total of 1141 studies were identified. Of this total, 13 articles 
      were selected in the present systematic review, of which six studies were included 
      in the meta-analysis. All of these 13 articles used the OHIP-14, and 4 of this 13 
      used OHQoLUK-16 to evaluate the quality of life. Regarding quality assessment, four 
      of the 13 included studies in this review received a maximum score of 9 points, 
      according to the Newcastle-Ottawa (NOS). The OHIP-14 mean score on the first 
      postoperative day was 17.57 (95% CI 11.84-23.30, I(2) = 96%) higher than the 
      preoperative period. On the seventh postoperative day, the quality of life assessed 
      by OHIP-14 got worse again. CONCLUSION: This systematic review revealed that the 
      highest negative impact on quality of life of individuals submitted to third molar 
      surgery was observed on the first postoperative day, decreasing over the follow-up 
      period.

TI  - First-line therapy for non-transplant eligible patients with multiple myeloma: 
      direct and adjusted indirect comparison of treatment regimens on the existing market 
      in Germany.
PG  - 257-65
LID - 10.1007/s00228-015-1998-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare approved first-line therapies 
      for patients with multiple myeloma. METHODS: A systematic literature search for 
      phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing first-line chemotherapies 
      approved in Germany and recommended by guidelines at the time of study design was 
      conducted. Random-effects meta-analysis (MA) was used for direct and the Bucher 
      method for adjusted indirect treatment comparison. RESULTS: One RCT comparing 
      melphalan and prednisone plus bortezomib (VMP) vs. melphalan and prednisone (MP) and 
      six RCTs comparing MP plus thalidomide (MPT) vs. MP were analysed. For MPT vs. MP, 
      an individual patient data (IPD) MA was used for sensitivity analyses. VMP and MPT 
      were superior to MP regarding efficacy endpoints (VMP vs. MP, overall survival (OS): 
      hazard ratio (HR) 0.70, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.86; progression-free 
      survival (PFS): HR 0.56, 0.39-0.79; complete response (CR), risk-ratio (RR) for 
      non-response: 0.70, 0.65-0.75; MPT vs. MP, OS: HR 0.83, 0.66-1.03; PFS: HR 0.67, 
      0.56-0.81; CR, RR for non-response 0.92, 0.88-0.95); but had a higher risk of 
      developing any grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) (VMP vs. MP: RR 1.13, 1.06-1.20; MPT 
      vs. MP: RR 2.06, 1.43-2.98). The indirect comparison of VMP vs. MPT via MP showed a 
      statistically not significant advantage for VMP regarding survival outcomes (OS: HR 
      0.85, 0.63-1.14; PFS: HR 0.83, 0.56-1.23) and a significant advantage regarding CR 
      (RR for non-response 0.76, 0.70-0.83) and AEs (RR 0.55, 0.38-0.80). Treatment 
      comparisons using results of IPD MA yielded similar effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: VMP 
      and MPT seem more effective than MP, VMP was superior to MPT regarding response 
      criteria and AEs. Our results may best be confirmed by a head-to-head trial of VMP 
      vs. MPT.

TI  - A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of low-level laser therapy 
      (LLLT) on chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in pediatric and young patients.
PG  - 7-17
LID - 10.1007/s00431-017-3043-4 [doi]
AB  - Oral mucositis is one of the most frequent complications after chemotherapy, 
      occurring in approximately 52 to 80% of children receiving treatment for cancer. 
      Recently, it has been suggested that the use of low-energy laser could reduce the 
      grade of oral mucositis and alleviate the symptoms. In 2014, Multinational 
      Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology has 
      recommended low-level laser therapy in prevention of mucositis for hematopoietic 
      stem cell transplantation patients because of its beneficial effects in majority of 
      recent studies. However, the recommendation was made for adult patients, not 
      pediatric patients. Data about the effect of low-level laser therapy in pediatric 
      patients is limited. This study aims to synthesize the available clinical evidences 
      on the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in the prevention and treatment of 
      chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis (OM). A meta-analysis was performed using trials 
      identified through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, 
      MEDLINE, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine (CBM), Wanfang Database, and China 
      National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Data on occurrence, duration, and severity 
      of oral mucositis were collected. All randomized controlled studies and clinical 
      controlled studies comparing LLLT to routine qualified prevention or treatment 
      during or after chemotherapy were critically appraised and analyzed. We found 8 
      qualified clinical trials with a total of 373 pediatric patients; the methodological 
      quality was acceptable. After prophylactic LLLT, the odds ratio for developing OM 
      was significantly lower compared with placebo(OR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.87, 
      P = 0.01), the odds ratio for developing grade III OM or worse was statistically 
      significantly lower compared with placebo (OR = 0.30, 95% CI (0.10, 0.90), 
      P = 0.03), and the OM severity was statistically significantly lower compared with 
      placebo (SMD = - 0.56, 95% CI (- 0.98, - 0.14), P = 0.009). For therapeutic LLLT, 
      the OM severity was significantly reduced compared to routine care (SMD = - 1.18, 
      95% CI (- 1.52, - 0.84), P < 0.00001). Oral pain was also reduced after LLLT over 
      routine care (MD = - 0.73, 95% CI (- 1.36, - 0.11), P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: 
      Prophylactic LLLT reduces mucositis and severe mucositis and decreases the average 
      severity of oral mucositis in pediatric and young patients with cancer. Therapeutic 
      LLLT also reduces the average severity of oral mucositis and oral pain. Further 
      research should investigate the optimal parameter of LLLT in pediatric and young 
      patients, and studies with higher methodological quality should be performed. What 
      is known: • Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) was recommended by Multinational 
      Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology; 
      however, evidences about LLLT on oral mucositis in pediatric and young patients were 
      insufficient and lack supportive synthesized data. • Recently, there have been 
      several new RCTs or CCTs for pediatric patients or young adults. What is new: • 
      Prophylactic LLLT reduces the occurrence of mucositis and severe mucositis and 
      decreases the average severity of oral mucositis in pediatric and young patients. • 
      Therapeutic LLLT reduces the average severity of oral mucositis and oral pain.

AB  - AIMS: To determine the causes of adverse reactions associated with Xuebijing 
      injection and provide medical evidence for its safe and rational post-marketing use 
      in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used prospective nested case-control 
      and prescription sequence analysis designs. Using data from the Hospital Information 
      System, patients exhibiting trigger signals after receiving Xuebijing injection were 
      classified as suspected allergic patients. Logistic regression analysis was 
      performed on the risk factors associated with Xuebijing-induced allergic reactions. 
      Randomized controlled and cohort studies on adverse drug reactions to Xuebijing 
      injection were screened from databases and the results were subjected to 
      meta-analysis. RESULTS: The overall incidence of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis 
      tended to increase with dosage and patient's age. Moreover, compared with Xuebijing 
      alone, co-administration of Xuebijing with other drugs or agents (including Ringer's 
      sodium acetate solution, reduced glutathione, aspirin-DL-lysine, and torasemide) 
      increased the risk of adverse reactions. The use of glucose as a vehicle also 
      provoked a greater incidence of allergic reactions than that by the use of 0.9% w/v 
      sodium chloride as a vehicle. Adverse reactions occurred more frequently in patients 
      receiving indicated dosages than in those receiving off-label dosages. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Adverse reactions to Xuebijing injections were correlated with vehicle type, dosage, 
      age, and drug combination. There was no clear association between patient's 
      condition at admission and suspected adverse reactions to Xuebijing injection. 
      Factors influencing the adverse reactions to Xuebijing injection must be fully 
      considered in clinical practice.

TI  - Influence of Anesthesia Type on Outcomes after Endovascular Treatment in Acute 
      Ischemic Stroke: Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 17-26
LID - 10.5469/neuroint.2019.00045 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess clinical and angiographic outcomes after endovascular treatment 
      (EVT) in ischemic stroke patients according to anesthesia types (general anesthesia 
      vs. conscious sedation). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature review 
      through an online data base between January 1990 and September 2017 was performed. A 
      fixed effect model was used in cases of <50% heterogeneity. The primary outcomes 
      were good clinical outcome at the 3-month follow-up and successful recanalization. A 
      meta-regression analysis was done to estimate primary outcomes of log odds ratio 
      (OR) on onset-to-puncture time (OTP) differences. Publication bias was determined 
      using Begg's funnel plot and additional the Trim and Fill method. RESULTS: Sixteen 
      articles including 2,662 patients (general anesthesia, n=1,275; conscious sedation, 
      n=1,387) were included. General anesthesia significantly decreased good outcomes 
      than conscious sedation (OR, 0.564; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.354-0.899). 
      However, outcomes did not differ significantly in randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs; OR, 1.101; 95% CI, 0.395-3.071). Anesthesia type was not associated with 
      successful recanalization (OR, 0.985; 95% CI, 0.787-1.233). General anesthesia 
      increased the risk of mortality (OR, 1.532; 95% CI, 1.187-1.976) and pneumonia (OR, 
      1.613; 95% CI, 1.172-2.221), but not symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 1.125; 
      95% CI, 0.767-1.652). The meta-regression analysis showed no linear relationship 
      between OTP differences and log OR of good outcome (coefficient, 0.0004; P=0.95) or 
      successful recanalization (coefficient, 0.0005; P=0.94), respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      General anesthesia seemed to be associated with adverse clinical outcome after EVT. 
      However, its efficacy was not demonstrated in RCTs. Successful recanalization did 
      not differ according to anesthesia type. Studies using individual patient data based 
      on further RCTs are necessary to elucidate anesthesia effect on procedural and 
      clinical outcomes.

TI  - Potentiators (specific therapies for class III and IV mutations) for cystic 
      fibrosis.
PG  - CD009841
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009841.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited life-shortening illness in 
      Caucasians and caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the cystic fibrosis 
      transmembrane regulator protein (CFTR), which functions as a salt transporter. This 
      mutation most notably affects the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. Excess 
      salt absorption by defective CFTR dehydrates the airway lining and leads to 
      defective mucociliary clearance. Consequent accumulation of thick, sticky mucus 
      makes the airway prone to chronic infection and progressive inflammation; 
      respiratory failure often ensues. Additionally, abnormalities with CFTR lead to 
      systemic complications like malnutrition, diabetes and subfertility.Since the 
      discovery of the causative gene, our understanding of the structure and function of 
      CFTR and the impact of different mutations has increased and allowed pharmaceutical 
      companies to design new mutation-specific therapies targeting the underlying 
      molecular defect. Therapies targeting mutation classes III and IV (CFTR 
      potentiators) aim to normalise airway surface liquid and help re-establish 
      mucociliary clearance, which then has a beneficial impact on the chronic infection 
      and inflammation that characterizes lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. 
      These therapies may also affect other mutations. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects 
      of CFTR potentiators on clinically important outcomes in children and adults with 
      cystic fibrosis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials 
      Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals 
      and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant 
      articles and reviews. Last search: 05 March 2015.We searched the EU Clinical Trials 
      Register, clinicaltrials.gov (US Clinical Trials Register) and the International 
      Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Last search of clinical trial registries: 
      06 February 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of parallel 
      design comparing CFTR potentiators to placebo in people with cystic fibrosis. In a 
      post hoc change we excluded trials combining CFTR potentiators with other 
      mutation-specific therapies. These will be considered in a separate review. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors independently extracted data and assessed the 
      risk of bias in included trials; they contacted trial authors for additional data. 
      Meta-analyses were undertaken on outcomes at a number of time points. MAIN RESULTS: 
      We included four randomised controlled trials (n = 378), lasting from 28 days to 48 
      weeks, comparing the potentiator ivacaftor to placebo. Trials differed in terms of 
      design and participant eligibility criteria, which limited the meta-analyses. The 
      phase 2 trial (n = 19) and two phase 3 trials (adult trial (n = 167), paediatric 
      trial (n = 52)), recruited participants with the G551D mutation (class III). The 
      fourth trial (n = 140) enrolled participants homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation 
      (class II).Risks of bias in the trials were moderate. Random sequence generation, 
      allocation concealment and blinding of trial personnel were well-documented. 
      Participant blinding was less clear throughout all trials; in three trials, some 
      participant data were excluded from the analysis. Selective outcome reporting was 
      apparent in three trials. All trials were sponsored by industry and supported by 
      other non-pharmaceutical funding bodies.No trial reported any deaths. Significantly 
      higher quality of life scores in the respiratory domain were reported by the adult 
      phase 3 G551D trial at 24 weeks, mean difference 8.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      4.77 to 11.43) and 48 weeks, mean difference 8.60 (95% CI 5.27 to 11.93); but not by 
      the paediatric phase 3 G551D trial. The adult phase 3 G551D trial reported 
      improvements in relative change from baseline in forced expiratory volume at one 
      second at 24 weeks, mean difference 16.90% (95% CI 13.60 to 20.20) and 48 weeks, 
      mean difference 16.80% (95% CI 13.50 to 20.10); as did the paediatric G551D trial at 
      24 weeks, mean difference 17.4% (P < 0.0001)). No improvements in quality of life or 
      lung function were reported in the ΔF508 participants.Combined data from both phase 
      3 G551D trials demonstrated increased reporting of cough, odds ratio 0.57 (95% CI 
      0.33 to 1.00) and increased episodes of decreased pulmonary function, odds ratio 
      0.29 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.82) in the placebo group. The adult phase 3 G551D trial 
      demonstrated increased reporting of dizziness amongst the ivacaftor group, OR 10.55 
      (95% CI 1.32 to 84.47). No trial showed a difference between treatment arms in the 
      number of participants interrupting or discontinuing the trial drug.In the phase 3 
      G551D trials, fewer participants assigned to ivacaftor developed serious pulmonary 
      exacerbations. When considering all data for exacerbations, participants taking 
      ivacaftor in the adult phase 3 G551D study developed fewer exacerbations, odds ratio 
      0.54 (95% CI 0.29 to 1.01). In the other G551D studies and in the ΔF508 study, there 
      was no difference between groups in the number of participants who developed 
      pulmonary exacerbations.Combined data from both phase 3 G551D trials demonstrated 
      significant improvements in absolute change from baseline in forced expiratory 
      volume at one second (% predicted) at 24 weeks, mean difference 10.80% (95% CI 8.91 
      to 12.69) and 48 weeks, mean difference 10.44% (95% CI 8.56 to 12.32); also in 
      weight at 24 weeks, mean difference 2.37 kg (95% CI 1.68 to 3.06) and 48 weeks, mean 
      difference 2.75 kg (95% CI 1.74 to 3.75). No improvements in these outcomes were 
      reported in the ΔF508 participants.Significant reductions in sweat chloride 
      concentration were reported in both G551D and ΔF508 participants: in combined data 
      from both phase 3 G551D trials at 24 weeks, mean difference -48.98 mmol/L (95% CI 
      -52.07 to -45.89) and 48 weeks, mean difference -49.03 mmol/L (95% CI -52.11 to 
      -45.94); and from the ΔF508 trial at 16 weeks, mean difference -2.90 mmol/L (95% CI 
      -5.60 to -0.20). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Both G551D phase 3 trials (n = 219) 
      demonstrated a clinically relevant impact of the potentiator ivacaftor on outcomes 
      at 24 and 48 weeks, providing evidence for the use of this treatment in adults and 
      children (over six years of age) with cystic fibrosis and the G551D mutation (class 
      III). There is no evidence to support the use of ivacaftor in people with the ΔF508 
      mutation (class II) (n = 140). Trials on ivacaftor in people with different 
      mutations are ongoing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indacaterol is an inhaled, once-daily, ultra-long-acting β2-agonist for 
      the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We report on the 
      effectiveness of indacaterol and other bronchodilators compared with placebo in 
      patients across the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 
      2011 categories A to D. METHODS: A post-hoc, subgroup pooled analysis of 6-month 
      efficacy data from three randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies 
      involving 3862 patients was performed across GOLD 2011 categories A to D, according 
      to baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) % predicted, modified Medical 
      Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, and exacerbation history in the 12 months 
      prior to entry. Efficacy of once-daily indacaterol 150 and 300 μg, open-label 
      tiotropium 18 μg, twice-daily salmeterol 50 μg, and formoterol 12 μg was compared 
      with placebo. End points analysed were trough FEV1, transition dyspnea index (TDI), 
      and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, all at Week 26, and 
      mean rescue medication use over 26 weeks. RESULTS: Indacaterol 150 and 300 μg 
      significantly improved FEV1, compared with placebo across all GOLD groups. 
      Indacaterol 150 and 300 μg also significantly improved TDI, SGRQ total score, and 
      mean rescue medication use compared with placebo across most GOLD subgroups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Treatment selection according to patient's symptoms as well as lung 
      function is an important consideration in maintenance treatment of COPD. Indacaterol 
      150 and 300 μg effectively improved lung function and symptoms in patients across 
      all GOLD 2011 categories.

TI  - Treatments for preventing recurrence of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 
      people with cystic fibrosis.
PG  - CD012300
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD012300.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD012300
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in cystic fibrosis 
      (CF) is a source of much morbidity and mortality. Eradication of early PA infection 
      is possible, but can recur in many individuals. We sought to examine strategies to 
      delay the time to PA recurrence in people with CF. OBJECTIVES: To establish whether 
      secondary prevention strategies, using antibiotics or other therapies, increase the 
      chances of people with CF remaining free from PA infection following successful 
      eradication therapy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials 
      Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals 
      and conference abstract books. We also searched ongoing trials registries and the 
      reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 21 August 
      2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (and quasi-randomised trials 
      where the risk of bias was low) comparing any treatment modality aimed at preventing 
      recurrence of PA infection with placebo, standard therapy or any other treatment 
      modality in people with CF who have undergone successful eradication of PA. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for 
      inclusion and risk of bias. Quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 
      Conflicts were resolved by discussion and the opinion of a third review author was 
      sought where necessary. Only a subset of participants in the included trial were 
      eligible, therefore individual participant data were requested and obtained from the 
      trial investigators. MAIN RESULTS: We included one trial (n = 306) in the review; 
      however, only 253 participants had undergone successful eradication of PA, so 
      fulfilling the inclusion criteria for our review. Information presented relates only 
      to the included subset of participants. The trial recruited children aged one to 12 
      years (mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of 5.8 (3.5) years), 129 participants 
      (51.0%) were female and the median follow-up was 494 days. We compared cycled 
      therapy with tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS), in which participants underwent 
      28 days of TIS every three months, with culture-based therapy, in which participants 
      were only prescribed medication when a quarterly sputum sample was positive for PA. 
      Reasons for downgrading the quality of the evidence included applicability (only 
      included children), incomplete outcome data and a small number of participants. The 
      time to next isolation of PA was probably shorter with cycled TIS therapy than with 
      culture-based therapy, hazard ratio (HR) 2.04 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      1.28 to 3.26) (moderate-quality evidence). This is in contrast to the main 
      publication of the only included trial, which examined rate of PA positivity rather 
      than time to PA infection and included participants not eligible for inclusion in 
      this review. At the end of the trial, there was no difference between the cycled and 
      culture-based groups in the change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in one 
      second (FEV(1)) L, mean difference (MD) 0.0 L (95% CI -0.09 to 0.09) or in FEV(1) % 
      predicted, MD 0.70% (95% CI -4.33 to 5.73) (both very low-quality evidence). There 
      was no difference in the change from baseline for FVC between the groups. There was 
      also no difference in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations between groups, MD 
      -0.18 (95% CI -0.51 to 0.14) (moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, there was no 
      difference between groups in the risk of participants developing novel resistant 
      bacteria, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.5) (moderate-quality evidence). There were more 
      severe adverse events in the cycled group, but the type of treatment probably makes 
      little or no difference to the results, RR 0.65 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.11) 
      (moderate-quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in the change in 
      weight or height from baseline or in rates of adherence to tobramycin or all trial 
      medicines. The included trial did not assess changes in quality of life, the time to 
      chronic infection with PA or the cost-effectiveness of treatment. AUTHORS' 
      CONCLUSIONS: Cycled TIS therapy may be beneficial in prolonging the time to 
      recurrence of PA after successful eradication, but further trials are required, 
      specifically addressing this question and in both adults and children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To critically evaluate the rehabilitative effects of mindful exercises 
      for poststroke patients. DATA SOURCES: Six databases (PubMed, Physiotherapy Evidence 
      Database, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Wanfang, Chinese National Knowledge 
      Infrastructure) and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials on the effects of mindful exercises on 
      rehabilitative outcomes such as sensorimotor function, gait speed, leg strength, 
      aerobic endurance, cognitive function, and overall motor function. DATA EXTRACTION: 
      Two investigators independently screened eligible studies according to the eligible 
      criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 20 
      studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria were finally included. The sum 
      scores of 5-9 points in the adapted Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale indicates 
      low-to-medium risk of bias. The study results of meta-analysis indicate that mindful 
      exercise intervention was significantly associated with improved sensorimotor 
      function on both lower limb (standardized mean difference=0.79; 95% confidence 
      interval, 0.43-1.15; P<.001; I(2)=62.67%) and upper limb (standardized mean 
      difference=0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-1.01; P<.001; I(2)=32.36%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that mindful exercises are effective in improving 
      sensorimotor function of lower and upper limbs in poststroke patients. The effects 
      on gait speed, leg strength, aerobic endurance, overall motor function, and other 
      outcomes (eg, cognitive function, gait parameters) require further investigation for 
      allowing evidence-based conclusions.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of oxytocin augmentation therapy for schizophrenia: an updated 
      systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials.
PG  - 439-50
LID - 10.1007/s00406-015-0634-9 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and an updated and 
      comprehensive meta-analysis of oxytocin augmentation therapy in patients with 
      schizophrenia who received antipsychotic agents. Data published up to 07/11/2015 
      were obtained from PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases. We conducted a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis of patients' data from randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) comparing oxytocin with placebo. Relative risk (RR), standardized mean 
      difference (SMD), and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) based on the 
      random-effects model were calculated. We included seven RCTs; the total sample size 
      was 206 patients. Oxytocin was superior to placebo for decreasing the Positive and 
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) general subscale scores (SMD = -0.44, 95 % CI -0.82 
      to -0.06, p = 0.02, I (2) = 0 %, N = 4, n = 112); however, it was not different from 
      placebo for total symptoms (SMD = -0.46, 95 % CI -1.20 to 0.28, p = 0.22, I 
      (2) = 80 %, N = 6, n = 162), positive symptoms (SMD = -0.18, 95 % CI -0.87 to 0.51, 
      p = 0.60, I (2) = 81 %, N = 6, n = 192), and negative symptoms (SMD = -0.34, 95 % CI 
      -0.76 to 0.08, p = 0.12, I (2) = 55 %, N = 7, n = 214). However, a sensitivity 
      analysis including only oxytocin administration on consecutive days studies was 
      superior to placebo in negative symptoms (SMD = -0.44, 95 % CI -0.87 to -0.01, 
      p = 0.04, I (2) = 51 %, N = 6 n = 192). There were no significant differences for 
      all-cause discontinuation (RR = 1.02) and individual side effects such as headache 
      and dizziness between oxytocin and placebo. Oxytocin may improve PANSS general 
      subscale scores in schizophrenia and seems to be well tolerated. However, because 
      the number of studies in the current analysis was small, further study will be 
      required using larger sample sizes.

TI  - Change in albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint for progression of kidney disease: a 
      meta-analysis of treatment effects in randomised clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Change in albuminuria has strong biological plausibility as a surrogate 
      endpoint for progression of chronic kidney disease, but empirical evidence to 
      support its validity is lacking. We aimed to determine the association between 
      treatment effects on early changes in albuminuria and treatment effects on clinical 
      endpoints and surrograte endpoints, to inform the use of albuminuria as a surrogate 
      endpoint in future randomised controlled trials. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we 
      searched PubMed for publications in English from Jan 1, 1946, to Dec 15, 2016, using 
      search terms including "chronic kidney disease", "chronic renal insufficiency", 
      "albuminuria", "proteinuria", and "randomized controlled trial"; key inclusion 
      criteria were quantifiable measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria at baseline 
      and within 12 months of follow-up and information on the incidence of end-stage 
      kidney disease. We requested use of individual patient data from the authors of 
      eligible studies. For all studies that the authors agreed to participate and that 
      had sufficient data, we estimated treatment effects on 6-month change in albuminuria 
      and the composite clinical endpoint of treated end-stage kidney disease, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL/min per 1·73 m(2), or doubling of 
      serum creatinine. We used a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression analysis to 
      relate the treatment effects on albuminuria to those on the clinical endpoint across 
      studies and developed a prediction model for the treatment effect on the clinical 
      endpoint on the basis of the treatment effect on albuminuria. FINDINGS: We 
      identified 41 eligible treatment comparisons from randomised trials (referred to as 
      studies) that provided sufficient patient-level data on 29 979 participants (21 206 
      [71%] with diabetes). Over a median follow-up of 3·4 years (IQR 2·3-4·2), 3935 (13%) 
      participants reached the composite clinical endpoint. Across all studies, with a 
      meta-regression slope of 0·89 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 0·13-1·70), each 
      30% decrease in geometric mean albuminuria by the treatment relative to the control 
      was associated with an average 27% lower hazard for the clinical endpoint (95% BCI 
      5-45%; median R(2) 0·47, 95% BCI 0·02-0·96). The association strengthened after 
      restricting analyses to patients with baseline albuminuria of more than 30 mg/g (ie, 
      3·4 mg/mmol; R(2) 0·72, 0·05-0·99]). For future trials, the model predicts that 
      treatments that decrease the geometric mean albuminuria to 0·7 (ie, 30% decrease in 
      albuminuria) relative to the control will provide an average hazard ratio (HR) for 
      the clinical endpoint of 0·68, and 95% of sufficiently large studies would have HRs 
      between 0·47 and 0·95. INTERPRETATION: Our results support a role for change in 
      albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint for the progression of chronic kidney disease, 
      particularly in patients with high baseline albuminuria; for patients with low 
      baseline levels of albuminuria this association is less certain. FUNDING: US

TI  - Effectiveness of person-centered care on people with dementia: a systematic review 
      and meta-analysis.
PG  - 381-397
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S117637 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Person-centered care is a holistic and integrative approach designed to 
      maintain well-being and quality of life for people with dementia, and it includes 
      the elements of care, the individual, the carers, and the family. AIM: A systematic 
      literature review and meta-analysis were undertaken to investigate the effectiveness 
      of person-centered care for people with dementia. METHODS: Literature searches were 
      undertaken using six databases including Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane 
      Database, and KoreaMed using the following keywords: cognition disorder, dementia, 
      person-centered care, patient-centered care, client-centered care, 
      relationship-centered care, and dementia care. The searches were limited to 
      interventional studies written in English and Korean and included randomized 
      controlled studies and noncontrolled studies for people with dementia living in any 
      setting. RESULTS: Nineteen interventional studies, including 3,985 participants, 
      were identified. Of these, 17 studies were from long-term care facilities and two 
      studies were from homecare settings. The pooled data from randomized controlled 
      studies favored person-centered care in reducing agitation, neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms, and depression and improving the quality of life. Subgroup analysis 
      identified greater effectiveness of person-centered care when implemented for people 
      with less severe dementia. For agitation, short-term interventions had a greater 
      effect (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.434; 95% conference interval [CI]: 
      -0.701 to -0.166) than long-term interventions (SMD: -0.098; 95% CI: -0.190 to 
      0.007). Individualized activities resulted in a significantly greater beneficial 
      effect than standard care (SMD: 0.513; 95% CI: -0.994 to -0.032). However, 
      long-term, staff education, and cultural change interventions had a greater effect 
      on improving the quality of life for people with dementia (SMD: 0.191; 95% CI: 0.079 
      to 0.302). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis provided evidence 
      for person-centered care in clinical practice for people with dementia. 
      Person-centered care interventions were shown to reduce agitation, neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms, and depression and to improve the quality of life. Person-centered care 
      interventions can effectively reduce agitation for a short term using intensive and 
      activity-based intervention. However, an educational strategy that promotes learning 
      and skill development of internal care staff is needed to enhance patient's quality 
      of life and to ensure the sustainability of the effects of behavioral problems. The 
      feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention, the severity of patient disease, 
      and intervention type and duration should be considered as part of an intervention 
      design.

TI  - Is Oral Chinese Herbal Medicine Beneficial for Psoriasis Vulgaris? A Meta-Analysis 
      of Comparisons with Acitretin.
PG  - 174-88
LID - 10.1089/acm.2014.0212 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic disease that significantly affects 
      patient's quality of life and poses an economic burden. Acitretin is a 
      second-generation retinoid used for psoriasis in clinical practice. Orally 
      administered Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), alone or combined with acitretin, has 
      been used for the clinical management of psoriasis vulgaris. This systematic review 
      evaluates the efficacy of oral CHM in comparison with acitretin and the add-on 
      effect of oral CHM to acitretin. METHODS: Five English databases and four Chinese 
      databases were searched from their inceptions to May 2014. Included randomized, 
      controlled trials (RCTs) were published in English or Chinese, compared oral CHM or 
      the combination of oral CHM and acitretin with acitretin, and used Psoriasis Area 
      and Severity Index (PASI) as the outcome measure. RESULTS: A total of 25 RCTs were 
      included in this review: 8 studies compared oral CHM with acitretin, 12 compared the 
      combination with acitretin alone, and 5 were three-arm studies that compared both 
      with acitretin. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis indicated that oral CHM was effective 
      for psoriasis vulgaris as follows: (1) Oral CHM is neither superior nor inferior to 
      acitretin, and (2) oral CHM could produce add-on effects when combined with 
      acitretin. Oral CHM itself appeared safe for treating psoriasis vulgaris and 
      possibly could reduce the common adverse events seen with acitretin. However, the 
      long-term effect and safety of oral CHM could not be assessed. Further research 
      should consider including a placebo control and using outcome measures according to 
      international guidelines to evaluate CHM, as well as include follow-ups to monitor 
      longer-term efficacy and safety.

TI  - Meniett Therapy for Ménière's Disease: An Updated Meta-analysis.
PG  - 290-8
LID - 10.1097/MAO.0000000000000957 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To re-evaluate the efficacy of Meniett therapy for the treatment of 
      Ménière's disease (MD). DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, 
      Clinicaltrials.gov, ChiCTR, and the CNKI database were searched for articles in 
      English and Chinese published before August 31, 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Included in 
      this meta-analysis were studies that dealt with outcomes of Meniett therapy for the 
      treatment of MD, including randomized controlled clinical trials, case-control 
      studies, and prospective or retrospective cohort studies, with sample sizes of ≥ 10 
      subjects. DATA EXTRACTION: Keywords included endolymphatic hydrops, Ménière's 
      disease, pressure, Meniett, and transtympanic micropressure treatment. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: Fourteen studies were included, involving a total of 345 MD patients. 
      Data were analyzed using the Meta package in R. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed 
      as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and weighted mean differences with 95% 
      confidence intervals were used to present continuous outcomes. Heterogeneity of the 
      included studies was quantitatively assessed by χ(2) and I tests. Fixed-effects 
      models were used for I(2) <50%; otherwise, random-effects models were used. Funnel 
      plots were constructed to test the publication bias. CONCLUSION: This study showed 
      that Meniett therapy may prevent vertigo attacks and substantially reduce its 
      frequency in MD patients. It may also alleviate the functional deficit. The impact 
      of Meniett therapy on hearing remains uncertain. The optimal effect might maintain 
      for approximately 18 months. This meta-analysis suggested that Meniett therapy may 
      be a useful second-line therapy in the treatment of MD.

TI  - Efficacy of vitamin D in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: A meta-analysis.
PG  - e12662
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000012662 [doi]
LID - e12662
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency is prevalent in patient with inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD). Recent studies have found that VitD can induce and maintain IBD 
      remission through antibiosis, anti-inflammatory, and repair of intestinal mucosal 
      barriers, thus improving the patient's disease activity and quality-of-life. The 
      purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the therapeutic effect and safety of 
      VitD in the treatment of IBD. METHODS: Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      were included from electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of 
      Science, and so forth). Cochrane handbook was applied to evaluate the methodological 
      quality. The levels of 25(OH)D3, relapse rate, inflammation index, and adverse 
      events were compared between the experimental group and the control group (placebo 
      group). All statistical analyses were directed by Revman 5.3 software and 
      statistical significance was defined as P < .05. RESULTS: Eighteen RCTs involved 908 
      patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that VitD improved the 25(OH)D3 levels 
      more significantly than the control group (ng/mL, weighted mean deviation 
      [WMD] = 7.85, 95% CI (5.52, 10.18), P < .000001), and compared with lower doses, 
      there were significant differences increasing 25(OH)D3 levels (WMD = 11.19, 95% CI 
      [4.73, 17.65], P = .0007) in high-dose VitD treatment while there was no significant 
      difference in the adverse events between 2 groups (WMD = 1.56, 95% CI [0.74, 3.29], 
      P = .24). VitD reduced the relapse rate more significantly than the control group, 
      but there were no significant differences between the low-dose and high-dose vitamin 
      D treatment. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP) of the VitD and the control group showed no statistically 
      significant difference (ESR [mm/h]: WMD = -0.22, 95% CI [-5.73, 5.29], P = .94; 
      hsCRP (mg/dL): WMD = -0.53, 95% CI [-1.68, 0.62], P = .37). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      treatment of VitD in patients with IBD can improve the level of 25(OH)D3 and control 
      the relapse rate of the disease, whose clinical curative effect is more accurate. 
      Thus VitD should be recommended for the treatment of IBD, at least as an adjunctive 
      treatment.

      survival and meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While extended criteria lung donation has helped expand the lung donor 
      pool, utilization of lungs from donors of at least one other solid organ is still 
      limited to around 15-30%. Ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) offers the ability to expand 
      the number of useable lung grafts through assessment and reconditioning of explanted 
      lungs, particularly those not initially meeting criteria for transplantation. This 
      meta-analysis aimed to examine the mid- to long-term survival and other short-term 
      outcomes of patients transplanted with EVLP-treated lungs versus 
      standard/cold-storage protocol lungs. METHODS: Literature search of ten medical 
      databases was conducted for original studies involving "ex-vivo lung perfusion" and 
      "EVLP". Included articles were assessed by two independent researchers, survival 
      data from Kaplan-Meier curves digitized, and individual patient data imputed to 
      conduct aggregated survival analysis. Meta-analyses of suitably reported outcomes 
      were conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met inclusion 
      criteria, with a total of 407 EVLP lung transplants and 1,765 as per standard/cold 
      storage protocol. One study was a randomized controlled trial while the remainder 
      were single-institution cohort series of varying design. The majority of donor lungs 
      were from brain death donors, with EVLP lungs having significantly worse 
      PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and significantly greater rate of abnormal chest X-ray. 
      Aggregated survival analysis of all included studies revealed no significant 
      survival difference for EVLP or standard protocol lungs (hazard ratio 1.00; 95% 
      confidence interval: 0.79-1.27, P=0.981). Survival at 12, 24, and 36 months for the 
      EVLP cohort was 84%, 79%, and 74%, respectively. Survival at 12, 24, and 36 months 
      for the standard protocol cohort was 85%, 79%, and 73%, respectively. Meta-analysis 
      did not find a significant difference in risk of 30-day mortality or primary graft 
      dysfunction grade 3 at 72 hours between cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: There was no 
      significant difference in mid- to long-term survival of EVLP lung transplant 
      patients when compared to standard protocol donor lungs. The incidence of 30-day 
      mortality and primary graft dysfunction grade 3 at 72 hours did not differ 
      significantly between groups. EVLP offers the potential to increase lung donor 
      utilization while providing similar short-term outcomes and mid- to long-term 
      survival.

TI  - Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for fibromyalgia.
PG  - CD010292
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010292.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD010292
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is a clinically defined chronic condition of unknown 
      etiology characterized by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep 
      disturbances, cognitive dysfunction and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often 
      report high disability levels and poor quality of life. Drug therapy, for example, 
      with serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), focuses on reducing 
      key symptoms and improving quality of life. This review updates and extends the 2013 
      version of this systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy, tolerability 
      and safety of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) compared with 
      placebo or other active drug(s) in the treatment of fibromyalgia in adults. SEARCH 
      METHODS: For this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the US National 
      Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical 
      Trials Registry Platform for published and ongoing trials and examined the reference 
      lists of reviewed articles, to 8 August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected 
      randomized, controlled trials of any formulation of SNRIs against placebo or any 
      other active treatment of fibromyalgia in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      Three review authors independently extracted data, examined study quality, and 
      assessed risk of bias. For efficacy, we calculated the number needed to treat for an 
      additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for pain relief of 50% or greater and of 30% or 
      greater, patient's global impression to be much or very much improved, dropout rates 
      due to lack of efficacy, and the standardized mean differences (SMD) for fatigue, 
      sleep problems, health-related quality of life, mean pain intensity, depression, 
      anxiety, disability, sexual function, cognitive disturbances and tenderness. For 
      tolerability we calculated number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome 
      (NNTH) for withdrawals due to adverse events and for nausea, insomnia and somnolence 
      as specific adverse events. For safety we calculated NNTH for serious adverse 
      events. We undertook meta-analysis using a random-effects model. We assessed the 
      evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. MAIN RESULTS: We 
      added eight new studies with 1979 participants for a total of 18 included studies 
      with 7903 participants. Seven studies investigated duloxetine and nine studies 
      investigated milnacipran against placebo. One study compared desvenlafaxine with 
      placebo and pregabalin. One study compared duloxetine with L-carnitine. The majority 
      of studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in three to five domains.The quality 
      of evidence of all comparisons of desvenlafaxine, duloxetine and milnacipran versus 
      placebo in studies with a parallel design was low due to concerns about publication 
      bias and indirectness, and very low for serious adverse events due to concerns about 
      publication bias, imprecision and indirectness. The quality of evidence of all 
      comparisons of duloxetine and desvenlafaxine with other active drugs was very low 
      due to concerns about publication bias, imprecision and indirectness.Duloxetine and 
      milnacipran had no clinically relevant benefit over placebo for pain relief of 50% 
      or greater: 1274 of 4104 (31%) on duloxetine and milnacipran reported pain relief of 
      50% or greater compared to 591 of 2814 (21%) participants on placebo (risk 
      difference (RD) 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.11; NNTB 11, 95% CI 9 
      to 14). Duloxetine and milnacipran had a clinically relevant benefit over placebo in 
      patient's global impression to be much or very much improved: 888 of 1710 (52%) on 
      duloxetine and milnacipran (RD 0.19, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.26; NNTB 5, 95% CI 4 to 8) 
      reported to be much or very much improved compared to 354 of 1208 (29%) of 
      participants on placebo. Duloxetine and milnacipran had a clinically relevant 
      benefit compared to placebo for pain relief of 30% or greater. RD was 0.10; 95% CI 
      0.08 to 0.12; NNTB 10, 95% CI 8 to 12. Duloxetine and milnacipran had no clinically 
      relevant benefit for fatigue (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.08; NNTB 18, 95% CI 12 
      to 29), compared to placebo. There were no differences between either duloxetine or 
      milnacipran and placebo in reducing sleep problems (SMD -0.07; 95 % CI -0.15 to 
      0.01). Duloxetine and milnacipran had no clinically relevant benefit compared to 
      placebo in improving health-related quality of life (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.25 to 
      -0.15; NNTB 11, 95% CI 8 to 14).There were 794 of 4166 (19%) participants on SNRIs 
      who dropped out due to adverse events compared to 292 of 2863 (10%) of participants 
      on placebo (RD 0.07, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.10; NNTH 14, 95% CI 10 to 25). There was no 
      difference in serious adverse events between either duloxetine, milnacipran or 
      desvenlafaxine and placebo (RD -0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.00).There was no difference 
      between desvenlafaxine and placebo in efficacy, tolerability and safety in one small 
      trial.There was no difference between duloxetine and desvenlafaxine in efficacy, 
      tolerability and safety in two trials with active comparators (L-carnitine, 
      pregabalin). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The update did not change the major findings of 
      the previous review. Based on low- to very low-quality evidence, the SNRIs 
      duloxetine and milnacipran provided no clinically relevant benefit over placebo in 
      the frequency of pain relief of 50% or greater, but for patient's global impression 
      to be much or very much improved and in the frequency of pain relief of 30% or 
      greater there was a clinically relevant benefit. The SNRIs duloxetine and 
      milnacipran provided no clinically relevant benefit over placebo in improving 
      health-related quality of life and in reducing fatigue. Duloxetine and milnacipran 
      did not significantly differ from placebo in reducing sleep problems. The dropout 
      rates due to adverse events were higher for duloxetine and milnacipran than for 
      placebo. On average, the potential benefits of duloxetine and milnacipran in 
      fibromyalgia were outweighed by their potential harms. However, a minority of people 
      with fibromyalgia might experience substantial symptom relief without clinically 
      relevant adverse events with duloxetine or milnacipran.We did not find 
      placebo-controlled studies with other SNRIs than desvenlafaxine, duloxetine and 
      milnacipran.

TI  - The EMA Review of Mylotarg (Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin) for the Treatment of Acute 
      Myeloid Leukemia.
PG  - e171-e179
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0025 [doi]
AB  - On February 22, 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
      adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization 
      for the medicinal product gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg; Pfizer, New York City, 
      NY), intended for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Mylotarg was designated 
      as an orphan medicinal product on October 18, 2000. The applicant for this medicinal 
      product was Pfizer Limited (marketing authorization now held by Pfizer Europe MA 
      EEIG).The demonstrated benefit with Mylotarg is improvement in event-free survival. 
      This has been shown in the pivotal ALFA-0701 (MF-3) study. In addition, an 
      individual patient data meta-analysis from five randomized controlled trials (3,325 
      patients) showed that the addition of Mylotarg significantly reduced the risk of 
      relapse (odds ratio [OR] 0.81; 95% CI: 0.73-0.90; p = .0001), and improved overall 
      survival at 5 years (OR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82-0.98; p = .01) [Lancet Oncol 
      2014;15:986-996]. The most common (>30%) side effects of Mylotarg when used together 
      with daunorubicin and cytarabine are hemorrhage and infection.The full indication is 
      as follows: "Mylotarg is indicated for combination therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) 
      and cytarabine (AraC) for the treatment of patients age 15 years and above with 
      previously untreated, de novo CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML), except 
      acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)."The objective of this article is to summarize 
      the scientific review done by the CHMP of the application leading to regulatory 
      approval in the European Union. The full scientific assessment report and product 
      information, including the Summary of Product Characteristics, are available on the 
      European Medicines Agency website (www.ema.europa.eu). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: 
      This article reflects the scientific assessment of Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin; 
      Pfizer, New York City, NY) use for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia based on 
      important contributions from the rapporteur and co-rapporteur assessment teams, 
      Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use members, and additional experts 
      following the application for a marketing authorization from the company. It's a 
      unique opportunity to look at the data from a regulatory point of view and the 
      importance of assessing the benefit-risk.

TI  - Comparison operative and conservative management for primary patellar dislocation: 
      an up-to-date meta-analysis.
PG  - 783-8
LID - 10.1007/s00590-014-1523-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this review was to compare the clinical outcomes between 
      operative and conservative management for primary patella dislocation (PPD). 
      METHODS: PubMed Medline, EMBASE, Google scholar, and the Cochrane Library were 
      systematically searched for randomized controlled trials that compared operative 
      technique versus conservative technique for PPD. The results of eligible studies 
      were independently extracted and analyzed according to the following: patient's 
      satisfaction, Kujala score, Tegner score, and redislocation rate. Random-effect and 
      fixed-effect models were adopted to calculate the weight mean difference and the 
      odds ratio for continuous and dichotomous variables with 95 % confidence interval. 
      RESULTS: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 402 (216 surgery and 
      186 conservation) patients available for the present study. A meta-analysis showed 
      no significant differences between the two treatment groups in terms of patient's 
      satisfaction and Kujala score. However, significant differences in Tegner score (P < 
      0.00001) and redislocation rate (P = 0.002) were observed in favor of surgical 
      treatment. In the subgroup analysis, surgical intervention achieved higher (P = 
      0.002) Kujala score in short term (<5 years), while conservation gained advantage (P 
      = 0.003) in long term (>5 years). There was no significant difference in dislocation 
      rate in long term. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment might provide better clinical 
      results in short term. More persuasive evidence is still needed to proof the effect 
      of surgical management in long time.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes: 
      A systematic review and mixed-treatment comparison analysis.
PG  - 524-536
LID - 10.1111/dom.12849 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To compare efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
      (GLP-1RAs) in people with type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We electronically 
      searched, up to June 3, 2016, published randomized clinical trials lasting between 
      24 and 32 weeks that compared a GLP-1RA (albiglutide, dulaglutide, twice-daily 
      exenatide and once-weekly exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide and 
      taspoglutide) with placebo or another GLP-1RA. Data on cardiometabolic and safety 
      outcomes were analysed using a mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis. RESULTS: A 
      total of 34 trials (14 464 participants) met the inclusion criteria; no published 
      data for semaglutide were available. Compared with placebo, all GLP-1RAs reduced 
      glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels (reductions 
      ranged from -0.55% and -0.73 mmol/L, respectively, for lixisenatide to -1.21% and 
      -1.97 mmol/L, respectively, for dulaglutide). There were no differences within 
      short-acting (twice-daily exenatide and lixisenatide) or long-acting (albiglutide, 
      dulaglutide, once-weekly exenatide, liraglutide and taspoglutide) groups. Compared 
      with twice-daily exenatide, dulaglutide treatment was associated with the greatest 
      HbA1c and FPG reduction (0.51% and 1.04 mmol/L, respectively), followed by 
      liraglutide (0.45% and 0.93 mmol/L, respectively) and once-weekly exenatide (0.38% 
      and 0.85 mmol/L, respectively); similar reductions were found when these 3 agents 
      were compared with lixisenatide. Compared with placebo, all GLP-1RAs except 
      albiglutide reduced weight and increased the risk of hypoglycaemia and 
      gastrointestinal side effects, and all agents except dulaglutide and taspoglutide 
      reduced systolic blood pressure. When all GLP-1RAs were compared with each other, no 
      clinically meaningful differences were observed in weight loss, blood pressure 
      reduction or hypoglycaemia risk. Albiglutide had the lowest risk of nausea and 
      diarrhoea and once-weekly exenatide the lowest risk of vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      RCTs in the present analysis show that all GLP-1RAs improve glycaemic control, 
      reduce body weight and increase the risk of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms 
      compared with placebo. Although there were no differences when short-acting agents 
      were compared with each other or when long-acting agents were compared with each 
      other, dulaglutide, liraglutide and once-weekly exenatide were superior to 
      twice-daily exenatide and lixisenatide at lowering HbA1c and FPG levels. There were 
      no differences in hypoglycaemia between these 3 agents, whilst once-weekly exenatide 
      had the lowest risk of vomiting. These results, along with patient's preferences and 
      individualized targets, should be considered when selecting a GLP-1RA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most successful orthopedic 
      surgeries performed in recent decades. However, controversies still exist between 
      conducting simultaneous or staged bilateral TKA. The objective of this study is to 
      conduct a systematic review assessing the clinical outcome associated with 
      simultaneous bilateral and staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty (BTKA). METHODS: 
      A search was applied to CNKI, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane central database 
      (January 2000-July 2018). All studies that compared simultaneous bilateral TKA 
      (simBTKA) with staged bilateral TKA (staBTKA) without language restriction were 
      reviewed, and qualities of included studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa 
      Scale. Data were pooled and a meta-analysis completed. RESULTS: The 18 studies were 
      identified to be eligible. The 18 comparative studies published from 2001 to 2018, 
      covered 73617 participants in the simBTKA group and 61838 in the staBTKA group, 
      respectively. Results of meta-analyses indicated that simBTKA showed a lower risk of 
      deep infection and respiratory complications, but increased mortality, pulmonary 
      embolism (PE), and deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) compared with staBTKA. There were no 
      significant differences in revision, superficial infection, arthrofibrosis, cardiac 
      complications, neurological complications and urinary complications between 
      procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Since there are risks and benefits to both procedures, 
      these potential complications must be interpreted in light of each individual 
      patient's needs and concerns. Further research must be conducted, in the form of a 
      randomized clinical trial, to evaluate the outcomes mentioned in this review.

LID - 10.5867/medwave.2016.6454 [doi]
AB  - Cough represents one of the most common reasons for pediatrician consultations. 
      There are many available treatments for symptomatic relief, including honey. Despite 
      its wide availability, there is little knowledge about its benefits. Searching in 
      Epistemonikos database, which is maintained by screening 30 databases, we identified 
      three systematic reviews including three randomized trials. We combined the evidence 
      using meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings table following the GRADE 
      approach. We concluded the use of honey probably decreases the severity and 
      frequency of cough, improves the quality of parent's and patient's sleep, and does 
      not have side effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate endometrial scratch injury (ESI) as an intervention to 
      improve IVF outcome in women undergoing a first ET. DESIGN: Systematic review and 
      meta-analysis. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Infertile women undergoing a 
      first fresh/frozen embryo transfer. INTERVENTION(S): We included published and 
      unpublished data from randomized controlled trials in which the intervention group 
      received ESI and controls received placebo or no intervention. Pooled results were 
      expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The review 
      protocol was registered in PROSPERO to start the data extraction (CRD42018087786). 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Ongoing pregnancy/live birth rate (OPR/LBR), clinical 
      pregnancy rate (CPR), multiple pregnancy rate (MPR), miscarriage rate (MR), and 
      ectopic pregnancy rate (EPR). RESULT(S): Seven studies were included (1,354 
      participants). We found a nonsignificant difference between groups in terms of 
      OPR/LBR, CPR, MR, MPR, and EPR. Subgroup analysis found that ESI on the day of 
      oocyte retrieval (achieved by a Novak curette) reduced OPR/LBR (RR 0.31, 95% CI 
      0.14-0.69) and CPR (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18-0.71), whereas ESI during the cycle 
      preceding ET (performed through soft devices) had no effect on OPR/LBR and CPR. No 
      difference in the impact of ESI was observed between fresh and frozen embryo 
      transfer. CONCLUSION(S): Current evidence does not support performing ESI with the 
      purpose of improving the success of a first ET attempt.

TI  - Association between age and risk of stroke or death from carotid endarterectomy and 
      carotid stenting: a meta-analysis of pooled patient data from four randomised 
      trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Age was reported to be an effect-modifier in four randomised controlled 
      trials comparing carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA), 
      with better CEA outcomes than CAS outcomes noted in the more elderly patients. We 
      aimed to describe the association of age with treatment differences in symptomatic 
      patients and provide age-specific estimates of the risk of stroke and death within 
      narrow (5 year) age groups. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we analysed individual 
      patient-level data from four randomised controlled trials within the Carotid 
      Stenosis Trialists' Collaboration (CSTC) involving patients with symptomatic carotid 
      stenosis. We included only trials that randomly assigned patients to CAS or CEA and 
      only patients with symptomatic stenosis. We assessed rates of stroke or death in 
      5-year age groups in the periprocedural period (between randomisation and 120 days) 
      and ipsilateral stroke during long-term follow-up for patients assigned to CAS or 
      CEA. We also assessed differences between CAS and CEA. All analyses were done on an 
      intention-to-treat basis. FINDINGS: Collectively, 4754 patients were randomly 
      assigned to either CEA or CAS treatment in the four studies. 433 events occurred 
      over a median follow-up of 2·7 years. For patients assigned to CAS, the 
      periprocedural hazard ratio (HR) for stroke and death in patients aged 65-69 years 
      compared with patients younger than 60 years was 2·16 (95% CI 1·13-4·13), with HRs 
      of roughly 4·0 for patients aged 70 years or older. We noted no evidence of an 
      increased periprocedural risk by age group in the CEA group (p=0·34). These changes 
      underpinned a CAS-versus CEA periprocedural HR of 1·61 (95% CI 0·90-2·88) for 
      patients aged 65-69 years and an HR of 2·09 (1·32-3·32) for patients aged 70-74 
      years. Age was not associated with the postprocedural stroke risk either within 
      treatment group (p≥0·09 for CAS and 0·83 for CEA), or between treatment groups 
      (p=0·84). INTERPRETATION: In these RCTs, CEA was clearly superior to CAS in patients 
      aged 70-74 years and older. The difference in older patients was almost wholly 
      attributable to increasing periprocedural stroke risk in patients treated with CAS. 
      Age had little effect on CEA periprocedural risk or on postprocedural risk after 
      either procedure. FUNDING: None.

TI  - Effects of physical exercises on semen quality and reproductive outcomes in male 
      infertility: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized 
      controlled trials.
PG  - e17494
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000017494 [doi]
LID - e17494
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infertility has troubled the world's 186 million people, and male 
      infertility accounts for more than half. The literature of physical exercise related 
      to semen quality has shown inconsistent results, and there is currently no 
      systematic review to evaluate the effects of exercise on reproductive outcomes in 
      male infertility patients. This study aims to assessing the effects of exercise 
      interventions based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on semen quality and 
      reproductive outcomes in male infertility. METHODS: English and Chinese literature 
      about physical exercise treatment for male infertility published before July 31, 
      2019 will be systematic searched in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane 
      Library, Open Grey, Clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, WANFANG, 
      VIP Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database, CNKI, Chinese biomedical 
      document service system (SinoMed). Only RCTs of patients with male infertility will 
      be included. Literature screening, data extraction, and the assessment of risk of 
      bias will be independently conducted by 2 reviewers, and the 3rd reviewer will be 
      consulted if any different opinions existed. Live-birth rate, pregnancy rate, 
      adverse events (including miscarriage), sperm concentration, progressive motility, 
      sperm morphology, and sperm DNA fragmentation will be evaluated. Systematic review 
      and meta-analysis will be produced by RevMan 5.3 and Stata 14.0. This protocol 
      reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement, and we will report the systematic 
      review by following the PRISMA statement. CONCLUSION AND DISSEMINATION: We will 
      assess the efficacy and safety of physical exercise on semen quality and 
      reproductive outcomes in infertile men. The findings will be published in a 
      peer-reviewed journal to provide evidence-based medical evidence for clinical 
      decision making and the patient's lifestyle guidance. REGISTRATION INFORMATION:

      Review of Clinical Guidelines and Updated Evidence.
PG  - 580-594
LID - 10.4140/TCP.n.2019.580. [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an up-to-date review of current guidelines, previous trials, 
      and new trials regarding aspirin use in primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) 
      disease in the elderly population. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search of articles 
      published through April 2019 was performed using a combination of the following 
      words: aspirin, bleeding, cardiovascular, elderly, hemorrhage, myocardial 
      infarction, primary prevention, stroke. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant 
      randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and guidelines were assessed for the 
      use of aspirin in primary prevention of CV disease in older patients. References 
      from the above literature were also evaluated. Articles were selected for inclusion 
      based on relevance to the topic, detailed methods, and complete results. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: The role of aspirin for primary prevention of CV disease in older adults 
      is not well defined. As a result, the guideline recommendations for the use of 
      aspirin in this setting are inconsistent. In 2018, the ARRIVE, ASCEND, and ASPREE 
      studies were published. These studies tried to address some of the inconsistencies 
      regarding the use of aspirin in primary prevention of CV disease. This article 
      reviews the current recommendations along with previous and recent studies for 
      aspirin use for primary prevention in older adults. CONCLUSION: The role of aspirin 
      for primary prevention of CV disease in older adults should be individualized based 
      on patient's risk factors, including risk of CV disease and likelihood of bleeding. 
      Updated evidence provides more guidance regarding which patient populations will 
      benefit from therapy.

      metastases from cancer of unknown primary: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e6713

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a heterogeneous group of cancers, so 
      called when a biopsy from a patient reveals malignancy without giving a clue to 
      where in the body the primary tumor is located. Whole-body 
      18-fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission-tomography/computed tomography 
      (18F-FDG PET/CT) is widely used for diagnosis and staging of most cancers. We 
      hypothesized that 18F-FDG PET/CT-especially if used early-is suitable for the 
      detection of the primary tumor in patients with CUP. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 
      ability of 18F-FDG PET/CT to detect the primary tumor in adult CUP patients. DATA 
      SOURCES: PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Web of Science. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: 
      Studies on CUP from extracervical metastases in which every patient had received an 
      18F-FDG PET/CT scan and at least one 18F-FDG PET/CT-positive finding was confirmed 
      by biopsy or clinical follow-up. STUDY APPRAISAL: PRISMA and QUADAS-2 were applied. 
      SYNTHESIS METHODS: The pooled detection rate (DR) of 18F-FDG PET/CT was assessed 
      with a fixed-effects model. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the 
      I-squared statistic. RESULTS: A total of 2953 articles were identified from which 
      N = 82 were assessed by full text and N = 20, comprising 1942 adult patients, were 
      included in the study. Median (range) number of patients and DR was N = 72 (21-316) 
      and 36.3% (9.8%-75.3%), respectively. Two-thirds of included studies were 
      retrospective, and the pooled DR was 40.93% (95% confidence interval: 
      38.99%-42.87%). There was large heterogeneity between studies (I-squared = 95.9%), 
      randomization was not applied, CUP diagnosis was not standardized, and workup (if 
      described) was characterized by multiple testing procedures resulting in a highly 
      selected, challenging patient group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite great heterogeneity in 
      diagnostic workup and in studies in general, an overall DR of 40.93% suggests that 
      upfront application of 18F-FDG PET/CT may have a role in CUP by obviating a great 
      many futile diagnostic procedures. To what degree 18F-FDG PET/CT used early in the 
      course of disease may improve the detection rate could not be deducted from selected 
      articles. A large, prospective, preferably randomized, study on the potential 
      benefit of using 18F-FDG PET/CT up front in CUP patients is warranted to judge if 
      and when 18F-FDG PET/CT should be applied in these patients.

TI  - Ventral Hernia Repair: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 647-658
LID - 10.1089/sur.2017.029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: From the patient's perspective, a ventral hernia (VH) can cause pain, 
      adversely affect function, increase size, cosmetically distort the abdomen, and 
      incarcerate/strangulate abdominal contents. The only known "cure" for a VH is 
      surgical repair. The aim of this study was to review systematically the published 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the surgical care of VH. METHOD: A search of 
      the Ovid, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was performed to obtain reports of 
      RCTs on the use of mesh reinforcement in abdominal wall hernia repair. The outcomes 
      assessed were hernia recurrence and surgical site infection (SSI). The overall 
      quality of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
      Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). When feasible, based on assessment of 
      heterogeneity, data were pooled and analyzed in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Of the 
      10,349 titles screened, 25 articles (23 studies) met the search criteria. Evidence 
      indicates that mesh reinforcement in clean cases can decrease hernia recurrence 
      (number needed to treat = 7.9) but increase risk of SSI (number needed to 
      harm = 27.8). Placing mesh in the sublay position (as opposed to the onlay or 
      underlay position) may decrease the risk of hernia recurrence and SSI. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Mesh reinforcement is recommended for all VH repairs in a clean case (high grade of 
      evidence). Sublay mesh location may result in fewer recurrences and SSIs than onlay 
      or inlay placement, but further study is needed to confirm this hypothesis (moderate 
      grade of evidence).

TI  - Selenium for preventing cancer.
PG  - CD005195

LID - CD005195
AB  - BACKGROUND: This review is the third update of the Cochrane review "Selenium for 
      preventing cancer". Selenium is a naturally occurring element with both nutritional 
      and toxicological properties. Higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have 
      been suggested to protect against several types of cancer. OBJECTIVES: To gather and 
      present evidence needed to address two research questions:1. What is the 
      aetiological relationship between selenium exposure and cancer risk in humans?2. 
      Describe the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in humans. 
      SEARCH METHODS: We updated electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid, 2013 to January 2017, 
      week 4), and Embase (2013 to 2017, week 6), as well as searches of clinical trial 
      registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 
      longitudinal observational studies that enrolled adult participants. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: We performed random-effects (RE) meta-analyses when two or more RCTs 
      were available for a specific outcome. We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or 
      more observational studies were available for a specific outcome. We assessed risk 
      of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool 
      and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. We considered in the primary analysis 
      data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence 
      by using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 83 studies in this updated 
      review: two additional RCTs (10 in total) and a few additional trial reports for 
      previously included studies. RCTs involved 27,232 participants allocated to either 
      selenium supplements or placebo. For analyses of RCTs with low risk of bias, the 
      summary risk ratio (RR) for any cancer incidence was 1.01 (95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 0.93 to 1.10; 3 studies, 19,475 participants; high-certainty evidence). The RR 
      for estimated cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.30; 1 study, 17,444 
      participants). For the most frequently investigated site-specific cancers, 
      investigators provided little evidence of any effect of selenium supplementation. 
      Two RCTs with 19,009 participants indicated that colorectal cancer was unaffected by 
      selenium administration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43), as were non-melanoma skin 
      cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.42; 2 studies, 2027 participants), lung cancer (RR 
      1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.50; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), breast cancer (RR 2.04, 
      95% CI 0.44 to 9.55; 1 study, 802 participants), bladder cancer (RR 1.07, 95% CI 
      0.76 to 1.52; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), and prostate cancer (RR 1.01, 95% CI 
      0.90 to 1.14; 4 studies, 18,942 participants). Certainty of the evidence was high 
      for all of these cancer sites, except for breast cancer, which was of moderate 
      certainty owing to imprecision, and non-melanoma skin cancer, which we judged as 
      moderate certainty owing to high heterogeneity. RCTs with low risk of bias suggested 
      increased melanoma risk.Results for most outcomes were similar when we included all 
      RCTs in the meta-analysis, regardless of risk of bias. Selenium supplementation did 
      not reduce overall cancer incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 5 studies, 21,860 
      participants) nor mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 2 studies, 18,698 
      participants). Summary RRs for site-specific cancers showed limited changes compared 
      with estimates from high-quality studies alone, except for liver cancer, for which 
      results were reversed.In the largest trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial, 
      selenium supplementation increased risks of alopecia and dermatitis, and for 
      participants with highest background selenium status, supplementation also increased 
      risk of high-grade prostate cancer. RCTs showed a slightly increased risk of type 2 
      diabetes associated with supplementation. A hypothesis generated by the Nutritional 
      Prevention of Cancer Trial - that individuals with low blood selenium levels could 
      reduce their risk of cancer (particularly prostate cancer) by increasing selenium 
      intake - has not been confirmed. As RCT participants have been overwhelmingly male 
      (88%), we could not assess the potential influence of sex or gender.We included 15 
      additional observational cohort studies (70 in total; over 2,360,000 participants). 
      We found that lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 
      0.93; 7 studies, 76,239 participants) and lower cancer mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 
      0.59 to 0.97; 7 studies, 183,863 participants) were associated with the highest 
      category of selenium exposure compared with the lowest. Cancer incidence was lower 
      in men (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.14, 4 studies, 29,365 men) than in women (OR 0.90, 
      95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, 2 studies, 18,244 women). Data show a decrease in risk of 
      site-specific cancers for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, bladder, and prostate 
      cancers. However, these studies have major weaknesses due to study design, exposure 
      misclassification, and potential unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle or 
      nutritional factors covarying with selenium exposure beyond those taken into account 
      in multi-variable analyses. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relation 
      between selenium status and cancer risk emerged. Certainty of evidence was very low 
      for each outcome. Some studies suggested that genetic factors might modify the 
      relation between selenium and cancer risk - an issue that merits further 
      investigation. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs have 
      shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplements in reducing cancer risk (high 
      certainty of evidence). Some RCTs have raised concerns by reporting a higher 
      incidence of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in participants with 
      selenium supplementation. No clear evidence of an influence of baseline participant 
      selenium status on outcomes has emerged in these studies.Observational longitudinal 
      studies have shown an inverse association between selenium exposure and risk of some 
      cancer types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no 
      systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged. These studies 
      suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure 
      misclassification and unmeasured confounding.Overall, there is no evidence to 
      suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents 
      cancer in humans. However, more research is needed to assess whether selenium may 
      modify the risk of cancer in individuals with a specific genetic background or 
      nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various 
      forms of selenium.

      Meta-Analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetically determined Intellectual Disability (ID) is an intractable 
      condition that involves severe impairment of mental abilities such as learning, 
      reasoning and predicting the future. As of today, little is known about the placebo 
      response in patients with ID. OBJECTIVE: To determine if placebo response exists in 
      patients with genetically determined ID. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: We 
      searched Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO to find all placebo-controlled 
      double-blind randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in patients with genetically 
      determined ID, published up to April 2013, focusing on core ID symptoms. DATA 
      EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators extracted outcome data independently. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Bias-corrected standardized mean difference (Hedge's g) 
      was computed for each outcome measure, using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 
      software. A priori defined patient sub-groups were analyzed using a mixed-effect 
      model. The relationship between pre-defined continuous variable moderators (age, IQ, 
      year of publication and trial duration) and effect size was analyzed using 
      meta-regression. RESULTS: Twenty-two placebo-controlled double-blind RCTs met the 
      inclusion criteria (n = 721, mean age = 17.1 years, 62% men, mean trial duration = 
      35 weeks). There was a significant overall placebo response from pre- to 
      post-treatment in patients with ID (g = 0.468, p = 0.002), both for "subjective 
      outcomes" (a third-person's evaluation of the patient) (g = 0.563, p = 0.022) and 
      "objective outcomes" (direct evaluation of the patient's abilities) (g = 0.434, p = 
      0.036). Individuals with higher IQ had higher response to placebo (p = 0.02) and no 
      placebo response was observed in ID patients with comorbid dementia. A significant 
      effect of age (p = 0.02) was found, indicating higher placebo responses in treatment 
      of younger patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results suggest that patients with 
      genetically determined ID improve in the placebo arm of RCTs. Several mechanisms may 
      contribute to placebo effects in ID, including expectancy, implicit learning and 
      "placebo-by-proxy" induced by clinicians/family members. As the condition is 
      refractory, there is little risk that improvements are explained by spontaneous 
      remission. While new avenues for treatment of genetically determined ID are 
      emerging, our results demonstrate how contextual factors can affect clinical 
      outcomes and emphasize the importance of being vigilant on the role of placebos when 
      testing novel treatments in ID.

TI  - Benzodiazepines versus placebo for panic disorder in adults.
PG  - CD010677
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD010677
AB  - BACKGROUND: Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks 
      consisting of a wave of intense fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes. Panic 
      disorder is a common disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1% to 5% in 
      the general population and a 7% to 10% prevalence in primary care settings. Its 
      aetiology is not fully understood and is probably heterogeneous.Panic disorder is 
      treated with psychological and pharmacological interventions, often used in 
      combination. Although benzodiazepines are frequently used in the treatment of panic 
      disorder, guidelines recommend antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs), as first-line treatment for panic disorder, particularly due to 
      their lower incidence of dependence and withdrawal reaction when compared to 
      benzodiazepines. Despite these recommendations, benzodiazepines are widely used in 
      the treatment of panic disorder, probably because of their rapid onset of action. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of benzodiazepines versus 
      placebo in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. 
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials 
      Register (CCMDCTR Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), and PsycINFO (1967-) 
      up to 29 May 2018. We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and previous 
      systematic reviews. We contacted experts in the field for supplemental data. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All double-blind (blinding of patients and personnel) controlled 
      trials randomising adults with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia to 
      benzodiazepine or placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors 
      independently checked the eligibility of studies and extracted data using a 
      standardised form. Data were then entered data into Review Manager 5 using a 
      double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, 
      participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures in 
      terms of efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability. MAIN RESULTS: We included 24 
      studies in the review with a total of 4233 participants, of which 2124 were 
      randomised to benzodiazepines and 1475 to placebo. The remaining 634 participants 
      were randomised to other active treatments in three-arm trials. We assessed the 
      overall methodological quality of the included studies as poor. We rated all studies 
      as at unclear risk of bias in at least three domains. In addition, we judged 20 of 
      the 24 included studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one domain.Two 
      primary outcomes of efficacy and acceptability showed a possible advantage of 
      benzodiazepines over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for a response to 
      treatment was 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to 1.96) in favour of 
      benzodiazepines, which corresponds to an estimated number needed to treat for an 
      additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 7). The dropout rate was 
      lower among participants treated with benzodiazepines (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 
      0.64); the estimated NNTB was 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). We rated the quality of the 
      evidence as low for both primary outcomes. The possible advantage of benzodiazepine 
      was also seen for remission (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.88) and the endpoint data for 
      social functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% CI -0.65 to 
      -0.42), both with low-quality evidence. We assessed the evidence for the other 
      secondary outcomes as of very low quality. With the exception of the analyses of the 
      change score data for depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.04) and social 
      functioning (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.24), all secondary outcome analyses showed 
      an effect in favour of benzodiazepines compared to placebo. However, the number of 
      dropouts due to adverse effects was higher with benzodiazepines than with placebo 
      (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.15; low-quality evidence). Furthermore, our analyses of 
      adverse events showed that a higher proportion of participants experienced at least 
      one adverse effect when treated with benzodiazepines (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37; 
      low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low-quality evidence shows a possible 
      superiority of benzodiazepine over placebo in the short-term treatment of panic 
      disorders. The validity of the included studies is questionable due to possible 
      unmasking of allocated treatments, high dropout rates, and probable publication 
      bias. Moreover, the included studies were only short-term studies and did not 
      examine the long-term efficacy nor the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Due to these limitations, our results regarding the efficacy of benzodiazepines 
      versus placebo provide only limited guidance for clinical practice. Furthermore, the 
      clinician's choice is not between benzodiazepines and placebo, but between 
      benzodiazepines and other agents, notably SSRIs, both in terms of efficacy and 
      adverse effects. The choice of treatment should therefore be guided by the patient's 
      preference and should balance benefits and harms from treatment in a long-term 
      perspective.

TI  - Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and 
      cardiovascular disease.
PG  - CD010315

LID - CD010315
AB  - BACKGROUND: This is the first update of the review published in 2017. Hypertension 
      is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with 
      hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, 
      so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This 
      strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase 
      adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and 
      established cardiovascular disease remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine if 
      'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in 
      mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 
      160/90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of 
      cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular 
      occlusive disease). SEARCH METHODS: For this updated review, the Cochrane 
      Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized 
      controlled trials up to February 2018: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), 
      Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) 
      (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials 
      Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant 
      papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language 
      restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      that included more than 50 participants per group and provided at least six months' 
      follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total 
      mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular 
      mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic 
      blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (≤ 
      140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg).Participants were adults with documented hypertension and 
      adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for 
      myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or 
      angina pectoris. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently 
      assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures 
      expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included six RCTs that involved a total of 
      9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs 
      provided individual participant data.We found no change in total mortality (risk 
      ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23) or cardiovascular 
      mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we 
      found no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 
      low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial 
      infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart 
      failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; low-quality evidence). Studies reported more 
      participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% 
      CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the 
      lower target group by 8.9/4.5 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target 
      group, but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard 
      target group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of a difference in total 
      mortality, serious adverse events, or total cardiovascular events between people 
      with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower or to a standard 
      blood pressure target. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a 
      lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on adverse 
      events, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to 
      justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and 
      established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to examine this topic.

TI  - Emergency Department-Based Care Transitions for Pediatric Patients: A Systematic 
      Review.
LID - e20160969 [pii]
LID - 10.1542/peds.2016-0969 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Successful care transitions between emergency departments (EDs) and 
      outpatient settings have implications for quality, safety, and cost of care. 
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of ED-based care transition 
      interventions in achieving outpatient follow-up among pediatric patients. DATA 
      SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, trial registers, and reference 
      lists of relevant articles. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Eligible studies 
      included randomized controlled trials of ED-based care transition interventions 
      involving pediatric patients (aged ≤18 years). Study selection, data extraction, and 
      risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate and independent manner. Study 
      results were pooled for meta-analysis by using a random effects model. RESULTS: 
      Sixteen randomized controlled trials, comprising 3760 patients, were included in the 
      study. Most interventions were single-site (n = 14), multicomponent (n = 12), and 
      focused on patients with asthma (n = 8). Pooling data from 10 studies (n = 1965 
      patients) found moderate-quality evidence for a relative increase of 29% in 
      outpatient follow-up with interventions compared with routine care (odds ratio, 1.58 
      [95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.31]). Successful interventions included structured 
      telephone reminders, educational counseling on follow-up, and appointment scheduling 
      assistance. There was low-quality evidence when pooling data from 5 studies (n = 
      1609 participants) that exhibited little or no beneficial effect of interventions on 
      ED readmissions (risk ratio, 1.02 [95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.15]). 
      LIMITATIONS: All studies were conducted in urban US hospitals which makes 
      generalization of the results to rural settings and other countries difficult. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ED-based care transition interventions are effective in increasing 
      follow-up but do not seem to reduce ED readmissions. Further research is required to 
      investigate the mechanisms that affect the success of these interventions.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding a single bolus dose of insulin 
      glulisine to basal insulin ('basal-plus') in persons with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 
      Data from patients with poor glycemic control on oral antihyperglycemic drugs who 
      were initiated on a 'basal-plus' regimen for up to 6 months were pooled from four 
      randomized, multicenter studies. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, 
      postprandial glucose (PPG), insulin dose and demographics were measured at baseline 
      and end of study. RESULTS: 711 patients with a mean age of 59.9 years and a mean 
      duration of diabetes of 11.0 years were included in the analysis population. A 
      'basal-plus' regimen was associated with significant decreases in HbA1c and PPG at 6 
      months, an increase in glargine and glulisine doses and small, but statistically 
      significant, changes in body weight and BMI in all patient subsets. The proportion 
      of patients with HbA1c<7% also increased in all populations studied, while the 
      prevalence of severe hypoglycemia was low and did not significantly differ across 
      patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of 'basal-plus' can 
      achieve a good therapeutic response with a low risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain, 
      regardless of a patient's age or BMI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on 
      obstetric outcomes and birth variables. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis 
      of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): 
      Pregnant women and neonates. INTERVENTION(S): PubMed and 5 other research databases 
      were searched through March 2014 for RCTs evaluating vitamin D supplementation ± 
      calcium/vitamins/ferrous sulfate vs. a control (placebo or active) during pregnancy. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Measures were: circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] 
      levels, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), small for gestational age 
      (SGA), low birth weight, preterm birth, birth weight, birth length, cesarean 
      section. Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects models were used, owing to expected scarcity 
      of outcomes. Effects were reported as relative risks and their 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs). RESULT(S): Thirteen RCTs (n = 2,299) were selected. Circulating 
      25(OH)D levels were significantly higher at term, compared with the control group 
      (mean difference: 66.5 nmol/L, 95% CI 66.2-66.7). Birth weight and birth length were 
      significantly greater for neonates in the vitamin D group; mean difference: 107.6 g 
      (95% CI 59.9-155.3 g) and 0.3 cm (95% CI 0.10-0.41 cm), respectively. Incidence of 
      preeclampsia, GDM, SGA, low birth weight, preterm birth, and cesarean section were 
      not influenced by vitamin D supplementation. Across RCTs, the doses and types of 
      vitamin D supplements, gestational age at first administration, and outcomes were 
      heterogeneous. CONCLUSION(S): Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy was 
      associated with increased circulating 25(OH)D levels, birth weight, and birth 
      length, and was not associated with other maternal and neonatal outcomes. Larger, 
      better-designed RCTs evaluating clinically relevant outcomes are necessary to reach 
      a definitive conclusion.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systemically evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
      laparoscopy versus microsurgery in the surgical therapy of varicocele in male 
      adults. METHODS: Relevant literature, published between January 1995 and October 
      2012, were searched in Pubmed/Medline database, OVID, EMBASE, Chinese Biology 
      Medicine disc (CBMdisc), CNKI, CEBM\CCD, and Cochrane database. The newly published 
      papers were also manually searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) related to 
      the surgical interventions of varicocele were included, and full texts were 
      obtained. Each study was evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Two 
      investigators collected data independently to produce the meta-analysis. RESULTS: 
      Five RCTs met the inclusion criteria and included 554 patients. Data were merged by 
      the RevMan5.1 software. The sperm concentration increased significantly after 
      surgery (WMD = 4.28; 95% CI = 4.16, 6.99; P < .00001, Z = 7.72). There was no 
      significant difference in the postoperative hospital stay between laparoscopy and 
      microsurgery (WMD = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.44, 0.93; P = .49, Z = 0.69). The operation 
      time of laparoscopy was significantly shorter than that of microsurgery 
      (WMD = 40.31, 95% CI = 37.77, 42.86; P < .00001, Z = 31.03). The incidence of 
      hydrocele reduced significantly after microsurgery as compared to laparoscopy 
      (WMD = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.27; P = .0005, Z = 3.49). The postoperative recurrence 
      rate after microsurgery was significantly lower than that after laparoscopy 
      (WMD = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.04, 0.25; P < .00001, Z = 5.01). CONCLUSION: No significant 
      differences were found between microsurgery and laparoscopy for the increase of 
      sperm concentration and operation time. Compared to the laparoscopy group, the 
      microsurgery group had lower postoperative incidence of hydrocele and recurrence 
      rate, but longer in the operation time.

      and meta-analysis.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What is the effect of endometrial scratching in patients with or 
      without prior failed ART cycles on live birth (LBR) and clinical pregnancy rates 
      (CPR)? SUMMARY ANSWER: It remains unclear if endometrial scratching improves the 
      chance of pregnancy and, if so, for whom. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Endometrial 
      scratching is hypothesized to improve embryo implantation in ART. Multiple studies 
      have been published, but it remains unclear if endometrial scratching actually 
      improves pregnancy rates and, if so, for which patients. STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: 
      For this review, a systematic search for published articles on endometrial 
      scratching and ART was performed on 12 February 2018, in Pubmed, Embase and the 
      Cochrane Library. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: Randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) that evaluated endometrial scratching in the cycle prior to the 
      stimulation cycle and reported CPR or LBR were included. RCTs investigating the 
      effect of scratching during the stimulation cycle, or prior to cryo-thaw cycles were 
      excluded. Studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The effect of 
      scratching was assessed for three different patient groups: patients with no prior 
      IVF/ICSI treatment (Group 0), patients with one failed full IVF/ICSI cycle, 
      including cryo-thaw cycles (Group 1) and patients with two or more failed full 
      IVF/ICSI cycles (Group 2). A meta-analysis was performed when statistical 
      heterogeneity was low; otherwise, a descriptive analysis was performed. MAIN RESULTS 
      AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Fourteen RCTs involving 2537 participants were included. 
      Most RCTs contained a high or unclear risk of bias on one or more items. Substantial 
      clinical and statistical heterogeneity was present; therefore meta-analysis for LBR 
      and CPR could only be performed on Group 1. For this group, no differences between 
      scratch and control were found for both LBR (risk ratio (RR) 1.01 [95%CI 0.68-1.51]) 
      and CPR (RR 1.04 [95%CI 0.74-1.45]). For Groups 0 and 2, pooled analysis could not 
      be performed, and for both groups the results of the individual RCTs were negative, 
      neutral and positive. Miscarriage and multiple pregnancy rates were evaluated for 
      the three groups (0, 1 and 2) together. Both outcomes were not significantly 
      different between scratch and control (miscarriage rate RR 0.82 [95%CI 0.57-1.17] 
      and multiple pregnancy rate RR 1.06 [95%CI 0.84-1.35]). Subgroup analysis, excluding 
      trials with a risk of unintentional endometrial injury in the control group, was 
      performed for Group 0 and 2 for LBR and CPR, and for the overall groups for 
      miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate. This reduced the heterogeneity and 
      allowed for pooled analysis in these subgroups. Results of pooled analysis for the 
      subgroups of Group 0 and 2 showed no significant difference for LBR, but CPR was 
      significantly improved after endometrial scratching (Group 0 RR 1.28 [95%CI 
      1.02-1.62] and Group 2 RR 2.03 [95%CI 1.20-3.43]). Subgroup analysis of the overall 
      groups showed no significant difference for miscarriage and multiple pregnancy rate. 
      LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: The main limitations were that many RCTs had a high 
      or unclear risk of bias on one or several items, clinical heterogeneity was still 
      present despite categorizing into three populations, and that not all RCTs could be 
      included in the analyses because separate data for our three groups could not be 
      provided. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: It remains unclear if endometrial 
      scratching improves the chance of pregnancy for women undergoing ART and, if so, for 
      whom. This means endometrial scratching should not be offered in daily practice 
      until results from large and well-designed RCTs and an individual patient data 
      analysis become available. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: No specific funding 
      was sought for the study. The Department of Reproductive Medicine and Gynaecology 
      funds of the University Medical Center of Utrecht were used to support the authors 
      throughout the study period and preparation of the manuscript. None of the authors 
      has a conflict of interest to declare. REGISTRATION NUMBER: Not applicable.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of endometrial scratch injury (ESI) on the outcomes 
      of intrauterine insemination (IUI) stimulated cycles. DESIGN: Systematic review and 
      meta-analysis. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Infertile women undergoing one 
      or more IUI stimulated cycles. INTERVENTION(S): Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      were identified by searching electronic databases. We included RCTs comparing ESI 
      (i.e., intervention group) during the course of IUI stimulated cycle (C-ESI) or 
      during the menstrual cycle preceding IUI treatment (P-ESI) with controls (no 
      endometrial scratch). The summary measures were reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% 
      confidence-interval (CI). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing 
      pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate. 
      RESULT(S): Eight trials were included in the meta-analysis, comprising a total of 
      1,871 IUI cycles. Endometrial scratch injury was associated with a higher clinical 
      pregnancy rate (OR 2.27) and ongoing pregnancy rate (OR 2.04) in comparison with the 
      controls. No higher risk of multiple pregnancy (OR 1.09), miscarriage (OR 0.80), or 
      ectopic pregnancy (OR 0.82) was observed in patients receiving ESI. Subgroup 
      analysis based on ESI timing showed higher clinical pregnancy rate (OR 2.57) and 
      ongoing pregnancy rate (OR 2.27) in patients receiving C-ESI and no advantage in 
      patients receiving P-ESI. CONCLUSION(S): Available data suggest that ESI performed 
      once, preferably during the follicular phase of the same cycle of IUI with flexible 
      aspiration catheters, may improve clinical pregnancy and ongoing pregnancy rates in 
      IUI cycles. Endometrial scratch injury does not appear to increase the risk of 
      multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlled randomized trials (CRTs) comparing the efficacy of patent 
      foramen ovale (PFO) closure and medical therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke 
      have yielded heterogeneous results. No data are available on the net clinical 
      benefit with the two strategies. METHODS: We pooled data of 3440 patients enrolled 
      in five CRTs, randomized to PFO closure (n = 1829) or medical therapy (n = 1611) and 
      followed for a mean of 4.1 years. RESULTS: The net composite endpoint of stroke, 
      major bleeding or atrial fibrillation (AF)/flutter was not different among PFO 
      closure and medical therapy (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.63-1.77; p = 0.83). PFO closure was 
      associated with similar bleeding rates and with a significant 59% relative reduction 
      of recurrent stroke versus medical therapy; in the intervention group this stroke 
      prevention was counterbalanced by a significant 4.7-fold higher risk of AF/flutter. 
      Meta-regression analysis showed that odds ratios for the net composite endpoint were 
      related to prevalence of severe shunt at baseline (p = 0.002), percentage of 
      procedural success (p = 0.002), stroke incidence in the medical therapy arm 
      (p = 0.012) and to follow-up duration (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study-level 
      meta-analysis of CRTs demonstrates that, compared to medical therapy, PFO closure 
      prevents recurrent ischemic cerebral events, but increases the risk of AF/flutter in 
      patients with cryptogenic stroke; as a result, the net clinical benefit with the two 
      strategies was similar. Our results support an individualized therapeutic approach, 
      tailored on the evaluation of the patient's risks (anatomical PFO risk, clinical 
      risk of recurrent stroke, bleeding risk, and risk of AF).

BTI - Mapping the Evidence: Sex Effects in High-Impact Conditions for Women Veterans – 
      Depression, Diabetes, and Chronic Pain
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women are entering the military at unprecedented rates and comprise a 
      rapidly increasing segment of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) enrollees. In 
      response, the VHA Women's Health Service requested an evidence map to (1) identify 
      effective interventions in women, (2) better understand sex differences in 
      intervention effects for high-impact medical conditions, and (3) identify gaps in 
      evidence about the efficacy of interventions in women. METHODS: We used a 
      stakeholder-driven approach to identify high-priority conditions and interventions. 
      From an initial list of 36 conditions, we used a forced-rank methodology to identify 
      3 conditions for evaluation: depressive disorders, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 
      chronic pain conditions (chronic low back pain [CLBP], chronic knee osteoarthritis 
      [OA], and fibromyalgia [FM]). We evaluated treatments in broad categories, including 
      medications, behavioral interventions, supervised exercise, and quality improvement 
      interventions, along with certain condition-specific interventions. For each 
      condition, we searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
      (CDSR) to identify relevant systematic reviews published from January 1, 2009, 
      through October 31, 2014. Data abstracted from eligible systematic reviews included 
      study design, outcomes, the number and design of primary studies, proportion of men 
      and women in included studies, and whether sex effects were part of study aims, 
      analysis plan, or results. For studies containing sex-specific results, we also 
      abstracted the method used for evaluating sex effects (eg, meta-regression) and the 
      outcomes that differed due to sex effects. When information on sex effects was 
      absent from eligible reviews, we selected high-priority interventions for further 
      evaluation. For these interventions, we examined the largest recent systematic 
      review to identify primary randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as candidates for 
      review. We examined RCTs that randomized at least 75 patients per treatment arm to 
      determine whether they reported sex effects. We chose this sample size criterion in 
      order to limit evaluation to RCTs that had the potential for adequate statistical 
      power to detect interaction effects (intervention * sex). RESULTS: A combined search 
      of PubMed and CDSR yielded 2531 unique citations, of which 582 full-text articles 
      were retrieved; 313 systematic reviews were eligible, and 268 were fully abstracted. 
      Of these, 86 addressed interventions for depression, 114 addressed interventions for 
      diabetes, and 68 addressed interventions for 3 types of chronic pain: CLBP (n=26), 
      FM (n=34), and knee OA (n=8). Most reviews limited eligibility to RCTs, and the 
      number of primary studies included in the systematic reviews ranged from 0 to 347. 
      Only half (48%) of the reviews summarized the gender distribution of the populations 
      of the included studies, but when summarized, women were well represented. Sex 
      effects were reported in only 30 of the 313 (10%) eligible reviews: 14 (16%) for 
      depressive disorders, 13 (8%) for diabetes, and 3 (4%) for chronic pain. Individual 
      patient data (IPD) meta-analysis—the analysis method best suited to evaluating sex 
      effects—was rarely used (n=16 of 268 abstracted reviews, 6%). Overall, we found only 
      a minority of RCTs had sample sizes large enough to examine moderator effects, and 
      only 14% of these (9 of 66) examined interactions between sex and the main 
      comparison, intervention type versus control group. When sex effects analyses were 
      identified, most commonly no effect was found. Those with evidence of a sex effect 
      often showed greater benefit in women (Table), but differential effects were 
      typically small. There were important gaps in evidence on sex effects for multiple 
      interventions in all conditions examined, either because no reviews evaluating sex 
      effects were identified or because no IPD meta-analyses were identified. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There is a large body of evidence for many of the examined 
      interventions, particularly medications, psychotherapy, and exercise. However, 
      systematic reviews and primary RCTs examined sex effects infrequently. When 
      examined, sex effects generally favored greater benefits in women, but the 
      differential effects were small and the analysis approaches were often suboptimal. 
      All RCTs and systematic reviews should report the proportion of men and women 
      enrolled, and sex effects should be examined in adequately powered RCTs or IPD 
      meta-analyses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective 
      glucose-lowering drugs. Findings from cardiovascular outcome trials showed 
      cardiovascular safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists, but results for cardiovascular 
      efficacy were varied. We aimed to examine overall cardiovascular efficacy for 
      lixisenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, and extended-release exenatide. METHODS: In 
      this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analysed data from eligible trials that 
      assessed the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared with placebo in 
      adult patients (aged 18 years or older) with type 2 diabetes and had a primary 
      outcome including, but not limited to, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal 
      myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. We searched PubMed and MEDLINE without 
      language restrictions up to Sept 18, 2017, for eligible trials. We did a 
      meta-analysis of available trial data using a random-effects model to calculate 
      overall hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular efficacy outcomes and odds ratios for 
      key safety outcomes. FINDINGS: Of 12 articles identified in our search and screened 
      for eligibility, four trials of cardiovascular outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonists 
      were identified: ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), SUSTAIN 6 
      (semaglutide), and EXSCEL (extended-release exenatide). Compared with placebo, GLP-1 
      receptor agonist treatment showed a significant 10% relative risk reduction in the 
      three-point major adverse cardiovascular event primary outcome (cardiovascular 
      mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke; HR 0·90, 95% CI 
      0·82-0·99; p=0·033), a 13% RRR in cardiovascular mortality (0·87, 0·79-0·96; 
      p=0·007), and a 12% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality (0·88, 0·81-0·95; 
      p=0·002), with low-to-moderate between-trial statistical heterogeneity. No 
      significant effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists was identified on fatal and non-fatal 
      myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, hospital admission for unstable 
      angina, or hospital admission for heart failure. Overall, no significant differences 
      were seen in severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or medullary 
      thyroid cancer reported between GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment and placebo. 
      INTERPRETATION: Our findings show cardiovascular safety across all GLP-1 receptor 
      agonist cardiovascular outcome trials and suggest that drugs in this class can 
      reduce three-point major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, 
      and all-cause mortality risk, albeit to varying degrees for individual drugs, 
      without significant safety concerns. GLP-1 receptor agonists have a favourable 
      risk-benefit balance overall, which should allow the choice of drug to be 
      individualised to each patient's needs. FUNDING: Amylin Pharmaceuticals

TI  - Automated versus non-automated weaning for reducing the duration of mechanical 
      ventilation for critically ill adults and children: a cochrane systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Automated weaning systems may improve adaptation of mechanical support 
      for a patient's ventilatory needs and facilitate systematic and early recognition of 
      their ability to breathe spontaneously and the potential for discontinuation of 
      ventilation. Our objective was to compare mechanical ventilator weaning duration for 
      critically ill adults and children when managed with automated systems versus 
      non-automated strategies. Secondary objectives were to determine differences in 
      duration of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay 
      (LOS), mortality, and adverse events. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to 
      30 September 2013 without language restrictions. We also searched conference 
      proceedings; trial registration websites; and article reference lists. Two authors 
      independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined data using 
      random-effects modelling. RESULTS: We identified 21 eligible trials totalling 1,676 
      participants. Pooled data from 16 trials indicated that automated systems reduced 
      the geometric mean weaning duration by 30% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13% to 
      45%), with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 87%, P <0.00001). Reduced weaning 
      duration was found with mixed or medical ICU populations (42%, 95% CI 10% to 63%) 
      and Smartcare/PS (28%, 95% CI 7% to 49%) but not with surgical populations or using 
      other systems. Automated systems reduced ventilation duration with no heterogeneity 
      (10%, 95% CI 3% to 16%) and ICU LOS (8%, 95% CI 0% to 15%). There was no strong 
      evidence of effect on mortality, hospital LOS, reintubation, self-extubation and 
      non-invasive ventilation following extubation. Automated systems reduced prolonged 
      mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Overall quality of evidence was high. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Automated systems may reduce weaning and ventilation duration and ICU 
      stay. Due to substantial trial heterogeneity an adequately powered, high quality, 
      multi-centre randomized controlled trial is needed.

AB  - CONTEXT: The quality of death has increasingly raised concern because of the 
      physical and psychological suffering of patients with advanced disease. Music 
      therapy has been widely used in palliative care; however, its physical and mental 
      effectiveness remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of music 
      therapy during palliative care in improving physiology and psychology outcomes. 
      METHODS: Randomized controlled trials evaluating music therapy for terminally ill 
      patients were searched and included from inception up to April 25, 2018. The quality 
      of the studies was assessed using the risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane 
      Handbook V.5.1.0. RESULTS: In this study, 11 randomized controlled trials 
      (inter-rater agreement, κ = 0.86) involving 969 participants were included. The 
      quality of the included studies ranged from moderate to high. Compared with general 
      palliative care, music therapy can reduce pain (standardized mean difference: -0.44, 
      95% confidence interval: -0.60 to -0.27, P < 0.00001) and improve the quality of 
      life (standardized mean difference: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.41 to 0.82, 
      P < 0.00001) in terminally ill patients. In addition, anxiety, depression, and 
      emotional function are improved as well. However, no significant differences were 
      found in the patient's physical status, fatigue, and social function. CONCLUSION: 
      This meta-analysis study demonstrated that music therapy served as an effective 
      intervention to alleviate pain and psychological symptoms of terminally ill 
      patients. However, considering the limitation of the quantity of the studies 
      included, these results would need to be further confirmed.

AB  - AIM: Oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction are two inter-related conditions 
      commonly seen in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. The enzyme, xanthine 
      oxidase, is an important contributor to these phenomena but to a variable degree in 
      different patient populations. This meta-analysis will summarize the effect of 
      allopurinol, an established xanthine oxidase inhibitor, on endothelial function 
      among patients with different comorbidities. METHODS: Medline Complete, PubMed, 
      ProQuest, ClinicalKey, Wiley Online Library, and Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials were searched till July 29, 2017. Meta-analysis was planned for 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated allopurinol effects on 
      endothelial function. A random effect model was used to calculate the standardized 
      mean difference (with 95% confidence intervals: CI) as an estimate of effect size. 
      Heterogeneity was quantified by four types of information: Q statistics, I(2) 
      statistic, Tau-squared (T(2) ), and Tau (T). RESULTS: Thirty eligible studies were 
      identified; 12 were included in the final analysis and subdivided among 3 patient's 
      groups: patients with chronic heart failure (CHF; 197 patients), patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD; 183 patients), and patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (DM; 170 patients). Allopurinol was found to have a statistically 
      significant benefit on endothelial function in patients with CHF and CKD but not in 
      type 2 DM. The standardized mean differences and CI in the three patient's groups 
      were 0.776 (0.429, 1.122), 0.350 (0.009, 0.690), and 1.331 (-0.781, 3.444), 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Allopurinol has an antioxidant property that might 
      partially reverse endothelial dysfunction in patients with certain comorbidities. 
      The importance of this property and the magnitude of the beneficial effect are 
      likely to be related to the relative contribution of xanthine oxidase into the 
      oxidative stress associated with different underlying pathologies.

TI  - The impact of intensive care unit diaries on patients' and relatives' outcomes: a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Memory gaps in intensive care unit (ICU) survivors are associated with 
      psychiatric disorders. The ICU diaries improve the patient's factual memory of the 
      ICU, but it is not clear if they reduce the incidence of psychiatric disorders in 
      patients and relatives after hospital discharge. The aim of this study is to 
      evaluate the literature on the effect of ICU diaries for patients admitted in ICU 
      and their relatives. METHODS: Two authors independently searched the online 
      databases PubMed, OVID, Embase, EBSCO host, and PsycINFO from inception to July 
      2019. Studies were included if the intervention group (ICU diary) was compared with 
      a group with no diaries and the sample was comprised patients ≥ 18 years old 
      admitted in the ICU for more than 24 h and their relatives. Randomized clinical 
      trials, observational studies, letter with original data, and abstracts were 
      included, irrespective of the language. The search was not limited by any specific 
      outcome. Review articles, commentaries, editorials, and studies without a control 
      group were excluded. Structured tools were used to assess the methodological quality 
      ("Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I)" for cohort 
      studies and the "Cochrane Risk of Bias tool" for included RCTs and before/after 
      studies). A random-effects model was employed considering the anticipated 
      variability between the studies. RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-five titles were 
      identified for screening. Two additional studies were selected after a reference 
      search, and after a full-text review, a total of 12 studies were included. When 
      pooling the results, ICU diary was associated with lower risk of depression (RR 
      0.41, 95% CI 0.23-0.75) and better quality of life (10.3 points higher in SF-36 
      general health score, 95% CI 0.79-19.8), without a decrease in anxiety or 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For the relatives receiving an ICU diary, 
      there was no difference in the incidence of PTSD, anxiety, or depression. CONCLUSION 
      AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis supports the use of ICU 
      diaries to reduce the risk of depression and preserve the quality of life of 
      patients after ICU admission. ICU diaries do not seem to have any beneficial effect 
      on the relatives of the patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO, CRD42019136639.

AB  - Objective Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) has two anatomical targets: the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus 
      pallidus internus (GPI). The clinical effectiveness of these two stimulation targets 
      was compared in the present study. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was 
      performed to evaluated the postoperative changes in the United Parkinson's Disease 
      Rating Scale (UPDRS) on- and off-phase, on-stimulation motor scores; activities of 
      daily living score (ADLS); and levodopa equivalent dose (LED) after STN and GPI 
      stimulation. Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials of PD treated by STN and 
      GPI stimulation were considered for inclusion. Results Eight published reports of 
      eligible studies involving 599 patients met the inclusion criteria. No significant 
      differences were observed between the STN and GPI groups in the on-medication, 
      on-stimulation UPDRS motor score [mean difference, 2.15; 95% confidence interval 
      (CI), -0.96-5.27] or ADLS (mean difference, 3.40; 95% CI, 0.95-7.76). Significant 
      differences in favor of STN stimulation were noted in the off-medication, 
      on-stimulation UPDRS motor score (mean difference, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.98-2.37) and LED 
      (mean difference, 130.24; 95% CI, 28.82-231.65). Conclusion The STN may be the 
      preferred target for DBS in consideration of medication reduction, economic 
      efficiency, and motor function improvement in the off phase. However, treatment 
      decisions should be made according to the individual patient's symptoms and 
      expectations.

PG  - e0139817

LID - e0139817
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduced calorie, low fat diet is currently recommended diet for 
      overweight and obese adults. Prior data suggest that low carbohydrate diets may also 
      be a viable option for those who are overweight and obese. PURPOSE: Compare the 
      effects of low carbohydrate versus low fats diet on weight and atherosclerotic 
      cardiovascular disease risk in overweight and obese patients. DATA SOURCES: 
      Systematic literature review via PubMed (1966-2014). STUDY SELECTION: Randomized 
      controlled trials with ≥8 weeks follow up, comparing low carbohydrate (≤120gm 
      carbohydrates/day) and low fat diet (≤30% energy from fat/day). DATA EXTRACTION: 
      Data were extracted and prepared for analysis using double data entry. Prior to 
      identification of candidate publications, the outcomes of change in weight and 
      metabolic factors were selected as defined by Cochrane Collaboration. Assessment of 
      the effects of diets on predicted risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
      risk was added during the data collection phase. DATA SYNTHESIS: 1797 patients were 
      included from 17 trials with <1 year follow up in 12. Compared with low fat diet, 
      low carbohydrate was associated with significantly greater reduction in weight (Δ = 
      -2.0 kg, 95% CI: -3.1, -0.9) and significantly lower predicted risk of 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (p<0.03). Frequentist and Bayesian 
      results were concordant. The probability of greater weight loss associated with low 
      carbohydrate was >99% while the reduction in predicted risk favoring low 
      carbohydrate was >98%. LIMITATIONS: Lack of patient-level data and heterogeneity in 
      dropout rates and outcomes reported. CONCLUSIONS: This trial-level meta-analysis of 
      randomized controlled trials comparing LoCHO diets with LoFAT diets in strictly 
      adherent populations demonstrates that each diet was associated with significant 
      weight loss and reduction in predicted risk of ASCVD events. However, LoCHO diet was 
      associated with modest but significantly greater improvements in weight loss and 
      predicted ASCVD risk in studies from 8 weeks to 24 months in duration. These results 
      suggest that future evaluations of dietary guidelines should consider low 
      carbohydrate diets as effective and safe intervention for weight management in the 
      overweight and obese, although long-term effects require further investigation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analyses examining 
      the impact of pharmacist interventions as part of health care teams on diabetes 
      therapeutic outcomes in ambulatory care settings. DATA SOURCES: PubMed/MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, Cochrane Library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Web of Science, 
      Scopus, WHO's Global Health Library, ClinicalTrials.gov , and Google Scholar were 
      searched (1995 to February 2017). Search terms included pharmacist, team, and 
      diabetes. STUDY SELECTION: Full-text articles published in English with comparative 
      designs, including randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, 
      and pretest-posttest studies evaluating hemoglobin A(1C) (A1C), were assessed. DATA 
      EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently screened for study inclusion 
      and extracted data. Quality of the studies was assessed using tools developed based 
      on the framework of the Cochrane Collaboration's recommendations. DATA SYNTHESIS: A 
      total of 1908 studies were identified from the literature and reference searches; 42 
      studies were included in the systematic review (n = 10 860) and 35 in the 
      meta-analyses (n = 7417). Mean age ranged from 42 to 73 years, and 8% to 100% were 
      male. The overall standardized mean difference (SMD) for A1C for pharmacist care 
      versus comparison was 0.57 ( P < 0.01), a moderate effect representing a mean 
      difference of 1.1% (95% CI = 0.88-1.27). The effects for systolic blood pressure and 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were between small and moderate (SMD = 0.31 and 
      0.32; P < 0.01). The heterogeneity was high for all outcomes (>83%), indicating 
      functional differences among the studies. No publication bias was detected. 
      CONCLUSION: Pharmacists' interventions as part of the patient's health care team 
      improved diabetes therapeutic outcomes, substantiating the important role of 
      pharmacists in team-based diabetes management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the using oil-soluble contrast material (OSCM) 
      vs. water-soluble contrast material (WSCM) for hysterosalpingography on pregnancy 
      rates in infertile women. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: Not 
      applicable. PATIENT(S): Infertile women. INTERVENTION(S): We included randomized 
      controlled trials comparing pregnancy outcomes in women with infertility undergoing 
      hysterosalpingography using OSCM and WSCM. Paired reviewers independently screened 
      citations, assessed risk of bias of included studies, and extracted data. A 
      random-effects model was used to report all outcomes. The Grading of Recommendations 
      Assessment, Development, Evaluation（GRADE） system was used to quantify absolute 
      effects and quality of evidence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary outcome was 
      ongoing pregnancy per randomized women. RESULT(S): Six trials with a total of 2,562 
      patients were selected. Our meta-analysis showed OSCM was associated with 
      significantly higher rates of ongoing pregnancy compared with WSCM (odds ratio [OR] 
      1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.93; I(2) = 44%, moderate-quality 
      evidence). Three trials reported live birth, but they were not pooled owing to 
      extreme statistical heterogeneity (I(2) = 86%). There was no difference in incidence 
      of miscarriage (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.56-1.24) or ectopic pregnancy (OR 0.65, 95% CI 
      0.18-2.36) between OSCM and WSCM groups. Three trials were rated as low risk of 
      bias, whereas three were considered unclear. CONCLUSION(S): Women who previously 
      underwent hysterosalpingography using oil contrast had higher rates of ongoing 
      pregnancy compared with women who underwent this procedure using water contrast. 
      There is not enough evidence to either support or oppose the difference between 
      groups concerning miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.

      treatment of fetal growth restriction.

AB  - Fetal growth restriction and related placental pathologies such as preeclampsia, 
      stillbirth, and placental abruption are believed to arise in early pregnancy when 
      inadequate remodeling of the maternal spiral arteries leads to persistent 
      high-resistance and low-flow uteroplacental circulation. The consequent placental 
      ischaemia, reperfusion injury, and oxidative stress are associated with an imbalance 
      in angiogenic/antiangiogenic factors. Many interventions have centered on the 
      prevention and/or treatment of preeclampsia with results pertaining to fetal growth 
      restriction and small-for-gestational-age pregnancy often included as secondary 
      outcomes because of the common pathophysiology. This renders the study findings less 
      reliable for determining clinical significance. For the prevention of fetal growth 
      restriction, a recent large-study level meta-analysis and individual patient data 
      meta-analysis confirm that aspirin modestly reduces small-for-gestational-age 
      pregnancy in women at high risk (relative risk, 0.90, 95% confidence interval, 
      0.81-1.00) and that a dose of ≥100 mg should be recommended and to start at or 
      before 16 weeks of gestation. These findings support national clinical practice 
      guidelines. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that low-molecular-weight heparin 
      may prevent fetal growth restriction; however, evidence from randomized control 
      trials is inconsistent. A meta-analysis of multicenter trial data does not 
      demonstrate any positive preventative effect of low-molecular-weight heparin on a 
      primary composite outcome of placenta-mediated complications including fetal growth 
      restriction (18% vs 18%; absolute risk difference, 0.6%; 95% confidence interval, 
      10.4-9.2); use of low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of fetal growth 
      restriction should remain in the research setting. There are even fewer treatment 
      options once fetal growth restriction is diagnosed. At present the only management 
      option if the risk of hypoxia, acidosis, and intrauterine death is high is 
      iatrogenic preterm birth, with the use of peripartum maternal administration of 
      magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection and corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity, 
      to prevent adverse neonatal outcomes. The pipeline of potential therapies use 
      different strategies, many aiming to increase fetal growth by improving poor 
      placentation and uterine blood flow. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors that 
      potentiate nitric oxide availability such as sildenafil citrate have been 
      extensively researched both in preclinical and clinical studies; results from the 
      Sildenafil Therapy In Dismal Prognosis Early-Onset Intrauterine Growth Restriction 
      consortium of randomized control clinical trials are keenly awaited. Targeting the 
      uteroplacental circulation with novel therapeutics is another approach, the most 
      advanced being maternal vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy, which is 
      being translated into the clinic via the doEs Vascular endothelial growth factor 
      gene therapy safEly impRove outcome in seveRe Early-onset fetal growth reSTriction 
      consortium. Other targeting approaches include nanoparticles and microRNAs to 
      deliver drugs locally to the uterine arterial endothelium or trophoblast. In vitro 
      and in vivo studies and animal models have demonstrated effects of nitric oxide 
      donors, dietary nitrate, hydrogen sulphide donors, statins, and proton pump 
      inhibitors on maternal blood pressure, uteroplacental resistance indices, and 
      angiogenic/antiangiogenic factors. Data from human pregnancies and, in particular, 
      pregnancies with fetal growth restriction remain very limited. Early research into 
      melatonin, creatine, and N-acetyl cysteine supplementation in pregnancy suggests 
      they may have potential as neuro- and cardioprotective agents in fetal growth 
      restriction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether hysteroscopic sterilization is feasible and effective 
      in preventing pregnancy. Secondarily, to identify risk factors for failure of 
      hysteroscopic sterilization. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: 
      Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Women undergoing hysteroscopic sterilization. 
      INTERVENTION(S): Hysteroscopic sterilization with a commercially available system 
      (Ovabloc Intra Tubal Device, Essure system, or Adiana permanent contraception 
      system). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Successful placement at first attempt, confirmed 
      correct placement, complications, incidence of pregnancy, and risk factors for 
      placement failure in hysteroscopic sterilization. RESULT(S): Of the 429 citations 
      identified, 45 articles were eligible for analyses. No randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) were identified, just cohort studies. Six articles concerned Ovabloc, 37 
      Essure, and two Adiana sterilization. The probabilities for successful bilateral 
      placement in a first attempt for Ovabloc, Essure, and Adiana, were, respectively, in 
      the ranges 78%-84%, 81%-98%, and 94%. The probabilities of successful bilateral 
      placement could not be pooled because of substantial heterogeneity. The 36 months' 
      cumulative pregnancy rate of Adiana was 16 of 1,000. Reliable pregnancy rates after 
      sterilization with Ovabloc or Essure method could not be calculated. For all three 
      hysteroscopic techniques, the incidence of complications and their severity has not 
      been studied adequately and remains unclear. We also found too little evidence to 
      identify risk factors for placement failure. CONCLUSION(S): Sterilization by 
      hysteroscopy seems feasible, but the effectiveness and risk factors for failure of 
      sterilization remain unclear owing to the poor-quality evidence. Both currently 
      applied hysteroscopic sterilization techniques and the coming new techniques must be 
      evaluated properly for feasibility and effectiveness. Appropriate RCTs and 
      observational studies with sufficient power and complete and long-term (>10 years) 
      follow-up data on unintended pregnancies and complications are needed.

      expressed as proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULT(S): Pulsatile 
      GnRH treatment appears to achieve high OvRs. A trend toward high PORs and LBORs 
      among women with HA is demonstrated. SC pGnRH achieves comparable OvR compared with 
      IV pGnRH. The incidence of OHSS is low and of mild severity. Treatment with pGnRH is 
      associated with low but slightly higher MG rates compared with the general 
      population. IV administered pGnRH is rarely associated with ST. CONCLUSION(S): The 
      high OvRs leading to a high rate of singleton pregnancies and the low likelihood of 
      OHSS render the pGnRH treatment modality both effective and safe for the treatment 
      of women with HA of either primary or secondary origin.

TI  - Vitamin D for the management of asthma.
PG  - CD011511
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD011511.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD011511
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several clinical trials of vitamin D to prevent asthma exacerbation and 
      improve asthma control have been conducted in children and adults, but a 
      meta-analysis restricted to double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of 
      this intervention is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of administration 
      of vitamin D and its hydroxylated metabolites in reducing the risk of severe asthma 
      exacerbations (defined as those requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids) 
      and improving asthma symptom control. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane 
      Airways Group Trial Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted the 
      authors of studies in order to identify additional trials. Date of last search: 
      January 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 
      trials of vitamin D in children and adults with asthma evaluating exacerbation risk 
      or asthma symptom control or both. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors 
      independently applied study inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed 
      risk of bias. We obtained missing data from the authors where possible. We reported 
      results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We included seven trials 
      involving a total of 435 children and two trials involving a total of 658 adults in 
      the primary analysis. Of these, one trial involving 22 children and two trials 
      involving 658 adults contributed to the analysis of the rate of exacerbations 
      requiring systemic corticosteroids. Duration of trials ranged from four to 12 
      months, and the majority of participants had mild to moderate asthma. Administration 
      of vitamin D reduced the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids 
      (rate ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88; 680 participants; 3 studies; high-quality 
      evidence), and decreased the risk of having at least one exacerbation requiring an 
      emergency department visit or hospitalisation or both (odds ratio (OR) 0.39, 95% CI 
      0.19 to 0.78; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome, 27; 963 
      participants; 7 studies; high-quality evidence). There was no effect of vitamin D on 
      % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (mean difference (MD) 0.48, 95% 
      CI -0.93 to 1.89; 387 participants; 4 studies; high-quality evidence) or Asthma 
      Control Test scores (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.54; 713 participants; 3 studies; 
      high-quality evidence). Administration of vitamin D did not influence the risk of 
      serious adverse events (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.89; 879 participants; 5 studies; 
      moderate-quality evidence). One trial comparing low-dose versus high-dose vitamin D 
      reported two episodes of hypercalciuria, one in each study arm. No other study 
      reported any adverse event potentially attributable to administration of vitamin D. 
      No participant in any included trial suffered a fatal asthma exacerbation. We did 
      not perform a subgroup analysis to determine whether the effect of vitamin D on risk 
      of severe exacerbation was modified by baseline vitamin D status, due to 
      unavailability of suitably disaggregated data. We assessed two trials as being at 
      high risk of bias in at least one domain; neither trial contributed data to the 
      analysis of the outcomes reported above. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of a 
      modest number of trials in people with predominantly mild to moderate asthma 
      suggests that vitamin D is likely to reduce both the risk of severe asthma 
      exacerbation and healthcare use. It is as yet unclear whether these effects are 
      confined to people with lower baseline vitamin D status; further research, including 
      individual patient data meta-analysis of existing datasets, is needed to clarify 
      this issue. Children and people with frequent severe asthma exacerbations were 
      under-represented; additional primary trials are needed to establish whether vitamin 
      D can reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbation in these groups.

COIS- ARM, MU, MJ, and CJG all acted as investigators in one or more clinical trials 
      contributing data to this review. The 'Risk of bias' assessment for the study 
      authored by ARM and CJG was performed independently by UN and CJC (Martineau 2015). 
      For all other studies, ARM and one of CJC and APG independently assessed the risk of 
      bias for each study. Where data from primary studies conducted by review authors 
      contributed to a given outcome, the quality of the evidence was assessed by review 
      authors who were not involved with those primary studies (CJC and AS).

TI  - Additional appointments and discomfort associated with compliance-free fixed Class 
      II corrector treatment: a systematic review.
PG  - 404-414
LID - 10.1093/ejo/cjy074 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A critical analysis of the literature to determine the prevalence and 
      type of emergency/additional appointments, and discomfort levels associated with 
      fixed Class II correctors. METHODS: Studies examining patient's sources of 
      discomfort or emergency appointments associated with compliance-free Class II 
      correctors were included. Comprehensive searches up to July 2018 were conducted 
      using the following databases: MEDLINE (OvidSP), PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. 
      A partial grey literature search was taken using Google Scholar and OpenGrey. Two 
      reviewers independently performed the selection process and risk of bias assessment. 
      The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cross-sectional studies were used. A summary of the 
      overall strength of evidence was presented using 'Grading of Recommendations, 
      Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) tool. Included studies were 
      evaluated according to their design, study quality, consistency, and directness. 
      RESULTS: The selected studies were published between 2001 and 2018, and the number 
      of patients per studied group ranged from 8 to 182. One thousand five hundred 
      forty-two patients were evaluated in total. The patients' mean age at start of 
      treatment ranged from 10 to 16.9 years and the fixed Class II corrector treatment 
      duration ranged from 4 to 12 months. The included studies in this systematic review 
      were too clinically heterogeneous (different appliances, different data recollection 
      processes) to justify a meta-analysis. LIMITATIONS: This review was not previously 
      registered. A low level of evidence was observed among the two randomized trials, 
      the 10 cohorts and three cross-sectional studies identified. CONCLUSIONS: The main 
      source of discomfort from Forsus-type appliances appears to be soreness in the 
      cheeks (low level of evidence with a weak recommendation strength). Most evaluated 
      patients treated with a Herbst appliance, regardless of design, will experience 
      complications (fractures and/or dislodging) requiring emergency appointments (low 
      level of evidence with a weak recommendation strength). REGISTRATION: The review 
      protocol was not registered.

BTI - Aspirin for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events: A Systematic Evidence 
      Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United 
      States, contributing to more than a third of deaths annually. PURPOSE: To 
      systematically review evidence for the effectiveness of aspirin to prevent 
      myocardial infarction (MI)/coronary events, stroke, cardiovascular death, and 
      all-cause mortality in those without a history of CVD. To review evidence for harms 
      associated with aspirin use. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, and the 
      Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials to identify literature that was 
      published between January 2008 and June 2014. We supplemented our searches with 
      reference lists from the previous review, relevant existing systematic reviews, 
      suggestions from experts, and Clinicaltrials.gov to identify ongoing trials. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Two investigators independently reviewed identified abstracts and 
      full-text articles against a set of a priori inclusion and quality criteria. DATA 
      ANALYSIS: One investigator abstracted data into an evidence table and a second 
      investigator checked these data. We conducted Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects 
      meta-analyses to estimate the effect size of aspirin chemoprevention in preventing 
      MI/coronary events, stroke, CVD-related death and all-cause mortality. Additionally, 
      we conducted sensitivity analyses using Peto odds ratios. We qualitatively 
      synthesized the harms related to major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, hemorrhagic 
      stroke, and age-related macular degeneration to estimate the harms associated with 
      aspirin use. RESULTS: We included 10 fair- to good-quality randomized, controlled 
      trials (RCTs) (N=103,787) examining the effectiveness of aspirin for the primary 
      prevention of CVD. Aspirin reduces the risk of major CVD events (total MI, total 
      stroke, CVD mortality) by 11 percent (relative risk [RR], 0.89 [95% confidence 
      interval (CI), 0.84 to 0.95]), which appears to be largely driven by a 20 percent 
      reduction in nonfatal MI/coronary events (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.72 to 0.88]). 
      Aspirin’s effectiveness in reducing nonfatal MI/coronary events that were reported 
      in trials of doses ranging from 100 mg every other day to 650 mg daily were also 
      seen with trials using 100 mg or less daily. While primary prevention trials for 
      doses 100 mg every other day to 650 mg daily demonstrated no reduction in stroke 
      events with aspirin use, trials using 100 mg daily or less showed a reduction in 
      total stroke (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.96]). CVD mortality was unchanged with the 
      use of aspirin in these 10 trials. All-cause mortality may be unchanged or slightly 
      reduced with a statistically significant benefit not persistent in dose sensitivity 
      analyses. All trials were powered for CVD composite outcomes. Increasing age being 
      associated with greater RR reductions was the only consistent subgroup trend we 
      identified. Trials of patients with diabetes showed no CVD benefit and trials with 
      diabetes subgroup analyses showed no effect modification in this group. Given the 
      paucity of data, we can draw no conclusions about treatment benefit modification 
      based on aspirin formulation or duration. Aspirin’s CVD benefit appears to begin 
      within the first 5 years of administration; there are limited data for longer 
      durations. We included nine of these RCTs to examine the major GI bleeding harms, 
      hemorrhagic stroke, and other harms associated with aspirin use. Major GI bleeding 
      was reported variably in the nine trials, with RRs ranging from 0.50 to 8.10. An 
      individual participant data meta-analysis reported a 50 percent increase in major GI 
      bleeding and other extracranial bleeding (RR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.30 to 1.82]) with 
      aspirin use compared to controls. Seven trials reported hemorrhagic stroke as rare 
      events (≤5% incidence) in both aspirin and control groups, making the numbers too 
      unstable to precisely estimate the effect of aspirin on this harm. Two RCTs found no 
      statistically significant difference in age-related macular degeneration in the 
      aspirin group compared to controls. Both trials showed RRs of less than 1. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In primary prevention populations, aspirin modestly reduces nonfatal 
      MI/coronary events and major CVD events, but also increases major GI bleeding risk. 
      More precise real-world estimates for bleeding events, including major GI bleeding 
      events and hemorrhagic stroke, are necessary to calculate the net benefit. At some 
      absolute risk for 10-year CVD events, this absolute CVD benefit could potentially 
      outweigh the bleeding risks. Models to identify these populations are needed.

AB  - Endometriomas are common in reproductive-aged women, but controversy exists 
      regarding their management. PubMed was searched to identify pertinent studies on 
      outcomes of medical and surgical management of endometrioma, with focus on 
      randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. Surgical excision is more effective 
      than fenestration/coagulation of endometrioma for pelvic pain but decreases 
      antimullerian hormone. It may modestly improve the chances of spontaneous pregnancy, 
      but does not impact chances of success with in vitro fertilization. Oral 
      contraceptive pills improve dysmenorrhea but not dyspareunia or noncyclic pelvic 
      pain. Management of the patient with endometrioma should be individualized based on 
      each patient's particular symptoms and short-term and long-term fertility goals.

AB  - Probiotics are increasingly used for prevention and treatment of diarrhea more in 
      children than in adults. Given the broad spectrum of diarrhea, this review focuses 
      on the main etiologies: acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), 
      and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). For each, we reviewed randomized controlled 
      trials, meta-analyses, and guidelines. For acute gastroenteritis we found 12 
      guidelines: 5 recommended probiotics and 7 did not. However, the guidelines 
      containing positive recommendations provided proof of evidence from clinical trials 
      and meta-analyses. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Saccharomyces boulardii had 
      the most compelling evidence of efficacy as they reduced the duration of the disease 
      by 1 day. For AAD 4 meta-analyses were found, reporting variable efficacy of 
      probiotics in preventing diarrhea, based on the setting, patient's age, and 
      antibiotics. The most effective strains were LGG and S. boulardii. For NEC, we found 
      3 randomized controlled trials, 5 meta-analyses, and 4 position papers. Probiotics 
      reduced the risk of NEC enterocolitis and mortality in preterm babies. Guidelines 
      did not support a routine use of probiotics and asked for further data for such 
      sensitive implications. In conclusion, there is strong and solid proof of efficacy 
      of probiotics as active treatment of gastroenteritis in addition to rehydration. 
      There is solid evidence that probiotics have some efficacy in prevention of AAD, but 
      the number needed to treat is an issue. For both etiologies LGG and S. boulardii 
      have the strongest evidence. In NEC the indications are more debated, yet on the 
      basis of available data and their implications, probiotics should be carefully 
      considered.

TI  - Intravenous Iron for Treatment of Anemia in the 3 Perisurgical Phases: A Review and 
      Analysis of the Current Literature.

AB  - Anemia is a common comorbidity throughout the entire hospital stay. Treatment 
      options include intravenous (IV) iron, oral iron, erythropoietin, and red blood cell 
      (RBC) transfusions. IV iron has gained in popularity with the implementation of 
      patient blood management programs. A variety of studies have been performed to 
      investigate the use of IV iron in preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative 
      settings. An objective review on these studies has yet to be performed. The current 
      narrative review provides an overview of trials investigating IV iron use in the 
      preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative settings. We performed a literature 
      research of English articles published between 1964 and March 2017 in Pubmed 
      including Medline and The Cochrane Library. Only studies with a control group were 
      included. The final review includes 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 7 
      observational trials, and 5 retrospective studies. Measured outcomes included 
      hemoglobin (Hb) levels, reticulocyte counts, and/or RBC concentrates. Meta-analyses 
      of RCTs using IV iron administration before surgery led to an increase in Hb levels, 
      a reduction of RBC use, and an improvement in patient outcome. Only a few studies 
      investigated the use of IV iron in the perioperative setting. These studies 
      recommended the use of perioperative IV iron in cases of severe anemia in orthopedic 
      surgery but not in all types of surgery. Published RCTs in the postoperative setting 
      have shown positive effects of IV iron on Hb levels, length of hospital stay, and 
      transfusion requirements. Some studies demonstrated an increase of Hb of 0.5-1 g/dL 
      over 4 weeks postoperatively, but the clinical relevance and effect of this increase 
      on an improvement of patient's long-term outcomes are uncertain. To summarize, the 
      evidence to use IV iron is strongest in the preoperative setting, while it remains 
      an individual treatment decision to administer IV iron perioperatively or 
      postoperatively.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mometasone has been reported to improve the symptoms of nasal 
      obstruction in children with adenoidal hypertrophy. This systematic review and 
      meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the role of mometasone on different nasal 
      symptoms, otitis media with effusion, adenoid size, and quality of life in children 
      with adenoidal hypertrophy. METHODS: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      CINAHL and COCHRANE Collaboration databases was undertaken. We identified all the 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in children with adenoidal hypertrophy that 
      compared the effects of mometasone nasal spray and normal saline nasal spray on 
      different outcomes. The deadline of the search was April 2015. The search was 
      supplemented by hand searching of cross-references in the studies and reviews and by 
      contacting the authors of various studies. Only English language RCTs were 
      considered for the systematic review. The primary outcomes were improvement in 
      symptoms of nasal obstruction, mouth breathing, rhinorrhea, snoring, cough, and 
      total nasal symptoms. The secondary outcomes were improvement in otitis media with 
      effusion, quality of life, and size of adenoid. Quality assessment of RCTs was 
      performed using SIGN 50 and Cochrane risk of bias tools. Risk ratio (RR), weighted 
      mean differences (WMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for 
      dichotomous and continuous data, respectively. Random effects model was used for the 
      analyses. Heterogeneity was measured by using the I(2) statistics and p value <0.05. 
      RESULTS: Our search generated 87 citations, of which eight RCTs met the inclusion 
      criteria. The methodological quality of all the RCTs was poor. There was no 
      significant difference between mometasone and control groups for the patient's 
      characteristic and grades of different nasal symptoms, otitis media with effusion, 
      obstructive sleep apnea, and quality of life at the basal level. There was also no 
      significant difference in the number of patients with different symptoms at the 
      basal level. After the administration of mometasone, there were significant 
      improvements in grades of nasal obstruction, 0.8±0.5 versus 2.0±0.6, WMD -1.16 
      [-2.09, -0.23], snoring 0.3±0.4 versus 1.6±0.6, WMD -1.07 [-2.09, -0.05], total 
      nasal symptoms 2.9±1.3 versus 6.9±1.5, WMD -4.09 [-6.64, -1.53], obstructive sleep 
      apnea, 0.6±0.3 versus 1.4±0.4, WMD -0.95 [-1.74, -0.16], as well as the percentage 
      of patients with nasal obstruction, snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, compared to 
      control. There was tendency of improvement in rhinorrhea, and cough with mometasone. 
      Compared to control, mometasone nasal spray significantly improved adenoid size or 
      adenoid/choana ratio 50.9±8.8 versus 74.2±12.6, WMD -21.2 [-34.0, -8.4], change in 
      adenoid/choana obstruction from the basal level (p=0.01), and percentage of patients 
      with adenoid hypertrophy, 26% versus 92%, RR 0.29 [0.18, 0.48]. There was 
      improvement in otitis media with effusion, 40% versus 72%, pure tone audiometry 
      5.2±11 versus 11.6±11dB, WMD -6.40dB [-12.65, -0.15], and quality of life with 
      mometasone. Subgroup analyses showed that RCTs that followed blinding showed 
      significantly less response compared to RCTs that did not follow it for most of the 
      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Mometasone caused improvements in outcomes of nasal 
      obstruction, snoring, total nasal symptoms, pure tune audiometry, otitis media with 
      effusion, adenoid size, and quality of life. The data is based on meta-analysis of 
      RCTs of poor methodological quality. A high methodological quality, placebo 
      controlled RCT of different doses and duration of administration of mometasone is 
      required to evaluate its clear efficacy and safety in children with adenoid 
      hypertrophy.

TI  - Efficacy of the combination neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, palonosetron, and 
      dexamethasone compared to others for the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea 
      and vomiting: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 221-233
LID - 10.21037/apm.2018.03.09 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), a common side effect of 
      chemotherapy, can substantially impair a patient's quality of life, interfere with a 
      patient's compliance with anticancer therapy, and result in the manifestation of 
      adverse events such as electrolyte imbalance, dehydration and malnutrition. The most 
      recent guidelines published by the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in 
      Cancer (MASCC) and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommend the 
      combination of dexamethasone (DEX), a 5-hydroxytrypatmine-3 receptor antagonist 
      (5-HT3RA), preferably palonosetron (PALO), and a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist 
      (NK1RA) for prophylactic treatment of CINV in patients receiving highly emetogenic 
      chemotherapy (HEC). The aim of this review was to examine the efficacy of triple 
      agent, as reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), compared to any other 
      prophylactic treatments. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in Ovid 
      MEDLINE(R), Embase Classic & Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving complete 
      response (CR) in the acute, delayed and overall phase. Secondary endpoints included 
      the percentage of patients who achieved complete control (CC), no nausea and no 
      vomiting in the acute, delayed and overall phases. RESULTS: A total of 17 RCTs were 
      included in this review, of which 3,146 patients were randomized to receive NK1RA, 
      PALO and DEX, and 2,987 patients to receive other antiemetic treatments. The 
      combination was not superior to other treatments in five endpoints-CC and CR in the 
      acute phase, nausea and emesis control in the delayed phase, and nausea in the 
      overall phase-but was superior in the other 11 endpoints. When looking only at HEC 
      and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) studies, the combination was only 
      superior to others in three endpoints (delayed and overall CC, and overall emesis 
      control) in HEC setting, which is less than the nine identified endpoints (delayed 
      and overall CR, delayed and overall CC, acute and overall nausea control, and acute, 
      delayed and overall phases for emesis control) in the MEC setting. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      combination of NK1RA, PALO and DEX is superior in the majority of assessed endpoints 
      of this meta-analysis. Further studies should investigate the efficacy and safety of 
      the triple regimen compared to regimens lacking NK1RA, to add to the discussions 
      about whether future CINV prophylaxis guidelines should include NK1RA as a 
      first-line treatment in the MEC setting.

TI  - Does the use of calcium ionophore during artificial oocyte activation demonstrate an 
      effect on pregnancy rate? A meta-analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect, if any, of calcium ionophore as a method of 
      artificial oocyte activation (AOA) on pregnancy outcomes and fertilization rates. 
      DESIGN: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, prospective observational and 
      retrospective trials, case reports, and a case-control trial. SETTING: 
      University-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENT(S): Infertile couples undergoing 
      fertilization treatment. INTERVENTION(S): Use of calcium ionophore during AOA. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Odds ratio (OR) as the summary statistic for binary variables 
      was used. Both a fixed and random effects model were applied. Subgroup analysis 
      using quantitative methodology (risk of bias, metaregression) and graphical 
      comparison (funnel plot) assessed statistical heterogeneity. RESULT(S): Fourteen 
      studies were selected. AOA with calcium ionophore increased the overall clinical 
      pregnancy rate (per ET; OR = 3.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-7.37) and the 
      live birth rate (OR = 3.33; 95% CI, 1.50-7.39). This effect of adding calcium 
      ionophore was further demonstrated with fertilization, cleavage, blastocyst, and 
      implantation rates. Subgroup analysis further supported our findings (studies where 
      n > 10 in both arms; random and fixed effects models). A metaregression (beta = 
      -.145) found that as the quality of the study increases, the effect of calcium 
      ionophore is significantly more pronounced with regards to overall pregnancy rate. 
      CONCLUSION(S): AOA with calcium ionophore treatment after intracytoplasmic sperm 
      injection (ICSI) results in a statistically significant improvement in 
      fertilization, cleavage, blastulation, and implantation rates, as well as overall 
      pregnancy and live-birth rates. The conclusion of this systematic review, 
      demonstrating a strong effect of calcium ionophore use, is reassuring and promising, 
      particularly for couples for whom ICSI alone yields poor fertilization rates.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of long-acting muscarinic antagonist monotherapies in COPD: a 
      systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - 2495-517
LID - 10.2147/COPD.S92412 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized, controlled trials comparing long-acting muscarinic 
      antagonist (LAMA) efficacy in COPD are limited. This network meta-analysis (NMA) 
      assessed the relative efficacy of tiotropium 18 µg once-daily (OD) and newer agents 
      (aclidinium 400 µg twice-daily, glycopyrronium 50 µg OD, and umeclidinium 62.5 µg 
      OD). METHODS: A systematic literature review identified randomized, controlled 
      trials of adult COPD patients receiving LAMAs. A NMA within a Bayesian framework 
      examined change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), 
      transitional dyspnea index focal score, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score, 
      and rescue medication use. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies (n=21,311) compared LAMAs 
      with placebo/each other. Aclidinium, glycopyrronium, tiotropium, and umeclidinium, 
      respectively, demonstrated favorable results versus placebo, for change from 
      baseline (95% credible interval) in 12-week trough FEV1 (primary endpoint: 101.40 mL 
      [77.06-125.60]; 117.20 mL [104.50-129.90]; 114.10 mL [103.10-125.20]; 136.70 mL 
      [104.20-169.20]); 24-week trough FEV1 (128.10 mL [84.10-172.00]; 135.80 mL 
      [123.10-148.30]; 106.40 mL [95.45-117.30]; 115.00 mL [74.51-155.30]); 24-week St 
      George's Respiratory Questionnaire score (-4.60 [-6.76 to -2.54]; -3.14 [-3.83 to 
      -2.45]; -2.43 [-2.92 to -1.93]; -4.69 [-7.05 to -2.31]); 24-week transitional 
      dyspnea index score (1.00 [0.41-1.59]; 1.01 [0.79-1.22]; 0.82 [0.62-1.02]; 1.00 
      [0.49-1.51]); and 24-week rescue medication use (data not available; -0.41 puffs/day 
      [-0.62 to -0.20]; -0.52 puffs/day [-0.74 to -0.30]; -0.30 puffs/day [-0.81 to 
      0.21]). For 12-week trough FEV1, differences in change from baseline (95% credible 
      interval) were -12.8 mL (-39.39 to 13.93), aclidinium versus tiotropium; 3.08 mL 
      (-7.58 to 13.69), glycopyrronium versus tiotropium; 22.58 mL (-11.58 to 56.97), 
      umeclidinium versus tiotropium; 15.90 mL (-11.60 to 43.15), glycopyrronium versus 
      aclidinium; 35.40 mL (-5.06 to 76.07), umeclidinium versus aclidinium; and 19.50 mL 
      (-15.30 to 54.38), umeclidinium versus glycopyrronium. Limitations included 
      inhaler-related factors and safety; longer-term outcomes were not considered. 
      CONCLUSION: The new LAMAs studied had at least comparable efficacy to tiotropium, 
      the established class standard. Choice should depend on physician's and patient's 
      preference.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of corifollitropin alfa in improving the 
      success of IVF. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: Not 
      applicable. PATIENT(S): Infertile women undergoing conventional IVF or 
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). INTERVENTION(S): Randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) of infertile women undergoing a single IVF/ICSI cycle with either 
      corifollitropin alfa or a conventional ovarian stimulation protocol based on daily 
      injections. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO before starting the data 
      extraction (CRD42018088605). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary outcomes were live 
      birth rate and/or ongoing pregnancy rate. Clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, 
      multiple pregnancies, number of oocytes and embryos obtained, cancellation rate, and 
      rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and ectopic pregnancy were considered as 
      secondary outcomes. RESULT(S): Eight randomized controlled trials were included; 
      2,345 women were assigned to the intervention group and 1,995 to the control group. 
      The analysis of 4,340 IVF cycles did not reveal any difference in live birth rate 
      and/or ongoing pregnancy rate between groups (risk ratio [RR], 0.92; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.80-1.05). Similarly, no difference was found in clinical pregnancy 
      rate (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88-1.05; I(2) = 0%), miscarriage rate (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 
      0.71-1.25; I(2) = 0%), or multiple pregnancy rate (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.99-1.50; I(2) 
      = 0%). Also, the rates of cycle cancellation, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and 
      ectopic pregnancy were similar in both groups. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses did 
      not provide statistical changes to pooled results. CONCLUSION(S): Corifollitropin 
      alfa seems to be an alternative for daily recombinant FSH injections in normal and 
      poor responder patients undergoing ovarian stimulation in IVF/ICSI treatment cycles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For airway management of intensive care unit (ICU) patients who are 
      intubated, a 5-10-mL bolus of sterile normal saline (NS) solution is commonly 
      instilled into an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube before suctioning. However, NS 
      instillation has been associated with adverse events such as dyspnea, increasing 
      heart rate, decreasing of oxygenation, blood pressure, and other vital parameters. 
      OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) to evaluate the necessity of NS instillation before suctioning in ICU 
      patients. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases 
      and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry were searched for studies published before May 
      2016. REVIEW METHODS: RCTs evaluating the outcome of NS instillation before 
      suctioning in ICU patients undergoing endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy were 
      included. Individual effect sizes were standardised, and a meta-analysis was 
      conducted to calculate the pooled effect size by using a random-effect model. The 
      primary outcome was the oxygen saturation immediately and 2 and 5min after 
      suctioning. The secondary outcomes were the heart rate and blood pressure after 
      suctioning. RESULTS: We reviewed 5 RCTs including 337 patients. Oxygen saturation 
      was significantly higher in the non-NS group than in the NS group 5min after 
      suctioning. The pooled mean difference in oxygen saturation was -1.14 (95% 
      confidence interval: -2.25 to -0.03). The heart rate and blood pressure did not 
      differ significantly between the non-NS and NS groups. CONCLUSION: NS instillation 
      before suctioning does not benefit patients undergoing endotracheal intubation or 
      tracheostomy. Moreover, it reduces oxygen saturation 5min after suction. However, 
      our reviewed studies had a low methodological quality. Thus, additional studies 
      involving large-scale RCTs are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is a malignant disease of plasma cells with a worldwide 
      incidence of 6-7 cases per 100 000 persons per year. It is among the 20 most common 
      types of cancer in Germany. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications 
      up to December 2015 that were retrieved by a selective search of PubMed employing 
      the terms "multiple myeloma" AND "therapy" OR "diagnostic." Systematic reviews, 
      meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and treatment recommendations from 
      Germany and abroad were considered. RESULTS: The diagnostic evaluation of multiple 
      myeloma comprises thorough history-taking and physical examination, various 
      laboratory tests including analysis of a 24-hour urine sample, a bone-marrow biopsy, 
      and skeletal radiography. Systemic treatment should be administered only when organ 
      damage has been diagnosed. The type of treatment to be given is chosen individually 
      on the basis of the patient's age, comorbidities, and risk profile. High-dose 
      therapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation remains the treatment of choice 
      for patients under age 70 who are otherwise in good health. For patients who are not 
      candidates for high-dose therapy or who have had a recurrence of multiple myeloma 
      after prior high-dose therapy, there are a number of further conventional treatment 
      options. Patients need not only systemic antineoplastic treatment, but also 
      supportive treatment for the prevention of treatment-induced toxicity and 
      myeloma-associated organ damage. CONCLUSION: Recent therapeutic advances have made 
      the treatment of multiple myeloma both more complex and more costly. In particular, 
      the median survival of patients with multiple myeloma has been markedly prolonged 
      through the use of targeted drugs such as proteasome inhibitors and immune 
      modulators.

TI  - Meta-analysis of continuous oral anticoagulants versus heparin bridging in patients 
      undergoing CIED surgery: reappraisal after the BRUISE study.
PG  - 417-23
LID - 10.1111/pace.12557 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of patients treated with oral anticoagulation (OAC) requiring 
      a cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) surgery is a challenge that 
      requires balancing the risk of bleeding complications with the risk of 
      thromboembolic events. Recently the approach of performing these procedures while 
      the patient remains with a therapeutic international normalized ratio has gained 
      interest due to several publications showing its relative safety. OBJECTIVES: To 
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of continuous use of OAC compared with heparin 
      bridging in the perioperative setting of CIED surgery using a meta-analysis. 
      METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed/MEDLINE, Ovid, and Elsevier databases was 
      performed. Eligible randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were included. 
      The outcomes studied were risk of clinically significant bleeding and of 
      thromboembolic events. Our analysis was restricted to OAC with vitamin K 
      antagonists. RESULTS: Of 560 manuscripts initially considered relevant, seven were 
      included in the meta-analysis, totaling 2,191 patients. Data are reported as odds 
      ratios (ORs) with confidence interval (CI) of 95%. Maintenance of OAC was associated 
      with a significantly lower risk of postoperative bleeding compared with heparin 
      bridge (OR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.17-0.36, P < 0.00001). There was no difference noted in 
      the risk of thromboembolic events between the two strategies (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 
      0.29-12.17, P = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Uninterrupted use of OAC in the perioperative of 
      CIED surgery was associated with a reduced risk of bleeding. This strategy should be 
      considered the preferred one in patients at moderate-to-high risk of thromboembolic 
      events.

TI  - Pharmacological interventions for pruritus in adult palliative care patients.
PG  - CD008320
LID - CD008320
AB  - BACKGROUND: This is an update of the original Cochrane review published in 2013 
      (Issue 6). Pruritus occurs in patients with disparate underlying diseases and is 
      caused by different pathologic mechanisms. In palliative care patients, pruritus is 
      not the most prevalent but is one of the most puzzling symptoms. It can cause 
      considerable discomfort and affects patients' quality of life. OBJECTIVES: To assess 
      the effects of different pharmacological treatments for preventing or treating 
      pruritus in adult palliative care patients. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we 
      searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), and MEDLINE (OVID) up to 9 June 2016 and 
      Embase (OVID) up to 7 June 2016. In addition, we searched trial registries and 
      checked the reference lists of all relevant studies, key textbooks, reviews and 
      websites, and we contacted investigators and specialists in pruritus and palliative 
      care regarding unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised 
      controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of different pharmacological 
      treatments, compared with a placebo, no treatment, or an alternative treatment, for 
      preventing or treating pruritus in palliative care patients. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the identified titles and 
      abstracts, performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias and 
      methodological quality. We summarised the results descriptively and quantitatively 
      (meta-analyses) according to the different pharmacological interventions and the 
      diseases associated with pruritus. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of 
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created 10 'Summary of 
      findings' tables. MAIN RESULTS: In total, we included 50 studies and 1916 
      participants in the review. We added 10 studies with 627 participants for this 
      update. Altogether, we included 39 different treatments for pruritus in four 
      different patient groups.The overall risk of bias profile was heterogeneous and 
      ranged from high to low risk. However, 48 studies (96%) had a high risk of bias due 
      to low sample size (i.e. fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm). Using GRADE 
      criteria, we downgraded our judgement on the quality of evidence to moderate in 
      seven and to low in three comparisons for our primary outcome (pruritus), mainly due 
      to imprecision and risk of bias.In palliative care participants with pruritus of 
      different nature, the treatment with the drug paroxetine, a selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor, reduced pruritus by 0.78 points (numerical analogue scale from 0 
      to 10; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.19 to -0.37; one RCT, N = 48, quality of 
      evidence: moderate) compared to placebo.For participants suffering from uraemic 
      pruritus (UP), gabapentin was more effective than placebo (visual analogue scale 
      (VAS): 0 to 10), mean difference (MD) -5.91, 95% CI -6.87 to -4.96; two RCTs, N = 
      118, quality of evidence: moderate). The κ-opioid receptor agonist nalfurafine 
      showed amelioration of UP (VAS 0 to 10, MD -0.95, 95% CI -1.32 to -0.58; three RCTs, 
      N = 422, quality of evidence: moderate) and only few adverse events. Moreover, 
      cromolyn sodium relieved UP participants from pruritus by 2.94 points on the VAS (0 
      to 10) (95% CI -4.04 to -1.83; two RCTs, N = 100, quality of evidence: moderate) 
      compared to placebo.In participants with cholestatic pruritus (CP), data favoured 
      rifampin (VAS: 0 to 100, MD -24.64, 95% CI -31.08 to -18.21; two RCTs, N = 42, 
      quality of evidence: low) and flumecinol (RR > 1 favours treatment group; RR 1.89, 
      95% CI 1.05 to 3.39; two RCTs, N = 69, quality of evidence: low) and showed a low 
      incidence of adverse events in comparison with placebo. The opioid antagonist 
      naltrexone reduced pruritus for participants with CP (VAS: 0 to 10, MD -2.26, 95% CI 
      -3.19 to -1.33; two RCTs, N = 52, quality of evidence: moderate) compared to 
      placebo. However, effects in participants with UP were inconclusive (percentage 
      difference -12.30%, 95% CI -25.82% to 1.22%, one RCT, N = 32). Furthermore, large 
      doses of opioid antagonists (e.g. naltrexone) could be inappropriate in palliative 
      care patients because of the risk of reducing analgesia.For participants with 
      HIV-associated pruritus, it is uncertain whether drug treatment with hydroxyzine 
      hydrochloride, pentoxifylline, triamcinolone or indomethacin reduces pruritus 
      because the evidence was of very low quality (e.g. small sample size, lack of 
      blinding). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Different interventions tended to be effective for 
      CP and UP. However, therapies for patients with malignancies are still lacking. Due 
      to the small sample sizes in most meta-analyses and the heterogeneous methodological 
      quality of the included trials, the results should be interpreted cautiously in 
      terms of generalisability.

LID - e030596
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of drug interventions that may modify the 
      progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults with CKD stages 3 and 4. 
      DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, International Clinical Trials 
      Registry Platform, Health Technology Assessment, Science Citation Index, Social 
      Sciences Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index and Clinical Trials 
      Register, from March 1999 to July 2018, we identified randomised controlled trials 
      (RCTs) of drugs for hypertension, lipid modification, glycaemic control and sodium 
      bicarbonate, compared with placebo, no drug or a drug from another class, in ≥40 
      adults with CKD stages 3 and/or 4, with at least 2 years of follow-up and reporting 
      renal function (primary outcome), proteinuria, adverse events, maintenance dialysis, 
      transplantation, cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality or all-cause 
      mortality. Two reviewers independently screened citations and extracted data. For 
      continuous outcomes, we used the ratio of means (ROM) at the end of the trial in 
      random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed methodological quality with the Cochrane 
      Risk of Bias Tool and confidence in the evidence using the Grading of 
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. RESULTS: 
      We included 35 RCTs and over 51 000 patients. Data were limited, and heterogeneity 
      varied. Final renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) was 6% higher in 
      those taking glycaemic control drugs (ROM 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10, I(2)=0%, low 
      GRADE confidence) and 4% higher in those taking lipid-modifying drugs (ROM 1.04, 95% 
      CI 1.00 to 1.08, I(2)=88%, very low GRADE confidence). For RCTs of antihypertensive 
      drugs, there were no significant differences in renal function. Treatment with 
      lipid-modifying drugs led to a 36% reduction in cardiovascular disease and 26% 
      reduction in all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Glycaemic control and lipid-modifying 
      drugs may slow the progression of CKD, but we found no pooled evidence of benefit 
      nor harm from antihypertensive drugs. However, given the data limitations, further 
      research is needed to confirm these findings. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER:

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review was to summarize the evidence 
      regarding probiotics treatment for pediatric IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: The overall 
      management of children with IBS should be tailored to the patient's specific 
      symptoms and identifiable triggers. The four major therapeutic approaches include: 
      pharmacologic, dietary, psychosocial, and complementary/alternative medicine 
      interventions.Although there is limited evidence for efficacy of pharmacological 
      therapies such as antispasmodics and anti-diarrheals, these may have a role in 
      severe cases. A Cochrane review concluded that only weak evidence exists regarding 
      beneficial effects of pharmacological agents in providing relief from symptoms in 
      functional abdominal pain (AP) in children. Role of antibiotics in treatment of 
      children with IBS remains controversial. Various non-pharmacologic treatments are 
      available for pediatric IBS. In a recent systematic review including 24 studies some 
      evidence was found indicating beneficial effects of partially hydrolyzed guar gum 
      (PHGG), cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy, and probiotics (LGG and 
      VSL#3).Few randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are available in children. A 
      meta-analysis including 9 trials which tested different probiotics as a treatment 
      for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDs) in children and adolescents 
      concluded that Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and VSL#3 
      significantly increased treatment success. We recently showed that, in children with 
      IBS, a mixture of Bifidobacterium infantis M-63®, breve M-16V® and longum BB536® is 
      safe and is associated with better AP control and improved quality of life when 
      compared to placebo. SUMMARY: Probiotics are emerging as new therapeutic tools in 
      FGIDs, due to the recognition of the importance of gut microbiota in influencing 
      brain-gut interactions, and of the role played by intestinal infections in the 
      genesis of AP-FGIDs. Preclinical data suggest that changes in the gut microbiota can 
      affect brain signaling systems related to pain and associated emotional behavior. 
      Therefore, probiotics could play a relevant role in the management of FGIDs, by 
      affecting the gut microbiota or by altering brain function and pain perception 
      centrally.

TI  - Avoidance versus use of neuromuscular blocking agents for improving conditions 
      during tracheal intubation or direct laryngoscopy in adults and adolescents.
PG  - CD009237

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tracheal intubation during induction of general anaesthesia is a vital 
      procedure performed to secure a patient's airway. Several studies have identified 
      difficult tracheal intubation (DTI) or failed tracheal intubation as one of the 
      major contributors to anaesthesia-related mortality and morbidity. Use of 
      neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) to facilitate tracheal intubation is a widely 
      accepted practice. However, because of adverse effects, NMBA may be undesirable. 
      Cohort studies have indicated that avoiding NMBA is an independent risk factor for 
      difficult and failed tracheal intubation. However, no systematic review of 
      randomized trials has evaluated conditions for tracheal intubation, possible adverse 
      effects, and postoperative discomfort. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of 
      avoiding neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) versus using NMBA on difficult 
      tracheal intubation (DTI) for adults and adolescents allocated to tracheal 
      intubation with direct laryngoscopy. To look at various outcomes, conduct subgroup 
      and sensitivity analyses, examine the role of bias, and apply trial sequential 
      analysis (TSA) to examine the level of available evidence for this intervention. 
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, International Web of 
      Science, LILACS, advanced Google, CINAHL, and the following trial registries: 
      Current Controlled Trials; ClinicalTrials.gov; and www.centerwatch.com, up to 
      January 2017. We checked the reference lists of included trials and reviews to look 
      for unidentified trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of avoiding versus using NMBA in 
      participants 14 years of age or older. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review 
      authors extracted data independently. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect 
      meta-analyses and calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs). We used published data and data obtained by contacting trial authors. To 
      minimize the risk of systematic error, we assessed the risk of bias of included 
      trials. To reduce the risk of random errors caused by sparse data and repetitive 
      updating of cumulative meta-analyses, we applied TSA. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 34 
      RCTs with 3565 participants that met our inclusion criteria. All trials reported on 
      conditions for tracheal intubation; seven trials with 846 participants described 
      'events of upper airway discomfort or injury', and 13 trials with 1308 participants 
      reported on direct laryngoscopy. All trials used a parallel design. We identified 18 
      dose-finding studies that included more interventions or control groups or both. All 
      trials except three included only American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 
      I and II participants, 25 trials excluded participants with anticipated DTI, and 
      obesity or overweight was an excluding factor in 13 studies. Eighteen trials used 
      suxamethonium, and 18 trials used non-depolarizing NMBA.Trials with an overall low 
      risk of bias reported significantly increased risk of DTI with no use of NMBA 
      (random-effects model) (RR 13.27, 95% CI 8.19 to 21.49; P < 0.00001; 508 
      participants; four trials; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome 
      (NNTH) = 1.9, I(2) = 0%, D(2) = 0%, GRADE = moderate). The TSA-adjusted CI for the 
      RR was 1.85 to 95.04. Inclusion of all trials resulted in confirmation of results 
      and of significantly increased risk of DTI when an NMBA was avoided (random-effects 
      model) (RR 5.00, 95% CI 3.49 to 7.15; P < 0.00001; 3565 participants; 34 trials; 
      NNTH = 6.3, I(2) = 70%, D(2) = 82%, GRADE = low). Again the cumulative z-curve 
      crossed the TSA monitoring boundary, demonstrating harmful effects of avoiding NMBA 
      on the proportion of DTI with minimal risk of random error. We categorized only one 
      trial reporting on upper airway discomfort or injury as having overall low risk of 
      bias. Inclusion of all trials revealed significant risk of upper airway discomfort 
      or injury when an NMBA was avoided (random-effects model) (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09 to 
      1.74; P = 0.008; 846 participants; seven trials; NNTH = 9.1, I(2) = 13%, GRADE = 
      moderate). The TSA-adjusted CI for the RR was 1.00 to 1.85. None of these trials 
      reported mortality. In terms of our secondary outcome 'difficult laryngoscopy', we 
      categorized only one trial as having overall low risk of bias. All trials avoiding 
      NMBA were significantly associated with difficult laryngoscopy (random-effects 
      model) (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.21; P = 0.0003; 1308 participants; 13 trials; NNTH 
      = 25.6, I(2) = 0%, D(2)= 0%, GRADE = low); however, TSA showed that only 6% of the 
      information size required to detect or reject a 20% relative risk reduction (RRR) 
      was accrued, and the trial sequential monitoring boundary was not crossed. AUTHORS' 
      CONCLUSIONS: This review supports that use of an NMBA may create the best conditions 
      for tracheal intubation and may reduce the risk of upper airway discomfort or injury 
      following tracheal intubation. Study results were characterized by indirectness, 
      heterogeneity, and high or uncertain risk of bias concerning our primary outcome 
      describing difficult tracheal intubation. Therefore, we categorized the GRADE 
      classification of quality of evidence as moderate to low. In light of defined 
      outcomes of individual included trials, our primary outcomes may not reflect a 
      situation that many clinicians consider to be an actual difficult tracheal 
      intubation by which the patient's life or health may be threatened.

TI  - Effect of High-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy Versus Conventional Oxygen Therapy 
      and Noninvasive Ventilation on Reintubation Rate in Adult Patients After Extubation: 
      A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 609-623
LID - 10.1177/0885066617705118 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) on 
      reintubation in adult patients. PROCEDURES: Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane 
      Database of Systematic Reviews were searched up to November 1, 2016, for RCTs 
      comparing HFNC versus conventional oxygen therapy (COT) or noninvasive ventilation 
      (NIV) in adult patients after extubation. The primary outcome was reintubation rate, 
      and the secondary outcomes included complications, tolerance and comfort, time to 
      reintubation, length of stay, and mortality. Dichotomous outcomes were presented as 
      risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous outcomes as 
      weighted mean difference and 95% CIs. The random effects model was used for data 
      pooling. FINDINGS: Seven RCTs involving 2781 patients were included in the analysis. 
      The HFNC had a similar reintubation rate compared to either COT (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 
      0.21-1.60; P = .29; 5 RCTs, n = 1347) or NIV (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.88-1.40; P = .37; 
      2 RCTs, n = 1434). In subgroup of critically ill patients, the HFNC group had a 
      significantly lower reintubation rate compared to the COT group (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 
      0.19-0.64; P = .0007; 2 RCTs, n = 632; interaction P = .07 compared to postoperative 
      subgroup). Qualitative analysis suggested that HFNC might be associated with less 
      complications and improved patient's tolerance and comfort. The HFNC might not delay 
      reintubation. Trial sequential analysis on the primary outcome showed that required 
      information size was not reached. CONCLUSION: The evidence suggests that COT may 
      still be the first-line therapy in postoperative patients without acute respiratory 
      failure. However, in critically ill patients, HFNC may be a potential alternative 
      respiratory support to COT and NIV, with the latter often associating with patient 
      intolerance and requiring a monitored setting. Because required information size was 
      not reached, further high-quality studies are required to confirm these results.

TI  - Nurse practitioner-led transitional care interventions: An integrative review.
PG  - 773-790
LID - 10.1002/2327-6924.12509 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chronically ill patients 65 and above have an increased risk 
      of preventable readmission within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. The 
      Transitional Care Model (TCM) introduced by Naylor and colleagues was implemented to 
      improve the transition between hospital and home while decreasing readmissions. This 
      article examines whether nurse practitioner (NP)- led TCM interventions as compared 
      to standard care decrease hospital readmission rates in older adults. METHODS: A 
      literature review was conducted from June 2016 to March 2017 using Cochrane Library, 
      PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Health Literature (CINAHL) PLUS, Joanna 
      Briggs Institute, and ProQuest Central to seek out the highest level of evidence. 
      Search results were refined to focus on randomized control trials (RTCs) containing 
      NP-led TCM interventions with older adults. CONCLUSIONS: Synthesis of three RTCs, 
      one meta-analysis, and four nonrandomized studies reviewed TCM interventions that 
      included these interventions: follow-up phone calls post discharge, home visits, and 
      handoff of information to the patient's primary care provider. These interventions, 
      although not exclusively led by NPs, decreased hospital readmission rates. 
      IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: NP-led TCM interventions have the potential to decrease 
      readmissions, but the level of evidence is insufficiently high to allow for 
      generalizability, warranting further study.

TI  - Prebiotic and probiotic treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 822-839
LID - 10.1093/nutrit/nuy031 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent and 
      underdiagnosed comorbidity of many chronic diseases that is associated with altered 
      intestinal bacterial communities. This association has prompted research into 
      alternative treatments aimed at modulating intestinal microbiota. Given the novelty 
      of these treatments, scarce evidence regarding their effectiveness in clinical 
      populations exists. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis sought to systemically review and 
      quantitatively synthesize evidence on prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic therapies 
      for patients with NAFLD in randomized controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: PRISMA 
      guidelines ensured transparent reporting of evidence. PICOS criteria defined the 
      research question for the systematic review. A systematic keyword search in PubMed 
      and EMBASE identified 25 studies: 9 assessed prebiotic, 11 assessed probiotic, and 7 
      assessed symbiotic therapies for a total of 1309 patients. DATA EXTRACTION: Basic 
      population characteristics, the primary variables of aspartate aminotransferase 
      (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (utilized for NAFLD diagnosis), and the 
      secondary variables of body mass index (BMI), gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), 
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), total cholesterol, 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
      (LDL-c), and triglyceridges (TAG) were extracted. Pooled effect sizes of these 
      variables were calculated by meta-analysis. No publication bias was identified using 
      Begg's and Egger's tests or Cochrane bias assessment tool. RESULTS: Meta-analysis 
      indicated that microbial therapies significantly reduced BMI (-0.37 kg/m2; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], -0.46 to -0.28; P < 0.001), hepatic enzymes (ALT, -6.9 U/L 
      [95%CI, -9.4 to -4.3]; AST, -4.6 U/L [95%CI, -6.6 to -2.7]; γ-GT, -7.9 U/L [95%CI, 
      -11.4 to -4.4]; P < 0.001), serum cholesterol (-10.1 mg/dL 95%CI, -13.6 to -6.6; 
      P < 0.001), LDL-c (-4.5 mg/dL; 95%CI, -8.9 to -0.17; P < 0.001), and TAG 
      (-10.1 mg/dL; 95%CI, -18.0 to -2.3; P < 0.001), but not inflammation (TNF-α, 
      -2.0 ng/mL; [95%CI, -4.7 to 0.61]; CRP, -0.74 mg/L [95%CI, -1.9 to 0.37]). Subgroup 
      analysis by treatment category indicated similar effects of prebiotics and 
      probiotics on BMI and liver enzymes but not total cholesterol, HDL-c, and LDL-c. 
      CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis supports the potential use of microbial therapies in 
      the treatment of NAFLD and sheds light on their potential mode of action. Further 
      research into these treatments should consider the limitations of biomarkers 
      currently used for the diagnosis and progression of NAFLD, in addition to the 
      inherent challenges of personalized microbial-based therapies.

TI  - Effectiveness of semen washing to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
      transmission and assist pregnancy in HIV-discordant couples: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of semen washing in human immunodeficiency 
      virus (HIV)-discordant couples in which the male partner is infected. DESIGN: 
      Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Forty 
      single-arm open-label studies among HIV-discordant couples that underwent 
      intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF) with or without 
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using washed semen. INTERVENTION(S): Semen 
      washing followed by IUI, IVF, or IVF/ICSI. PRIMARY OUTCOME: HIV transmission to 
      HIV-uninfected women; secondary outcomes: HIV transmission to newborns and 
      proportion of couples achieving a clinical pregnancy. RESULT(S): No HIV transmission 
      occurred in 11,585 cycles of assisted reproduction with the use of washed semen 
      among 3,994 women. Among the subset of HIV-infected men without plasma viral 
      suppression at the time of semen washing, no HIV seroconversions occurred among 
      1,023 women after 2,863 cycles of assisted reproduction with the use of washed 
      semen. Studies that measured HIV transmission to infants reported no cases of 
      vertical transmission. Overall, 56.3% of couples (2,357/4,184) achieved a clinical 
      pregnancy with the use of washed semen. CONCLUSION(S): Semen washing appears to 
      significantly reduce the risk of transmission in HIV-discordant couples desiring 
      children, regardless of viral suppression in the male partner. There are no 
      randomized controlled studies or studies from low-income countries, especially those 
      with a large burden of HIV. Continued development of lower-cost semen washing and 
      assisted reproduction technologies is needed. Integration of semen washing into HIV 
      prevention interventions could help to further reduce the spread of HIV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory drugs in patients 
      with noninfectious anterior uveitis (AU). METHODS: Systematic review of studies were 
      retrieved from Medline (1961 to March 2016), Embase (1961 to March 2016), and 
      Cochrane Library (up to March 2016), and a complementary hand search was also 
      performed. The selection criteria were as follows: (population) noninfectious AU 
      patients, adults; (intervention) immunomodulatory drugs (any dose, regimen, route of 
      administration, duration of treatment); (outcome) control of inflammation, 
      steroid-sparing effect, AU flares, adverse events, and so on; (study design) 
      systematic literature reviews, randomized controlled trials, and observational 
      studies. The study quality was assessed using the Jadad scale and according to The 
      Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (update 2009). RESULTS: We included 13 
      studies of moderate-poor quality, with a mean duration from 5 months to 20 years, 
      and number of AU patients ranging from 9 to 274. Patient's demographic and clinical 
      characteristics were very heterogeneous. In most cases, uveitis anatomic 
      classification criteria and outcomes definitions were unclear. Some of the studies 
      only included AU patients with a systemic disease associated, mostly 
      spondyloarthritis, others, mixed populations (idiopathic and systemic disease 
      associated patients), and in some articles this data is not described. We found that 
      methotrexate, cyclosporine A, azathioprine, adalimumab, and golimumab might prevent 
      AU flares, improve ocular inflammation and visual acuity, and decrease systemic 
      steroids doses. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is a lack of robust evidence, 
      methotrexate, cyclosporine A, azathioprine, adalimumab, and golimumab might be 
      effective in AU patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a promising therapeutic strategy after 
      cardiothoracic surgery. This study aimed to meta-analyze the efficacy and safety of 
      NIV as compared to conventional management after cardiothoracic surgery. METHODS: 
      PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NIV with conventional management after 
      cardiothoracic surgery. Relative risk (RR), standard mean difference (SMD), and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) were used to measure the efficacy and safety of NIV using 
      random-effects model. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Q statistic. RESULTS: 
      This study included 14 RCTs (1740 patients) for the evaluation of efficacy and 
      safety of NIV as compared to conventional management after cardiothoracic surgery. 
      Overall, NIV had minimal effect on the risk of mortality (RR: 0.64; 95% CI: 
      0.36-1.14; P = 0.127), endotracheal intubation (RR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.24-1.11; P = 
      0.090), respiratory (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.47-1.30; P = 0.340), cardiovascular (RR: 
      0.81; 95% CI: 0.54-1.22; P = 0.306), renal (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.26-1.92; P = 0.491), 
      and other complications (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.38-1.36; P = 0.305), respiratory rate 
      (SMD: -0.10; 95% CI: -1.21-1.01; P = 0.862), heart rate (SMD: -0.27; 95% CI: 
      -0.76-0.22; P = 0.288), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (SMD: 0.34; 95% CI: -0.17-0.85; P = 0.194), 
      PaCO2 (SMD: 0.83; 95% CI: -0.12-1.77; P = 0.087), systolic pressure (SMD: -0.04; 95% 
      CI: -0.25-0.17; P = 0.700), pH (SMD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.44-0.43; P = 0.974), length 
      of ICU stay (SMD: -0.19; 95% CI: -0.47-0.08; P = 0.171), and hospital stay (SMD: 
      -0.31; 95% CI: -1.00-0.38; P = 0.373). Sensitivity analysis showed that NIV was 
      associated with higher levels of PaO2/FiO2 ratio (SMD: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.00-1.05; P = 
      0.048) and lower risk of endotracheal intubation (RR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.22-0.66; P = 
      0.001). CONCLUSION: As compared to conventional management, the use of NIV after 
      cardiothoracic surgery improved patient's oxygenation and decreased the need for 
      endotracheal intubation, without significant complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential of using mobile phone technologies to improve 
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence has provided a new facet to human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) research. The quality of evidence and the strength of 
      recommendations of existing reviews, however, do not adequately support large-scale 
      adoption of the intervention. This review adopted broad selection criteria to 
      include all mobile phone-based interventions designed to improve patient's adherence 
      to ART. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized 
      controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies. PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      PsychINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, AMED 
      and Web of Science were searched. Online abstracts archives of relevant conference 
      proceedings and trial registries were also searched. Thirty-Five (35) full-text 
      articles were assessed for eligibility. Included studies were conducted in high, low 
      and middle-income countries and reported ART adherence interventions delivered by 
      mobile phones (standard or smartphones) in the form of voice calls, interactive 
      voice response calls (IVR), and short message service (SMS). RESULTS: Thirteen (13) 
      studies met the inclusion criteria, and 11 were used in the meta-analysis. 
      Intervention characteristics of included studies ranged from mobile phone 
      functionalities to provision of study phones to participants. SMS and voice call 
      contents were tailored to participants' specific adherence needs. Mobile SMS 
      interventions improved adherence to ART compared with control conditions (OR, 95% CI 
      = 1.59, 1.27-1.98). In subgroup analysis, only scheduled SMS was significant whereas 
      triggered SMS had no effect on adherence to ART. Mobile voice calls did not 
      significantly increase adherence to ART. The interventions were highly rated by > 
      90% of participants in the studies that reported on the experiences and satisfaction 
      with the intervention. CONCLUSION: Scheduled mobile phone text-messaging have 
      demonstrated significant improvement in adherence to ART. Mobile SMS adherence 
      interventions that allow for two-way communication may, however, be more acceptable 
      than standalone SMS reminders, which are seen to be intrusive, producing habituation 
      and response fatigue. Voice calls and triggered SMS functionalities do not have a 
      significant effect on adherence to ART although there is a higher preference for 
      voice functionality over SMS especially in limited-resource and low-literacy 
      settings. Further exploration of the mobile voice functionality and its possible 
      combination with scheduled SMS functionality is recommended. Evidence provided in 
      this study will guide the implementation of mobile phone intervention to improve 
      adherence to ART, by addressing practical challenges that could militate against 
      scalability especially in resource limited settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to summarize all aspects of middle ear 
      diseases in children with cleft palate (CP). METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, The Cumulative 
      Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and The Cochrane Library were 
      searched for English-language randomized control trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, 
      systematic reviews and observational studies published through 31st July 2017. 
      RESULTS: Epidemiology and pathogenesis of middle ear diseases in children with cleft 
      palate have been discussed in this review. Methods of Evaluation, CP surgeries, 
      complications and follow up have been detailed for the same. CONCLUSION: Evaluation 
      of middle-ear disease in children with CP begins at birth by a newborn hearing 
      screen. Tympanometry and otoscopy helps screen for middle-ear disease during 
      follow-up visits. Ventilation tube may be placed when indicated based on the 
      patient's clinical course and presentation. Long-term follow up should be provided 
      to look for the development of cholesteatoma.

TI  - Effectiveness of patient-centered interventions on falls in the acute care setting 
      compared to usual care: a systematic review.
PG  - 3006-3048
LID - 10.11124/JBISRIR-2016-003331 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unintentional falls during hospitalization remain a concern for 
      healthcare institutions globally despite implementation of various improvement 
      strategies. Although the incidence of falls has been of heightened focus for many 
      years and numerous studies have been done evaluating different approaches for fall 
      prevention, fall rates remain high in acute care settings. Patient fall risk scales 
      tend to address only particular intrinsic and extrinsic factors but do not 
      adequately assess a patient's current fall risk status, subsequently warranting more 
      patient-centered risk assessments and interventions. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the 
      effectiveness of patient-centered interventions on falls in the acute care setting. 
      INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients admitted to medical or 
      surgical acute care units for any condition or illness. TYPES OF INTERVENTION(S): 
      Patient-centered intervention strategies to reduce falls compared to usual care. 
      TYPES OF STUDIES: Randomized control trials. TYPES OF OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: 
      fall rates or number of falls. Secondary outcome: fall-related injuries. SEARCH 
      STRATEGY: A comprehensive search strategy aimed to find relevant published and 
      unpublished quantitative, English language studies from the inception of databases 
      through July 30, 2016 was undertaken. Databases searched included: PubMed, CINAHL, 
      Embase and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition. A search for unpublished studies 
      was also performed using ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, the New York Academy of 
      Medicine and the Virginia Henderson e-Repository. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Reviewers 
      evaluated the included studies for methodological quality using the standardized 
      critical appraisal instrument form from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA 
      EXTRACTION: Quantitative data were extracted from papers included in the review 
      using the standardized data extraction form from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity among the included 
      studies, a meta-analysis was not possible. The findings of this review have been 
      presented in narrative form. RESULTS: Five randomized control trials were included. 
      Three studies demonstrated statistically significant reductions in fall rates 
      (p < 0.04) while two studies showed no difference in fall rates between groups 
      (p > 0.5). In the three studies that demonstrated reduced fall rates, personalized 
      care plans and patient-centered education based on patients' fall risk results were 
      utilized. Three studies measured the secondary outcome of fall-related injuries; 
      however, results demonstrated no difference in fall-related injuries between groups 
      (p > 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of this review indicates patient-centered 
      interventions in addition to tailored patient education may have the potential to be 
      effective in reducing falls and fall rates in acute care hospitals. There is limited 
      high quality evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of patient-centered fall 
      prevention interventions so novel solutions are urgently needed and warrant more 
      rigorous, larger scale randomized trials for more robust estimates of effect.

TI  - Cannabis-based medicines for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.
PG  - CD012182
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD012182.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD012182
AB  - BACKGROUND: This review is one of a series on drugs used to treat chronic 
      neuropathic pain. Estimates of the population prevalence of chronic pain with 
      neuropathic components range between 6% and 10%. Current pharmacological treatment 
      options for neuropathic pain afford substantial benefit for only a few people, often 
      with adverse effects that outweigh the benefits. There is a need to explore other 
      treatment options, with different mechanisms of action for treatment of conditions 
      with chronic neuropathic pain. Cannabis has been used for millennia to reduce pain. 
      Herbal cannabis is currently strongly promoted by some patients and their advocates 
      to treat any type of chronic pain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy, tolerability, 
      and safety of cannabis-based medicines (herbal, plant-derived, synthetic) compared 
      to placebo or conventional drugs for conditions with chronic neuropathic pain in 
      adults. SEARCH METHODS: In November 2017 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and 
      two trials registries for published and ongoing trials, and examined the reference 
      lists of reviewed articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised, double-blind 
      controlled trials of medical cannabis, plant-derived and synthetic cannabis-based 
      medicines against placebo or any other active treatment of conditions with chronic 
      neuropathic pain in adults, with a treatment duration of at least two weeks and at 
      least 10 participants per treatment arm. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review 
      authors independently extracted data of study characteristics and outcomes of 
      efficacy, tolerability and safety, examined issues of study quality, and assessed 
      risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. For efficacy, we calculated 
      the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for pain 
      relief of 30% and 50% or greater, patient's global impression to be much or very 
      much improved, dropout rates due to lack of efficacy, and the standardised mean 
      differences for pain intensity, sleep problems, health-related quality of life 
      (HRQoL), and psychological distress. For tolerability, we calculated number needed 
      to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) for withdrawal due to adverse 
      events and specific adverse events, nervous system disorders and psychiatric 
      disorders. For safety, we calculated NNTH for serious adverse events. Meta-analysis 
      was undertaken using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence 
      using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 
      studies with 1750 participants. The studies were 2 to 26 weeks long and compared an 
      oromucosal spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 
      cannabidiol (CBD) (10 studies), a synthetic cannabinoid mimicking THC (nabilone) 
      (two studies), inhaled herbal cannabis (two studies) and plant-derived THC 
      (dronabinol) (two studies) against placebo (15 studies) and an analgesic 
      (dihydrocodeine) (one study). We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess 
      study quality. We defined studies with zero to two unclear or high risks of bias 
      judgements to be high-quality studies, with three to five unclear or high risks of 
      bias to be moderate-quality studies, and with six to eight unclear or high risks of 
      bias to be low-quality studies. Study quality was low in two studies, moderate in 12 
      studies and high in two studies. Nine studies were at high risk of bias for study 
      size. We rated the quality of the evidence according to GRADE as very low to 
      moderate.Primary outcomesCannabis-based medicines may increase the number of people 
      achieving 50% or greater pain relief compared with placebo (21% versus 17%; risk 
      difference (RD) 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.09); NNTB 20 (95% CI 11 
      to 100); 1001 participants, eight studies, low-quality evidence). We rated the 
      evidence for improvement in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) with cannabis 
      to be of very low quality (26% versus 21%;RD 0.09 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.17); NNTB 11 
      (95% CI 6 to 100); 1092 participants, six studies). More participants withdrew from 
      the studies due to adverse events with cannabis-based medicines (10% of 
      participants) than with placebo (5% of participants) (RD 0.04 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07); 
      NNTH 25 (95% CI 16 to 50); 1848 participants, 13 studies, moderate-quality 
      evidence). We did not have enough evidence to determine if cannabis-based medicines 
      increase the frequency of serious adverse events compared with placebo (RD 0.01 (95% 
      CI -0.01 to 0.03); 1876 participants, 13 studies, low-quality evidence).Secondary 
      outcomesCannabis-based medicines probably increase the number of people achieving 
      pain relief of 30% or greater compared with placebo (39% versus 33%; RD 0.09 (95% CI 
      0.03 to 0.15); NNTB 11 (95% CI 7 to 33); 1586 participants, 10 studies, moderate 
      quality evidence). Cannabis-based medicines may increase nervous system adverse 
      events compared with placebo (61% versus 29%; RD 0.38 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.58); NNTH 3 
      (95% CI 2 to 6); 1304 participants, nine studies, low-quality evidence). Psychiatric 
      disorders occurred in 17% of participants using cannabis-based medicines and in 5% 
      using placebo (RD 0.10 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.15); NNTH 10 (95% CI 7 to 16); 1314 
      participants, nine studies, low-quality evidence).We found no information about 
      long-term risks in the studies analysed.Subgroup analysesWe are uncertain whether 
      herbal cannabis reduces mean pain intensity (very low-quality evidence). Herbal 
      cannabis and placebo did not differ in tolerability (very low-quality evidence). 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The potential benefits of cannabis-based medicine (herbal 
      cannabis, plant-derived or synthetic THC, THC/CBD oromucosal spray) in chronic 
      neuropathic pain might be outweighed by their potential harms. The quality of 
      evidence for pain relief outcomes reflects the exclusion of participants with a 
      history of substance abuse and other significant comorbidities from the studies, 
      together with their small sample sizes.

TI  - Effectiveness of nursing discharge planning interventions on health-related outcomes 
      in discharged elderly inpatients: a systematic review.
PG  - 217-260
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate discharge planning for the growing elderly population poses 
      significant challenges for health services. Effective discharge planning 
      interventions have been examined in several studies, but little information is 
      available on nursing's role or the specific components of these interventions. 
      Despite the research published on the importance of discharge planning, the impact 
      on patient's health outcomes still needs to be proven in practice. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the best available evidence on the effectiveness of discharge planning 
      interventions involving at least one nurse on health-related outcomes for elderly 
      inpatients discharged home and to assess the relative impact of individual 
      components of discharge planning interventions. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF 
      PARTICIPANTS: Elderly inpatients aged 65 years or older, discharged from acute care 
      and post-acute care rehabilitation hospitals to home. TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS: The 
      review focused on the six keys components of Naylor's Transitional Care Model: early 
      geriatric assessment, discharge preparation, patient or caregiver's participation, 
      continuity of care, day of discharge assessment and post-discharge follow-up. TYPES 
      OF STUDIES: This review considered randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, 
      quasi-experimental studies, before and after studies, prospective and retrospective 
      cohort studies, case-control studies and analytical cross-sectional studies. 
      OUTCOMES: The outcomes for this review were functional ability, symptoms management, 
      adverse outcomes, unmet needs after discharge, coping with disease, health-related 
      quality of life (QoL), satisfaction with care, readmission rate and healthcare 
      utilization. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic search was undertaken across 13 databases 
      to retrieve published and unpublished studies in English between 2000 and 2015. 
      METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Critical appraisal was undertaken by two independent 
      reviewers using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs 
      Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument 
      (JBI-MAStARI). DATA EXTRACTION: Quantitative data were extracted from included 
      studies independently by the two reviewers using the standardized data extraction 
      tool from JBI-MAStARI. DATA SYNTHESIS: Due to the wide range of outcome measures, a 
      comprehensive meta-analysis for all studies was not possible. However, meta-analysis 
      was conducted for specific outcome measures, such as readmission, length of stay and 
      QoL. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the 
      review. Two out of the 13 studies were pilot studies and one had a pre-post design. 
      Included studies involved a total of 3964 participants with a median age of 77 
      years. Nurse discharge planning did not significantly reduce hospital readmission 
      rate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 0.53-1.01, P = 0.06). 
      The overall effect score for length of stay was significant (weighted mean 
      difference = 0.29, P < 0.01), suggesting that discharge planning increased the 
      length of hospitalization. The effectiveness of discharge planning did not 
      significantly impact QoL (mental OR = 0.37, P = 0.19 and physical OR = 0.47, P = 
      0.15). CONCLUSION: Findings of this review suggest that nursing discharge planning 
      for elderly inpatients discharged home increases length of stay, yet neither reduces 
      readmission rates nor improves QoL.

TI  - The Burden of Care for Children With Unilateral Cleft Lip: A Systematic Review of 
      Revision Surgery.
PG  - 84-94
LID - 10.1597/14-202 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the average rate of revision surgery following cleft lip 
      repair. DESIGN: PubMed, CINAHL, and SCOPUS were searched from database inception 
      through March 2013 using the search terms cleft lip and surgery. Two investigators 
      independently screened all abstracts and determined eligibility from review of full 
      manuscripts using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Strengths and 
      limitation of the studies were assessed, followed by qualitative synthesis. The I(2) 
      test of homogeneity was performed to determine if meta-analysis was appropriate. 
      RESULTS: The search identified 3034 articles. Of those, 45 met the inclusion 
      criteria. Studies were primarily case series and retrospective cohort studies, with 
      only one randomized controlled trial. One-third of studies (n = 15) did not describe 
      how the study sample was selected. Follow-up duration was not reported in one-fourth 
      of studies (n = 11). Nasolabial aesthetics were reported in 44% of studies (n = 20). 
      The incidence of revision surgery ranged from 0% to 100%. Meta-analysis was 
      precluded because of study heterogeneity (I(2) = 97%). CONCLUSIONS: The average 
      incidence of cleft lip revision surgery cannot be estimated from the published 
      literature, due to significant heterogeneity among existing reports and limited 
      study quality. To provide valid information about the burden of care for unilateral 
      cleft lip, a population-based or multicenter longitudinal cohort study is necessary; 
      this study should measure the number of surgical procedures and the patient's 
      aesthetic outcomes.

TI  - Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell therapy for nonischaemic dilated 
      cardiomyopathy-A meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1111/eci.12894 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The therapeutic effects of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) 
      transplantation in patients with nonischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are still 
      under debate. Current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported conflicting 
      results. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of BMMNCs transplantation 
      on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with nonischaemic DCM. 
      METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Controlled Trials 
      Register was performed. We included RCTs reporting data on LVEF in patients with 
      nonischaemic DCM after BMMNCs transplantation. RESULTS: Seven RCTs including 463 
      patients were included. BMMNCs transplantation significantly improved LVEF by 3.79% 
      (95% CI: 0.56%-7.03%; P = .007) and LVESV by -24.36 mL (95% CI: -46.36 to -2.36 mL; 
      P = .03), while had no impact on the risk of all-cause death (OR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.41 
      to 2.08%; P = .84). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a more significant improvement of 
      LVEF in patients with longer follow-up (~15 months to 5 years) than shorter ones (12 
      months). Moreover, using bone marrow mononuclear cells was more effective than using 
      G-CSF-stimulated bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cells in the improvement of LVEF 
      in patients with nonischaemic DCM. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow-derived mononuclear 
      cells transplantation is associated with a moderate, but significant, improvement in 
      LVEF in patients with nonischaemic DCM. This meta-analysis supports further RCT 
      conductions using BMMNCs transplantation with larger patient's population and longer 
      term follow-up.

TI  - Cost Effectiveness of Exenatide Once Weekly Versus Insulin Glargine and Liraglutide 
      for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Greece.
PG  - 67-77
LID - 10.1007/s40261-017-0586-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost 
      effectiveness of exenatide once weekly (ExQW) versus insulin glargine (IG) or 
      liraglutide 1.2 mg (Lira1.2mg) for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) 
      therapy in Greece. METHODS: The published and validated Cardiff Diabetes Model was 
      used to project clinical and economic outcomes over a patient's lifetime. Clinical 
      data were retrieved from a head-to-head clinical trial (DURATION 3) and a published 
      network meta-analysis comparing ExQW with IG or Lira1.2mg, respectively. Following a 
      Greek third-party payer perspective, direct medical costs related to drug 
      acquisition, consumables, developed micro- and macrovascular complications, 
      maintenance treatment, as well as treatment-related adverse events were considered. 
      Cost and utility data were extracted from literature and publicly available official 
      sources and assigned to model parameters to calculate total quality-adjusted 
      life-years (QALYs) and total costs as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
      (ICERs). Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of changes in input data. RESULTS: 
      Over a patient's lifetime, ExQW was associated with 0.458 or 0.039 incremental QALYs 
      compared with IG or Lira1.2mg, respectively, at additional costs of €2061 or €110, 
      respectively. The ICER for ExQW was €4499/QALY compared with IG and €2827/QALY 
      compared with Lira1.2mg. Results were robust across various one-way and scenario 
      analyses. At the defined willingness-to-pay threshold of €36,000/QALY, probabilistic 
      sensitivity analysis showed that ExQW had a 100 or 88.2% probability of being cost 
      effective relative to IG or Lira1.2mg, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ExQW was estimated 
      to be cost effective relative to IG or Lira1.2mg for the treatment of T2DM in adults 
      not adequately controlled on OAD therapy in Greece.

TI  - Assessment of Intervention Fidelity and Recommendations for Researchers Conducting 
      Studies on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Cough in the Adult: CHEST 
      Guideline and Expert Panel Report.
PG  - 32-54
LID - S0012-3692(15)50019-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1378/chest.15-0164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Successful management of chronic cough has varied in the primary 
      research studies in the reported literature. One of the potential reasons relates to 
      a lack of intervention fidelity to the core elements of the diagnostic and/or 
      therapeutic interventions that were meant to be used by the investigators. METHODS: 
      We conducted a systematic review to summarize the evidence supporting intervention 
      fidelity as an important methodologic consideration in assessing the effectiveness 
      of clinical practice guidelines used for the diagnosis and management of chronic 
      cough. We developed and used a tool to assess for five areas of intervention 
      fidelity. Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
      were searched from January 1998 to May 2014. Guideline recommendations and 
      suggestions for those conducting research using guidelines or protocols to diagnose 
      and manage chronic cough in the adult were developed and voted upon using CHEST 
      Organization methodology. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies (17 uncontrolled 
      prospective observational, two randomized controlled, and four retrospective 
      observational) met our inclusion criteria. These articles included 3,636 patients. 
      Data could not be pooled for meta-analysis because of heterogeneity. Findings 
      related to the five areas of intervention fidelity included three areas primarily 
      related to the provider and two primarily related to the patients. In the area of 
      study design, 11 of 23 studies appeared to be underpinned by a single 
      guideline/protocol; for training of providers, two of 23 studies reported training, 
      and zero of 23 reported the use of an intervention manual; and for the area of 
      delivery of treatment, when assessing the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux 
      disease, three of 23 studies appeared consistent with the most recent 
      guideline/protocol referenced by the authors. For receipt of treatment, zero of 23 
      studies mentioned measuring concordance of patient-interventionist understanding of 
      the treatment recommended, and zero of 23 mentioned measuring enactment of 
      treatment, with three of 23 measuring side effects and two of 23 measuring 
      adherence. The overall average intervention fidelity score for all 23 studies was 
      poor (20.74 out of 48). CONCLUSIONS: Only low-quality evidence supports that 
      intervention fidelity strategies were used when conducting primary research in 
      diagnosing and managing chronic cough in adults. This supports the contention that 
      some of the variability in the reporting of patients with unexplained or unresolved 
      chronic cough may be due to lack of intervention fidelity. By following the 
      recommendations and suggestions in this article, researchers will likely be better 
      able to incorporate strategies to address intervention fidelity, thereby 
      strengthening the validity and generalizability of their results that provide the 
      basis for the development of trustworthy guidelines.

      treatment for coronary artery disease, and dual antiplatelet therapy(DAPT) remains 
      the gold standard strategy to prevent ischemic events. However, the optimal duration 
      of DAPT after DES implantation remains controversial. Therefore, we aimed to 
      evaluate the best duration of DAPT following DES implantation. Method: We searched 
      PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov for all randomized clinical 
      trials(RCTs) that compared different durations of DAPT after DES implantation. Major 
      adverse cardiac events(MACE) and major bleeding were the primary and secondary 
      outcomes, respectively. Results: We included 16 RCTs (n = 42,993). The mean age of 
      included patients was 63.1 ± 10.1. The primary outcome was statistically significant 
      for lower MACE in patients who received DAPT for 24-48 months (mo) following DES 
      when compared with those who received 3-6 mo of DAPT (odds ratio [OR] 0.75; 95% 
      credible interval [CI] 0.58-0.97). There was nonstatistically significant difference 
      in MACE when comparing those who received 12 mo of DAPT to those taking either 
      3-6 mo of DAPT (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.69-1.08) or 24-48 mo of DAPT (OR 0.87; 95% CI 
      0.72-1.05). In contrast, major bleeding was significantly lower in those who 
      received 3-6 mo of DAPT (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.17-0.54) and 12 mo of DAPT (OR 0.43; 95% 
      CI 0.27-0.63) than in those who received 24-48 mo of DAPT. Conclusion: In patients 
      who undergo DES implantation, a longer duration of DAPT is associated with lower 
      MACE, despite the increased risk of major bleeding events. Therefore, 
      individualizing the duration of DAPT after DES according to the patient's risk of 
      bleeding and recurrent ischemia is recommended.

TI  - Antipsychotics for treatment of delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients.
PG  - CD005594

LID - CD005594
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines suggest limited and cautious use of antipsychotics for 
      treatment of delirium where nonpharmacological interventions have failed and 
      symptoms remain distressing or dangerous, or both. It is unclear how well these 
      recommendations are supported by current evidence. OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective 
      was to assess the efficacy of antipsychotics versus nonantipsychotics or placebo on 
      the duration of delirium in hospitalised adults. Our secondary objectives were to 
      compare the efficacy of: 1) antipsychotics versus nonantipsychotics or placebo on 
      delirium severity and resolution, mortality, hospital length of stay, discharge 
      disposition, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects; and 2) atypical 
      vs. typical antipsychotics for reducing delirium duration, severity, and resolution, 
      hospital mortality and length of stay, discharge disposition, health-related quality 
      of life, and adverse effects. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane 
      EBM Reviews, CINAHL, Thomson Reuters Web of Science and the Latin American and 
      Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) from their respective inception dates 
      until July 2017. We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects 
      (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database, Web of Science ISI Proceedings, and 
      other grey literature. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and 
      quasi-randomised trials comparing 1) antipsychotics to nonantipsychotics or placebo 
      and 2) typical to atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of delirium in adult 
      hospitalised (but not critically ill) patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We 
      examined titles and abstracts of identified studies to determine eligibility. We 
      extracted data independently in duplicate. Disagreements were settled by further 
      discussion and consensus. We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals 
      (CI) as a measure of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes, and between-group 
      standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. MAIN 
      RESULTS: We included nine trials that recruited 727 participants. Four of the nine 
      trials included a comparison of an antipsychotic to a nonantipsychotic drug or 
      placebo and seven included a comparison of a typical to an atypical antipsychotic. 
      The study populations included hospitalised medical, surgical, and palliative 
      patients.No trial reported on duration of delirium. Antipsychotic treatment did not 
      reduce delirium severity compared to nonantipsychotic drugs (standard mean 
      difference (SMD) -1.08, 95% CI -2.55 to 0.39; four studies; 494 participants; very 
      low-quality evidence); nor was there a difference between typical and atypical 
      antipsychotics (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.02; seven studies; 542 participants; 
      low-quality evidence). There was no evidence antipsychotics resolved delirium 
      symptoms compared to nonantipsychotic drug regimens (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.98; 
      three studies; 247 participants; very low-quality evidence); nor was there a 
      difference between typical and atypical antipsychotics (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79 to 
      1.52; five studies; 349 participants; low-quality evidence). The pooled results 
      indicated that antipsychotics did not alter mortality compared to nonantipsychotic 
      regimens (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.27; three studies; 319 participants; low-quality 
      evidence) nor was there a difference between typical and atypical antipsychotics (RR 
      1.71, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.35; four studies; 342 participants; low-quality evidence).No 
      trial reported on hospital length of stay, hospital discharge disposition, or 
      health-related quality of life. Adverse event reporting was limited and measured 
      with inconsistent methods; in those reporting events, the number of events were low. 
      No trial reported on physical restraint use, long-term cognitive outcomes, 
      cerebrovascular events, or QTc prolongation (i.e. increased time in the heart's 
      electrical cycle). Only one trial reported on arrhythmias and seizures, with no 
      difference between typical or atypical antipsychotics. We found antipsychotics did 
      not have a higher risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) compared to nonantipsychotic 
      drugs (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.04 to 65.57; three studies; 247 participants; very-low 
      quality evidence); pooled results showed no increased risk of EPS with typical 
      antipsychotics compared to atypical antipsychotics (RR 12.16, 95% CI 0.55 to 269.52; 
      two studies; 198 participants; very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: 
      There were no reported data to determine whether antipsychotics altered the duration 
      of delirium, length of hospital stay, discharge disposition, or health-related 
      quality of life as studies did not report on these outcomes. From the poor quality 
      data available, we found antipsychotics did not reduce delirium severity, resolve 
      symptoms, or alter mortality. Adverse effects were poorly or rarely reported in the 
      trials. Extrapyramidal symptoms were not more frequent with antipsychotics compared 
      to nonantipsychotic drug regimens, and no different for typical compared to atypical 
      antipsychotics.

TI  - Personalizing Second-Line Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Selection: Combining Network 
      Meta-analysis, Individualized Risk, and Patient Preferences for Unified Decision 
      Support.
PG  - 239-252
LID - 10.1177/0272989X19829735 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Personalizing medical treatment often requires practitioners to compare 
      multiple treatment options, assess a patient's unique risk and benefit from each 
      option, and elicit a patient's preferences around treatment. We integrated these 3 
      considerations into a decision-modeling framework for the selection of second-line 
      glycemic therapy for type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Based on multicriteria decision 
      analysis, we developed a unified treatment decision support tool accounting for 3 
      factors: patient preferences, disease outcomes, and medication efficacy and safety 
      profiles. By standardizing and multiplying these 3 factors, we calculated the 
      ranking score for each medication. This approach was applied to determining 
      second-line glycemic therapy by integrating 1) treatment efficacy and side-effect 
      data from a network meta-analysis of 301 randomized trials ( N = 219,277), 2) 
      validated risk equations for type 2 diabetes complications, and 3) patient 
      preferences around treatment (e.g., to avoid daily glucose testing). Data from 
      participants with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey (NHANES 2003-2014, N = 1107) were used to explore variations in 
      treatment recommendations and associated quality-adjusted life-years given different 
      patient features. RESULTS: Patients at the highest microvascular disease risk had 
      glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists or basal insulin recommended as top choices, 
      whereas those wanting to avoid an injected medication or daily glucose testing had 
      sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors commonly 
      recommended, and those with major cost concerns had sulfonylureas commonly 
      recommended. By converting from the most common sulfonylurea treatment to the 
      model-recommended treatment, NHANES participants were expected to save an average of 
      0.036 quality-adjusted life-years per person (about a half month) from 10 years of 
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Models can help integrate meta-analytic treatment effect 
      estimates with individualized risk calculations and preferences, to aid personalized 
      treatment selection.

TI  - Systematic review and network meta-analysis of stroke prevention treatments in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 93-107
LID - 10.2147/CPAA.S105165 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last 4 years, four novel oral anticoagulants have been developed 
      as alternatives to warfarin and antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) patients. The objective of this review was to estimate the 
      comparative effectiveness of all antithrombotic treatments for AF patients. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data sources were Medline Ovid (1946 to October 2015), Embase 
      Ovid (1980 to October 2015), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      (CENTRAL, Issue 9, 2015). Randomized controlled trials of AF patients were selected 
      if they compared at least two of the following: placebo, aspirin, aspirin and 
      clopidogrel combination therapy, adjusted-dose warfarin (target international 
      normalized ratio 2.0-3.0), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Bayesian 
      network meta-analyses were conducted for outcomes of interest (all stroke, ischemic 
      stroke, myocardial infarction, overall mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial 
      hemorrhage). RESULTS: Based on 16 randomized controlled trials of 96,826 patients, 
      all oral anticoagulants were more effective than antiplatelet agents at reducing the 
      risk of ischemic stroke and all strokes. Compared to warfarin, dabigatran 150 mg 
      (rate ratio 0.65, 95% credible interval 0.52-0.82) and apixaban (rate ratio 0.82, 
      95% credible interval 0.69-0.97) reduced the risk of all strokes. Dabigatran 150 mg 
      was also more effective than warfarin at reducing ischemic stroke risk (rate ratio 
      0.76, 95% credible interval 0.59-0.99). Aspirin, apixaban, dabigatran 110 mg, and 
      edoxaban were associated with less major bleeding than warfarin. CONCLUSION: All 
      oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke in AF patients. Some novel oral 
      anticoagulants are associated with a lower stroke and/or major bleeding risk than 
      warfarin. In addition to the safety and effectiveness of drug therapy, as reported 
      in this study, individual treatment recommendations should also consider the 
      patient's underlying stroke and bleeding risk profile.

AB  - The use of blood derived eye drops for the treatment of ocular surface disorders has 
      become increasingly popular in recent years. The mechanism of action is the 
      stimulation of cellular proliferation and migration by supplying an active mixture 
      of growth factors and cytokines at the ocular surface, thus mimicking the function 
      of the lacking natural tears. Blood derived eye drops have been used in the last 
      decades for the treatment of a variety of ocular surface diseases, including mainly 
      dry eye disease, persistent corneal epithelial defect, corneal ulcer, ocular surface 
      burn, recurrent corneal erosion and limbal stem-cell deficiency. Among overall blood 
      derived eye drops, both autologous (from the patients themselves) and homologous 
      (from donors) products exist, with different advantages and disadvantages. 
      Autologous serum, obtained from the patient's own peripheral blood, is the first 
      introduced and most commonly used product. Despite several randomized clinical 
      trials showed its safety and efficacy, a recent Cochraine meta-analysis failed to 
      show significant results due to low evidence. Homologous sources including 
      allogeneic serum obtained from healthy donors, and umbilical cord blood serum 
      collected at the time of delivery, are efficient alternatives, especially when 
      autologous serum therapy is contraindicated or not appropriate. Platelet-derived eye 
      drops are prepared and used in various but poor standardized preparations, namely 
      platelet-rich plasma, plasma rich in growth factors, and platelet lysate. Future 
      perspectives of blood-derived products include the introduction of tailored eye 
      drops, screened for the proper content of growth factors and cytokines according to 
      each patient and ocular surface disease.

      literature.
PG  - 797-806

AB  - Introduction: Postoperative pancreatic fistula is the most troublesome complication 
      after pancreaticoduodenectomy, and is an on-going area of concern for pancreatic 
      surgeons. The specific pancreatic reconstruction technique is an important factor 
      influencing the development of postoperative pancreatic fistula after 
      pancreaticoduodenectomy. Areas covered: In this paper, we briefly introduced the 
      definition and relevant influencing factors of postoperative pancreatic fistula. We 
      performed a search of all meta-analyses published in the last 5 years and all 
      published randomized controlled trials comparing different pancreatic anastomotic 
      techniques, and we evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of different 
      techniques. Expert opinion: No individual anastomotic method can completely avoid 
      postoperative pancreatic fistula. Selecting specific techniques tailored to the 
      patient's situation intraoperatively may be key to reducing the incidence of 
      postoperative pancreatic fistula.

TI  - Cardio-toxicity in childhood cancer survivors "Cure is not enough".
PG  - S4344-S4350
LID - 10.21037/jtd.2018.11.28 [doi]
AB  - The number of pediatric cancer survivors is growing, and they are getting older. 
      Therapy-induced cardiotoxicity therefore is debated as an ongoing problem. 
      Recognition of the side effects in the use of anthracyclines and radiation as well 
      as the patients' clinical condition and comorbidities leads back as far as the 
      beginning of systematic cancer treatment in children in the 1980s. Since, numerous 
      case reports, meta-analyses and retrospective surveys were published worldwide. 
      However, randomized clinical trials with standardized protocols yet fail to be 
      designed. This article gives an overview of the recent reports and emphasizes on the 
      heterogeneity of the different approaches. A standardized work-up which may identify 
      the patient at risk-including the patient's history and condition, individual 
      genetic dispositions, dosage and method of drug application, consideration of 
      co-medication, radiation therapy and dose, standardized imaging methods-is the main 
      proposition of our report. The fusion of already established sources, e.g., data of 
      different registries or study centers, might help to create preventive strategies 
      for and a better understanding of patients with therapy induced cardiomyopathy.

TI  - Alpha-2 agonists for long-term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically 
      ill patients.
PG  - CD010269
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010269.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD010269
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sedation reduces patient levels of anxiety and stress, facilitates the 
      delivery of care and ensures safety. Alpha-2 agonists have a range of effects 
      including sedation, analgesia and antianxiety. They sedate, but allow staff to 
      interact with patients and do not suppress respiration. They are attractive 
      alternatives for long-term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill 
      patients. OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of alpha-2 agonists for 
      sedation of more than 24 hours, compared with traditional sedatives, in 
      mechanically-ventilated critically ill patients. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 10, 2014), MEDLINE 
      (1946 to 9 October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 9 October 2014), CINAHL (1982 to 9 October 
      2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (1982 to 9 October 
      2014), ISI Web of Science (1987 to 9 October 2014), Chinese Biological Medical 
      Database (1978 to 9 October 2014) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1979 
      to 9 October 2014), the World Health Organization international clinical trials 
      registry platform (to 9 October 2014), Current Controlled Trials metaRegister of 
      controlled trials active registers (to 9 October 2014), the ClinicalTrials.gov 
      database (to 9 October 2014), the conference proceedings citation index (to 9 
      October 2014) and the reference lists of included studies and previously published 
      meta-analyses and systematic reviews for relevant studies. We imposed no language 
      restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized and quasi-randomized 
      controlled trials comparing alpha-2 agonists (clonidine or dexmedetomidine) versus 
      alternative sedatives for long-term sedation (more than 24 hours) during mechanical 
      ventilation in critically ill patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review 
      authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We contacted study 
      authors for additional information. We performed meta-analyses when more than three 
      studies were included, and selected a random-effects model due to expected clinical 
      heterogeneity. We calculated the geometric mean difference for continuous outcomes 
      and the risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes. We described the effects by values and 
      95% confidence intervals (CIs). We considered two-sided P < 0.05 to be statistically 
      significant. MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies, covering 1624 participants, met the 
      inclusion criteria. All included studies investigated adults and compared 
      dexmedetomidine with traditional sedatives, including propofol, midazolam and 
      lorazepam. Compared with traditional sedatives, dexmedetomidine reduced the 
      geometric mean duration of mechanical ventilation by 22% (95% CI 10% to 33%; four 
      studies, 1120 participants, low quality evidence), and consequently the length of 
      stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) by 14% (95% CI 1% to 24%; five studies, 1223 
      participants, very low quality evidence). There was no evidence that dexmedetomidine 
      decreased the risk of delirium (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; seven studies, 1624 
      participants, very low quality evidence) as results were consistent with both no 
      effect and appreciable benefit. Only one study assessed the risk of coma, but lacked 
      methodological reliability (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.86, very low quality 
      evidence). Of all the adverse events included, the most commonly reported one was 
      bradycardia, and we observed a doubled (111%) increase in the incidence of 
      bradycardia (RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.39 to 3.20; six studies, 1587 participants, very low 
      quality evidence). Our meta-analysis provided no evidence that dexmedetomidine had 
      any impact on mortality (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.24; six studies, 1584 
      participants, very low quality evidence). We observed high levels of heterogeneity 
      in risk of delirium (I² = 70%), but due to the limited number of studies we were 
      unable to determine the source of heterogeneity through subgroup analyses or 
      meta-regression. We judged six of the seven studies to be at high risk of bias. 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we found no eligible studies for children or 
      for clonidine. Compared with traditional sedatives, long-term sedation using 
      dexmedetomidine in critically ill adults reduced the duration of mechanical 
      ventilation and ICU length of stay. There was no evidence for a beneficial effect on 
      risk of delirium and the heterogeneity was high. The evidence for risk of coma was 
      inadequate. The most common adverse event was bradycardia. No evidence indicated 
      that dexmedetomidine changed mortality. The general quality of evidence ranged from 
      very low to low, due to high risks of bias, serious inconsistency and imprecision, 
      and strongly suspected publication bias. Future studies could pay more attention to 
      children and to using clonidine

TI  - Acute Cholecystitis.
PG  - 163-5
LID - 10.1159/000431275 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of acute cholecystitis has been controversially discussed 
      in the literature as there are no high-evidence-level data yet for determining the 
      optimal point in time for surgical intervention. So far, the laparoscopic removal of 
      the gallbladder within 72 h has been the most preferred approach in acute 
      cholecystitis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review by including randomized 
      trials of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. RESULTS: Based 
      on a few prospective studies and two meta-analyses, there was consent to prefer an 
      early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients suffering from acute calculous 
      cholecystitis while the term 'early' has not been consistently defined yet. So far, 
      there is new level 1b evidence brought forth by the so-called 'ACDC' study which has 
      convincingly shown in a prospective randomized setting that immediate laparoscopic 
      cholecystectomy - within a time frame of 24 h after hospital admission - is the 
      smartest approach in ASA I-III patients suffering from acute calculous cholecystitis 
      compared to a more conservative approach with a delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
      after an initial antibiotic treatment in terms of morbidity, length of hospital 
      stay, and overall treatment costs. Concerning critically ill patients suffering from 
      acute calculous or acalculous cholecystitis, there is no consensus in treatment due 
      to missing data in the literature. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for 
      acute cholecystitis within 24 h after hospital admission is a safe procedure and 
      should be the preferred treatment for ASA I-III patients. In critically ill 
      patients, the intervention should be determined by a narrow interdisciplinary 
      consent based on the patient's individual comorbidities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) requires at least six months of treatment. If 
      treatment is incomplete, patients may not be cured and drug resistance may develop. 
      Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) is a specific strategy, endorsed by the World Health 
      Organization, to improve adherence by requiring health workers, community volunteers 
      or family members to observe and record patients taking each dose. OBJECTIVES: To 
      evaluate DOT compared to self-administered therapy in people on treatment for active 
      TB or on prophylaxis to prevent active disease. We also compared the effects of 
      different forms of DOT. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to 13 
      January 2015: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane 
      Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS and mRCT. We also checked article reference lists 
      and contacted relevant researchers and organizations. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing DOT with routine 
      self-administration of treatment or prophylaxis at home. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias of each included 
      trial and extracted data. We compared interventions using risk ratios (RR) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI). We used a random-effects model if meta-analysis was 
      appropriate but heterogeneity present (I(2) statistic > 50%). We assessed the 
      quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials 
      including 5662 participants met the inclusion criteria. DOT was performed by a range 
      of people (nurses, community health workers, family members or former TB patients) 
      in a variety of settings (clinic, the patient's home or the home of a community 
      volunteer). DOT versus self-administered Six trials from South Africa, Thailand, 
      Taiwan, Pakistan and Australia compared DOT with self-administered therapy for 
      treatment. Trials included DOT at home by family members, community health workers 
      (who were usually supervised); DOT at home by health staff; and DOT at health 
      facilities. TB cure was low with self-administration across all studies (range 41% 
      to 67%), and direct observation did not substantially improve this (RR 1.08, 95% CI 
      0.91 to 1.27; five trials, 1645 participants, moderate quality evidence). In a 
      subgroup analysis stratified by the frequency of contact between health services in 
      the self-treatment arm, daily DOT may improve TB cure when compared to 
      self-administered treatment where patients in the self-administered group only 
      visited the clinic every month (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.25; two trials, 900 
      participants); but with contact in the control becoming more frequent, this small 
      effect was not apparent (every two weeks: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.12; one trial, 
      497 participants; every week: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.21; two trials, 248 
      participants).Treatment completion showed a similar pattern, ranging from 59% to 78% 
      in the self-treatment groups, and direct observation did not improve this (RR 1.07, 
      95% CI 0.96 to 1.19; six trials, 1839 participants, moderate quality evidence). DOT 
      at home versus DOT at health facility In four trials that compared DOT at home by 
      family members, or community health workers, with DOT by health workers at a health 
      facility there was little or no difference in cure or treatment completion (cure: RR 
      1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18, four trials, 1556 participants, moderate quality 
      evidence; treatment completion: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17, three trials, 1029 
      participants, moderate quality evidence). DOT by family member versus DOT by 
      community health workerTwo trials compared DOT at home by family members with DOT at 
      home by community health workers. There was also little or no difference in cure or 
      treatment completion (cure: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; two trials, 1493 
      participants, moderate quality evidence; completion: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22; 
      two trials, 1493 participants, low quality evidence). Specific patient categoriesA 
      trial of 300 intravenous drug users in the USA evaluated direct observation with no 
      observation in TB prophylaxis to prevent active disease and showed little difference 
      in treatment completion (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; one trial, 300 participants, 
      low quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: From the existing trials, DOT did not 
      provide a solution to poor adherence in TB treatment. Given the large resource and 
      cost implications of DOT, policy makers might want to reconsider strategies that 
      depend on direct observation. Other options might take into account financial and 
      logistical barriers to care; approaches that motivate patients and staff; and 
      defaulter follow-up.

COIS- As a result of the earlier editions of this review from the mid 1990s, PG has become 
      recognised and associated with the continued debate about whether DOT should be 
      central to national programmes in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

AB  - Multiple randomized trials, as well as a meta-analysis of these studies, have 
      confirmed the equivalence of breast-conservation and mastectomy. In addition, in 
      unselected populations, adjuvant radiation therapy following lumpectomy has been 
      shown to decrease in-breast recurrence and improve overall survival. However, 
      radiation has morbidity, and is costly and inconvenient. Multiple efforts to 
      minimize treatment have been studied, including omitting radiation in low-risk 
      populations, as well as in those with significant competing risks. Central to these 
      efforts has been an increased awareness of the inherent biology, allowing treatment 
      to be more precisely tailored to the risks posed by each individual patient's 
      disease. In addition, an improved understanding of the radio-responsiveness of both 
      tumor and adjacent normal tissue has permitted safe use of short-course 
      (hypofractionated) radiation. Studies are ongoing to determine the most appropriate 
      candidates for both hypofractionated treatment and omission of radiation entirely. 
      The optimal management of ductal carcinoma in situ is also a subject of intense 
      study. Multiple trials have attempted to identify patients who can safely forego 
      radiation and, more recently, molecular predictors of recurrence have been developed 
      to further fine-tune this low-risk population.

TI  - Precision Medicine and the Practice of Trichiatry: Adapting the Concept.
PG  - 338-343
LID - 10.1159/000500364 [doi]
AB  - Evidence-based medicine (EBM) aims for the ideal that healthcare professionals make 
      conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of the best available evidence gained 
      from the scientific method to clinical decision-making. It seeks to assess the 
      strength of the evidence for benefits of diagnostic tests and treatments, using 
      techniques from science, engineering, and statistics, such as the systematic review 
      of medical literature, meta-analysis, risk-benefit analysis, and randomized 
      controlled trials. The limited success rate of EBM therapies suggests that the 
      complex nature of hair loss may be inadequately served by the present levels of 
      evidence, and that physicians treating hair loss may have fallen short of adequately 
      researching a robust evidence to underpin their practices. Against this backdrop, 
      the concept of precision medicine (PM) is evolving. PM refers to the customization 
      of medical care to the patient's individual characteristics based on the patient's 
      genetic background and other molecular or cellular analysis, while classifying 
      patients into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular 
      medical condition, in the biology or prognosis of those medical conditions, or in 
      their response to a specific treatment. With the advances in hair research, the 
      powerful tools of molecular biology and genetics, and innovative technologies, we 
      have the robust scientific data and tools to adapt the concept of PM to the practice 
      of trichiatry. Finally, databases pertaining to the development and efficacy of PM 
      must be analyzed and be used to form the basis of evidence-based personalized 
      trichiatry.

TI  - Evolution and revolution of laparoscopic liver resection in Japan.
PG  - 33-43
LID - 10.1002/ags3.12000 [doi]
AB  - Due to important technological developments and improved endoscopic techniques, 
      laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) is now considered the approach of choice and is 
      increasingly performed worldwide. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of 
      observational data reported that LLR was associated with less bleeding, fewer 
      complications, and no oncological disadvantage; however, no prospective randomized 
      trials have been conducted. LLR will continue to evolve as a surgical approach that 
      improves patient's quality of life. LLR will not totally supplant open liver 
      surgery, and major LLR remains to be technically challenging procedure. The success 
      of LLR depends on individual learning curves and adherence to surgical indications. 
      A recent study proposed a scoring system for stepwise application of LLR, which was 
      based on experience at high-volume Japanese centers. A cluster of deaths after major 
      LLR was sensationally reported by the Japanese media in 2014. In response, the 
      Japanese Society of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery conducted emergency data 
      collection on operative mortality. The results demonstrated that mortality was not 
      higher than that for open procedures except for hemi-hepatectomy with biliary 
      reconstruction. An online prospective registry system for LLR was established in 
      2015 to be transparent for patients who might potentially undergo treatment with 
      this newly developed, technically demanding surgical procedure.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adductor spasmodic dysphonia is an extremely disabling voice disorder 
      that negatively impacts a patient's quality of life (QOL). We performed a systematic 
      review to determine if Botulinum Toxin (BT) injections improved voice related QOL in 
      patients with this disorder. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane 
      Library, ProQuest, and Scopus from 2000, to and including November 1st, 2018, were 
      searched. We identified randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, and 
      observational studies of the effects of BT injections on the QOL in patients with 
      adductor spasmodic dysphonia. The two authors, separately and individually chose the 
      studies based on inclusion criteria, assessed study quality, and relevant extracted 
      data. RESULTS: Nine studies used the Voice Handicap Index (VHI). The results showed 
      significant changes pre- to post-BT injection (SMD = -0.357; 95% CI: -0.579, -0.136; 
      z = 3.16; P = 0.002; I-squared = 0.000%). Five studies used the Voice-Related QOL; 
      their results also showed a significant improvement pre- to postinjection (SMD = 
      -2.99; 95% CI: -3.27, -1.32; z = 4.61; P < 0.001; I-squared = 87%). Three other 
      studies used other, shortened versions of the VHI, VHI-10. They also showed 
      significant results (SMD = -0.145; 95% CI: -0.349, 0.06; z = 1.38; P = 0.17; 
      I-squared = 0.000). CONCLUSION: BT injections positively affect patients' QOL. 
      However, patients' QOL scores may never be normalized, in line with perceptual voice 
      quality and acoustic parameters.

TI  - Quality of life following ostomy reversal with purse-string vs linear skin closure: 
      a systematic review.
PG  - 209-216
LID - 10.1007/s00384-018-3219-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of the defunctioning stoma on minimizing anastomotic leak 
      in colorectal surgery is well established. However, a defunctioning stoma can 
      substantially impact on quality of life (QoL). Circumferential purse-string 
      approximation (PSA) and linear skin closure (LSC) are the most commonly performed 
      surgical technique for reversal of stoma. The aim of this review was to systemically 
      review and meta-analyze available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PSA 
      and LSC. METHODS: An electronic systematic search using MEDLINE databases (PubMed, 
      EMBASE, and Web of Science) of RCTs comparing PSA and LSC was performed. Eight RCTs 
      totalling 647 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this 
      meta-analysis. RESULTS: Patient's satisfaction is significantly lower in PSA group 
      during the first postoperative week, but it sharply improves afterwards and no 
      difference were noted at 1 and 6 months between the two groups. Relative risk (RR) 
      of developing a SSI is significantly lower in PSA compared to LSC group (RR 0.16 95% 
      CI 0.09; 0.30; p = 0.0001), whereas incisional hernia (RR 0.53 95% CI 0.08; 3.53; 
      p = 0.512), operative time (MD - 0.06 95% CI - 0.30; 0.17; p = 0.593), and hospital 
      stay (MD - 0.09 (95% CI - 0.29-0.11; p = 0.401) remain similar. DISCUSSION: QoL was 
      similar in both patients groups after the first postoperative week. PSA 
      significantly reduced SSI rate. No difference was observed in incisional hernia 
      rate, operative time, or length of hospital stay.

AB  - PURPOSE: Multiple regimens of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy have been 
      used in the past in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 
      Later trials of PCI stenting demonstrated the efficacy of dual-antiplatelet therapy 
      (DAPT) in reducing stent- and non-stent-related thrombotic events in this specific 
      population. Nonetheless, the required duration of DAPT has not yet been elucidated. 
      In this article we sought to identify various randomized clinical trials (RCTs), 
      pooled analyses, meta-analyses, and data pertaining to the optimal duration of DAPT 
      and attempt some recommendations based on patients' clinical and procedural 
      profiles. METHODS: We performed an extensive search using MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane 
      Library, and Internet sources for abstracts, manuscripts, and conference reports 
      without any language or date restrictions. In our review we included all available 
      evidence from RCTs, meta-analyses, observational studies, and abstracts pertaining 
      to our topic. Search results that were deemed irrelevant or that would not serve the 
      goal or topic of our review were excluded. RESULTS: Our search yielded 10 RCTs 
      directly comparing different durations of DAPT, 3 meta-analyses amassing the 
      evidence resulting from randomized data, and numerous observational studies that 
      served the aim of our review. The observational studies included in the manuscript 
      are directly related to instances in which RCTs could not be performed or introduce 
      important concepts related to the duration of DAPT. IMPLICATIONS: There is no 
      conclusive evidence that determines the mandatory DAPT duration after PCI. In 
      addition, there are distinct patient populations that need specific treatment 
      regimens, such as diabetic patients or those on long-term oral anticoagulation. 
      Therefore, clinical judgement and meticulous examination of all pertaining risk 
      factors are required for each individual. These factors include those related to a 
      patient's characteristics, treatment procedures, lesion complexity, and stent type. 
      Currently ongoing studies are anticipated to further elucidate and integrate our 
      understanding with regard to DAPT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity in 
      developed countries and an important cause of morbidity and mortality in developing 
      countries. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are very important. OBJECTIVE: 
      To provide an update on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of 
      community-acquired pneumonia in children. METHODS: A PubMed search was completed in 
      Clinical Queries using the key term "communityacquired pneumonia". The search 
      strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, 
      observational studies, and reviews. Patents were searched using the key term 
      "community-acquired pneumonia" from www.google.com/patents, http://espacenet.com, 
      and www. freepatentsonline.com. RESULTS: Generally, viruses, notably respiratory 
      syncytial virus, are the most common cause of community- acquired pneumonia in 
      children younger than 5 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial 
      cause across all age groups. Other important bacterial causes in children younger 
      than 5 years include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus 
      aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In children 5 years or older, in addition to S. 
      pneumoniae, other important bacterial causes include Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 
      Chlamydophila pneumonia. In the majority of cases, bacterial and viral pneumonia 
      cannot be reliably distinguished from each other on clinical grounds. In practice, 
      most children with pneumonia are treated empirically with antibiotics; the choice of 
      which depends on the patient's age and most likely pathogen. Recent patents related 
      to the management of community-acquired pneumonia are discussed. CONCLUSION: In 
      previously healthy children under the age of 5 years, high dose amoxicillin is the 
      treatment of choice. For those with type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, 
      clindamycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin are reasonable 
      alternatives. For children with a non-type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, 
      cephalosporins such as cefixime, cefprozil, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, and cefuroxime 
      should be considered. In previously healthy children over the age of 5 years, 
      macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin are the drugs of choice.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides a systematic, evidence-based approach to 
      acute medication choices for the patient with migraine. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent 
      clinical trials, meta-analyses, and practice guidelines have confirmed that four 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with randomized controlled trial 
      evidence for efficacy in migraine (ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, diclofenac potassium, 
      and acetylsalicylic acid) and seven triptans (sumatriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, 
      zolmitriptan, almotriptan, frovatriptan, and naratriptan) are appropriate 
      medications for acute migraine treatment. Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is also suitable 
      for selected patients. SUMMARY: NSAIDs and triptans are the mainstays of acute 
      migraine therapy, and antiemetic drugs can be added as necessary. Opioids and 
      combination analgesics containing opioids should not be used routinely. 
      Patient-specific clinical features should help guide the selection of an acute 
      medication for an individual patient. Acute medications can be organized into four 
      treatment strategies for use in various clinical settings. The acetaminophen-NSAID 
      strategy is suitable for patients with attacks of mild to moderate severity. The 
      triptan strategy is suitable for patients with severe attacks and for those with 
      attacks of moderate severity who do not respond well to NSAIDs. The refractory 
      migraine strategies may be useful for patients who do not respond well to the NSAIDs 
      or triptans alone and include using triptans and NSAIDs simultaneously in 
      combination, DHE, and rescue medications (eg, dopamine antagonists, combination 
      analgesics, and corticosteroids) when the patient's usual medications fail. 
      Strategies for patients with contraindications to vasoconstricting drugs include use 
      of NSAIDs, combination analgesics, and dopamine antagonists.Acetaminophen is the 
      safest acute migraine drug during pregnancy, and acetaminophen with codeine is also 
      an option. Sumatriptan may be an option during pregnancy for selected patients and 
      is compatible with breast-feeding.

TI  - Impact of tofacitinib on patient outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis - review of 
      clinical studies.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.2147/PROM.S62879 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, progressive autoimmune disease associated with 
      inflammation and destruction of joints and systemic effects, which result in 
      significant impact on patient's quality of life and function. Tofacitinib was 
      approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the USA in 2012 and 
      subsequently in other countries, but not by the European Medicines Agency. The goal 
      of this review was to evaluate the impact of tofacitinib on patient-reported and 
      patient-specific outcomes from prior clinical studies, focusing on quality of life, 
      functionality, pain, global disease assessment, major adverse consequences, and 
      withdrawals. A total of 13 reports representing 11 clinical studies on tofacitinib 
      in rheumatoid arthritis were identified through PubMed and reference lists in 
      meta-analyses and other reviews. Data on improvements in patient-driven composite 
      tools to measure disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis, such as the Health 
      Assessment Questionnaire, served as a major outcome evaluated in this review and 
      were extracted from each study. Additional data extracted from those clinical 
      studies included patient assessment of pain (using a 0-100 mm visual analog scale), 
      patient global assessment of disease (using a 0-100 mm visual analog scale), patient 
      withdrawals, withdrawals due to adverse effects or lack of effect, and risk of 
      serious adverse effects, serious infections, and deaths. Tofacitinib 5 mg bid 
      appears to have a favorable impact on patient outcomes related to efficacy and 
      safety when compared with baseline values and with comparator disease-modifying 
      antirheumatic drugs and placebo. Improvements were seen in the composite and 
      individual measures of disease activity. Serious adverse effects, other adverse 
      consequences, overall withdrawals, and withdrawals due to adverse effects and lack 
      of efficacy are similar or more favorable for tofacitinib versus comparator 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and placebo. At this point, tofacitinib 
      appears to have an important role in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis through 
      improvement in these patient outcomes. However, it may require years of additional 
      clinical studies and postmarketing surveillance to fully characterize the 
      benefit-to-risk ratio of tofacitinib in a larger and diverse patient population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare pregnancy outcomes in hydrosalpinx (HX) patients 
      treated by Essure, laparoscopic salpingectomy, and proximal tubal occlusion (LPTO) 
      before IVF. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: 
      University-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENT(S): Women undergoing Essure, 
      laparoscopic salpingectomy, and LPTO for HX before IVF. INTERVENTION(S): The overall 
      combined risk estimates were calculated by means of fixed- or random-effects models. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and live birth rate (LBR). 
      RESULT(S): In total, 3,065 patients were included in 33 studies. Thirteen of them 
      were comparative studies among 3 surgical methods and no intervention. In the 
      analysis of comparative studies, there were no significant differences in 
      implantation rate (IR), CPR, and ongoing pregnancy rate/LBR between salpingectomy 
      and LPTO groups. The CPR, IR, and LBR of Essure were significantly lower than those 
      of the laparoscopic surgery (salpingectomy and LPTO) group, with a CPR of 34.1% vs. 
      44.0% (relative risk [RR] 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.51, 0.98]), an IR of 
      17.3% vs. 38.0% (RR 0.45; 95% CI [0.27, 0.74]), and an LBR of 22.2% vs. 37.4% (RR 
      0.57; 95% CI [0.35, 0.91]). CONCLUSION(S): Management of HX by laparoscopic 
      salpingectomy and LPTO yielded the same effect on the improvement of the pregnancy 
      outcome after IVF. The hysteroscopic placement of Essure devices to treat HX before 
      IVF produces inferior pregnancy outcomes compared with those following the 
      laparoscopic approach. More multicenter randomized, controlled trials are warranted 
      in future research to further examine the conclusion from this meta-analysis.

TI  - Baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to predict the extent of cardiovascular 
      benefit from lipid-lowering therapies: a review.
PG  - 47-54
LID - 10.1093/ehjcvp/pvy038 [doi]
AB  - Lipid-lowering therapies have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcome in a wide 
      range of patients. The current guidelines recommend a graded approach to reduction 
      in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) proportional to the patient's risk, 
      with the goal of achieving either a certain magnitude of reduction or a specific 
      threshold of final LDL-C. Recent findings from a meta-analysis of numerous 
      randomized trials suggest that more attention should be given to the baseline LDL-C 
      of an individual patient. In this review, we discuss how the baseline LDL-C level 
      may provide a means to better understand the results of recent cardiovascular 
      outcome trials and the expected benefits of lipid-lowering therapies. The exact 
      quantification of the clinical benefit associate with an intensified lipid-lowering 
      therapy depends on the baseline LDL-C. Mortality is reduced in a log-linear fashion 
      only when LDL-C > 100 mg/dL.

TI  - A comparison of general versus regional anesthesia for hip fracture surgery: a 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 20295-301
AB  - In this study, we aimed to compare the effect of general versus regional anesthesia 
      on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing surgical repair of hip fracture. 
      Randomized controlled trials, prospective studies and retrospective observational 
      studies were searched in PubMed, Medline and Embase database published between 
      January 2005 and March 2014. The overall outcome was measured by odds ratios (ORs) 
      and risk ratios (RRs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A 
      total of 7 trials, involving 36448 patients received general anesthesia and 33952 
      patients received regional anesthesia, were included in present meta-analysis. We 
      found that the 30-day mortality rate was lower in general anesthesia cases than that 
      in regional cases (5.3% vs. 6.3%). Overall, our results demonstrated that there was 
      no significant difference in 30-day mortality between two types of anesthesia in 
      patients with hip fracture surgery (RR=0.98, 95% CI=0.92-1.04, P=0.48), indicating 
      that types of anesthesia might not be a risk factor for hip fracture surgery. No 
      statistically significant difference was observed in other outcome measures 
      (P>0.05). In conclusion, our results suggested that the choice of anesthesia 
      (general or regional) should be made by the anesthesiologist on an individual basis 
      and based on the patient's medical conditions. Further research is still needed to 
      evaluate the effect of these two anesthesia methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects up to 30% of 
      adults in Western populations and is increasing in prevalence. GERD is associated 
      with lifestyle factors, particularly obesity and tobacco smoking, which also 
      threatens the patient's general health. GERD carries the risk of several adverse 
      outcomes and there is widespread use of potent acid-inhibitors, which are associated 
      with long-term adverse effects. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the 
      role of lifestyle intervention in the treatment of GERD. METHODS: Literature 
      searches were performed in PubMed (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1980), and the Cochrane 
      Library (no start date) to October 1, 2014. Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, 
      randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and prospective observational studies were 
      included. RESULTS: Weight loss was followed by decreased time with esophageal acid 
      exposure in 2 RCTs (from 5.6% to 3.7% and from 8.0% to 5.5%), and reduced reflux 
      symptoms in prospective observational studies. Tobacco smoking cessation reduced 
      reflux symptoms in normal-weight individuals in a large prospective cohort study 
      (odds ratio, 5.67). In RCTs, late evening meals increased time with supine acid 
      exposure compared with early meals (5.2% point change), and head-of-the-bed 
      elevation decreased time with supine acid exposure compared with a flat position 
      (from 21% to 15%). CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss and tobacco smoking cessation should be 
      recommended to GERD patients who are obese and smoke, respectively. Avoiding late 
      evening meals and head-of-the-bed elevation is effective in nocturnal GERD.

BTI - Screening for Cervical Cancer With High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Testing: A 
      Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Cervical cancer can be prevented with early detection and treatment of 
      precancerous lesions that are caused primarily by infection with high-risk strains 
      of human papillomavirus (hrHPV). Current guidelines for screening in the United 
      States focus on cytology screening with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, with hrHPV 
      cotesting as an option for women ages 30 to 65 years that allows for longer 
      rescreening intervals. Evidence from large trials evaluating screening programs 
      involving primary hrHPV testing (hrHPV alone as the initial test) and cotesting may 
      inform new screening strategies. Evidence supporting cytology screening is well 
      established, so this review evaluated screening with hrHPV testing alone (i.e., 
      primary hrHPV testing) or as cotesting with cytology compared to cytology alone to 
      address whether these forms of screening provide better protection from cervical 
      cancer and allow for longer rescreening intervals. Rates of cervical cancer are very 
      low among routinely screened women in the United States, but not all women are 
      routinely screened, and there are significant racial/ethnic disparities in morbidity 
      and mortality from cervical cancer. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the benefits 
      and harms of screening for cervical cancer using hrHPV testing as the screening 
      strategy (with or without cytology). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed, PsychINFO, and 
      Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, and the Education Resources 
      Information Center from January 2011 through February 15, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: 
      English-language trials of benefits or harms of screening for cervical cancer using 
      hrHPV testing as the screening strategy (with or without cytology) in women age 21 
      years or older. Cohort studies were also considered for inclusion to evaluate harms 
      and screening performance in large, representative primary care populations and in 
      underscreened women. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently 
      reviewed abstracts and full-text articles, and then extracted data from fair- and 
      good-quality trials and cohort studies. Results were qualitatively synthesized. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cervical cancer mortality, invasive cervical cancer (ICC) 
      incidence, early detection of disease (i.e., cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 
      [CIN] 3+), rates of false-positive and false-negative screening, colposcopy and 
      biopsy rates, quality of life and other harms. RESULTS: We included eight 
      randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) (n=410,556), five cohort studies (n=402,609), 
      and one individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis (n=176,464). Trials were 
      heterogeneous with regard to type of cytology (conventional vs. liquid-based 
      cytology), type of hrHPV test (DNA PCR enzyme immunoassay vs. Hybrid Capture 2), 
      screening interval (2 to 5 years), followup protocols for abnormal results, number 
      of screening rounds (1 or 2), and consistency of screening protocols between rounds. 
      Two fair-quality trials and one good-quality trial evaluated primary hrHPV screening 
      (hrHPV testing alone) compared with cytology alone; two good- and two fair-quality 
      trials compared hrHPV cotesting with cytology alone. The evidence was generally 
      consistent across four trials with variable protocols and hrHPV test types 
      demonstrating that primary hrHPV testing increased detection of CIN3+ in the initial 
      round of screening (relative risk [RR] range, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.09 to 2.37] to 7.46 
      [95% CI, 1.02 to 54.66]). Only one trial of primary hrHPV testing, where all women 
      with a positive hrHPV test were referred to colposcopy, had complete results from 
      two rounds of screening (at Round 2 screening all women received cytology testing). 
      In that study, CIN3+ detection in Round 1 was 3-fold higher in the hrHPV testing 
      group. In the second screening round, CIN3+ detection was significantly lower among 
      women in the intervention group (RR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.58]), and cumulative 
      detection over both screening rounds was 1.8-fold higher. Results of a large, 
      single-arm, fair-quality cohort study of primary hrHPV testing at 3-year intervals 
      were consistent with trial findings: CIN3+ detection in the second screening round 
      was significantly lower compared to the first round (RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.06 to 
      0.32]). Among four trials of hrHPV cotesting, the first round CIN3+ detection was 
      higher in the intervention group in two trials (though not significant) and equal in 
      two trials. Cumulative CIN3+ detection over two rounds of screening ranged from 0.3 
      to 1.6 percent across studies. The relative risk for cumulative CIN3+ detection 
      ranged from 0.91 to 1.13; none were significantly different from one. Long-term 
      followup (13-year) in one trial showed similar results. ICC incidence was very rare. 
      An IPD meta-analysis pooled data from five heterogeneous trials (including primary 
      hrHPV testing and cotesting). A total of 107 cases of ICC among 176,464 women were 
      identified in the trials, with a pooled RR of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.89) over one 
      or two rounds of hrHPV screening compared to cytology alone and 5 to 12 years of 
      followup data. Each of these trials included different patient populations and 
      screening test protocols, adding uncertainty to interpretation of pooled findings. 
      Evidence on subgroups was limited to age and a single cohort study focused on 
      previously inadequately or unscreened women. Women younger than age 35 years had 
      consistently higher rates of hrHPV positivity and of CIN3+. Outcomes of hrHPV 
      primary testing or cotesting by age were not notably different from the results of 
      the overall study populations. A small cohort study of cotesting among 1,832 Spanish 
      women not screened in the previous 5 years found 9 cases of CIN3+; of these, 3 cases 
      of CIN3+ were detected by hrHPV testing but not by cytology alone. The included 
      trials did not report on potential adverse consequences of the screening tests, 
      diagnostic procedures, or treatments and associated harms. Screening test 
      positivity, false-positive rates (FPRs) for CIN2+ detection, and colposcopy 
      referrals tended to be higher in the intervention groups of the trials, particularly 
      at Round 1 screening. FPRs were higher in the intervention arm of one completed 
      primary hrHPV trial and less discrepant in the other trial reporting test 
      performance. In hrHPV cotesting trials, test positivity in the intervention group 
      ranged from 7 to 22 percent of screened women, and was approximately 2- to 3-fold 
      higher than in the control group arm. FPRs were also consistently higher in the 
      intervention group at Round 1 for the three cotesting trials reporting on this 
      outcome, ranging from 6 to 20 percent, and nearly 2- to 3-fold higher than control 
      group rates. Two cotesting trials reported test performance data from Round 2 
      screening; the FPR was similar between arms in one trial, but 2 times higher in the 
      intervention arm in another. Four hrHPV primary screening trials and two cotesting 
      trials reported referrals to colposcopy. Rates of referral to colposcopy in the 
      control groups ranged from 1 to 3 percent. Two primary hrHPV testing trials had more 
      referrals among women in the intervention arms versus control group at Round 1 of 
      screening (8% and 6% vs. 3%). Two other trials of primary hrHPV testing had similar 
      rates of referral in both trial arms. Two hrHPV cotesting trials reported more 
      referrals to colposcopy in the intervention group compared to the control group (11% 
      vs. 3% and 7% vs. 5%). Round 2 colposcopy referral rates, reported only in one 
      cotesting trial, were similar between treatment groups (IG, 3% vs. CG, 2%). Biopsy 
      rates were reported in the IPD meta-analysis; the pooled estimate had very high 
      heterogeneity, largely explained by the 2-fold difference in biopsy rates between 
      intervention and control arms in the two trials that referred all hrHPV+ women to 
      colposcopy. Biopsy rates were similar between arms for the other trials. Data were 
      too sparse to draw conclusions regarding the risk of missed cases of cervical cancer 
      (false negatives) for different screening strategies, given very few cases of ICC 
      detected. Limited evidence on psychological harms from one cross-sectional study 
      (n=428) and a substudy of one cotesting trial (n=2,508) suggested that women 
      receiving hrHPV positive test results experienced increased anxiety and distress, 
      and reduced satisfaction with sexual partnerships. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Eight 
      large randomized trials, four of primary hrHPV testing and four of hrHPV cotesting, 
      contributed to the evidence comparing use of hrHPV testing as part of cervical 
      cancer screening with cytology alone for detection of CIN3+. All trials were 
      conducted in the context of organized screening programs, with heterogeneous 
      screening strategies and followup protocols. Interpretation of trial findings was 
      limited by the fact that after one round of screening, only one trial conducted 
      further screening applying the originally assigned strategies in the control and 
      intervention arms. In all other trials, both arms received the same test at Round 2 
      (either cytology alone or hrHPV cotesting). Primary hrHPV testing increased 
      detection of CIN3+ in the initial round of screening by as much as 2- to 3-fold. 
      Only the trial of primary hrHPV testing, where all women with a positive hrHPV test 
      were referred to colposcopy, had results from two rounds of screening. In that 
      study, CIN3+ detection in Round 1 was 3-fold higher in the primary hrHPV testing 
      arm, and cumulative detection was 1.8-fold higher after the second round of 
      screening. Evidence was mixed in cotesting trials. No trial showed a significant 
      increase in CIN 3+ detection in Round 1 for cotesting. In two of four trials, CIN3+ 
      detection was lower in Round 2 in the hrHPV cotesting arm and higher in the cytology 
      alone arm. Cumulative CIN3+ detection was similar between intervention and control 
      study arms in all trials. Because no trial sustained the intervention and control 
      group protocols beyond two screening rounds, evidence comparing the long-term 
      outcomes of primary hrHPV testing or cotesting with cytology was lacking. Data to 
      compare potential harms of different screening strategies were similarly limited, 
      and none of the included trials or observational studies reported on harms of the 
      screening test or treatments. False-positive rates and referrals to colposcopy were 
      in some trials 2- to 3-fold higher with hrHPV-based screening strategies relative to 
      cytology alone in the first screening round, and evidence was lacking to determine 
      whether these differences might persist over multiple screening rounds. Risks of 
      missed ICC were very low regardless of the screening strategy used. An IPD 
      meta-analysis suggested a lower rate of ICC with hrHPV screening strategies, but 
      this analysis pooled data from trials with distinctly different screening strategies 
      and hrHPV test types, adding uncertainty to interpretation of the findings. In most 
      trials and in a large U.S.-based observational study, women younger than age 30 to 
      35 years had higher rates of hrHPV positivity and CIN3+, accompanied by higher rates 
      of colposcopy. No completed studies compared different screening intervals. All of 
      the RCTs on hrHPV screening were conducted in countries with organized screening 
      programs, which are not available to most women in the United States. Rigorous 
      comparative research is needed in U.S. screening settings to examine longer 
      screening intervals, long-term outcomes, and to identify effective strategies for 
      outreach and screening of poorly screened and unscreened women. The higher 
      sensitivity of hrHPV testing in a single round may have potential to improve 
      outcomes in this high-risk population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients referred to cardiac surgery for cardiovascular disease are at 
      significant risk for the development of major postoperative adverse events despite 
      significant advances in surgical techniques and perioperative care. Statins 
      (5-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors) have gained 
      a pivotal role in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease 
      and are thought to improve perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac 
      surgery. This review is an updated version of a review that was first published in 
      2012. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of preoperative statin therapy in 
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1950 to 
      November 2013 Week 3), EMBASE (1980 to 3 December 2013 (Week 48)) and the 
      metaRegister of Controlled Trials. Additionally, we searched ongoing trials through 
      the National Research Register, the ClinicalTrials.gov registry and grey literature. 
      We screened online conference indices from relevant scientific meetings (2006 to 
      2014) to look for eligible trials. We applied no language restrictions. SELECTION 
      CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials comparing any statin treatment before 
      cardiac surgery, for any given duration and dose, versus no preoperative statin 
      therapy (standard of care) or placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review 
      authors evaluated trial quality and extracted data from titles and abstracts 
      identified by electronic database searches according to predefined criteria. 
      Accordingly, we retrieved full-text articles of potentially relevant studies that 
      met the inclusion criteria to assess definitive eligibility for inclusion. We 
      reported effect measures as odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences (WMDs) 
      with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We identified 17 randomised 
      controlled studies including a total of 2138 participants undergoing on-pump or 
      off-pump cardiac surgical procedures, and added to this review six studies with 1154 
      additional participants. Pooled analysis showed that statin treatment before surgery 
      reduced the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR 0.54, 95% CI 
      0.43 to 0.67; P value < 0.01; 12 studies, 1765 participants) but failed to influence 
      short-term mortality (OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.38 to 8.54; P value = 0.46; two studies, 300 
      participants) or postoperative stroke (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.14 to 3.63; P value = 0.67; 
      two studies, 264 participants). In addition, statin therapy was associated with a 
      shorter stay for patients on the intensive care unit (ICU) (WMD -3.19 hours, 95% CI 
      -5.41 to -0.98; nine studies, 721 participants) and in the hospital (WMD -0.48 days, 
      95% CI -0.78 to -0.19; 11 studies, 1137 participants) when significant heterogeneity 
      was observed. Results showed no reduction in myocardial infarction (OR 0.48, 95% CI 
      0.21 to 1.13; seven studies, 901 participants) or renal failure (OR 0.57, 95% CI 
      0.30 to 1.10; five studies, 467 participants) and were not affected by subgroup 
      analysis. Trials investigating this safety endpoint reported no major or minor 
      perioperative side effects of statins. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative statin 
      therapy reduces the odds of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) and shortens the 
      patient's stay on the ICU and in the hospital. Statin pretreatment had no influence 
      on perioperative mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction or renal failure, but only 
      two of all included studies assessed mortality. As analysed studies included mainly 
      individuals undergoing myocardial revascularisation, results cannot be extrapolated 
      to patients undergoing other cardiac procedures such as heart valve or aortic 
      surgery.

OAB - Cardiac surgery can effectively treat patients with heart disease but is associated 
      with a risk ratio for adverse events at the same time. Despite the increasing 
      proportion of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with major co‐morbidities, 
      operative results have remained stable during past decades, which may be related to 
      advancements in surgical techniques. Nonetheless, perioperative care of these 
      patients remains to be optimised. Statins (HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors) are 
      prescribed to lower blood cholesterol levels but are known to provide beneficial 
      effects beyond their lipid‐lowering properties. In the past, studies have shown that 
      statins are linked to lower mortality in patients with atherosclerotic 
      cardiovascular disease. However, evidence for the beneficial effects of statins in 
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery is inconsistent, as it is mainly extracted from 
      observational studies and only a few small randomised clinical trials. The aim of 
      this review is to gather current evidence for preoperative statin therapy for 
      reducing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients referred for cardiac 
      surgical procedures. The first review was published in 2012, and the present review 
      is an updated version. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials. We identified 17 
      studies dating from 1999 to 2014 with a total of 2138 participants undergoing 
      cardiac surgical procedures. All included trials were randomised studies comparing 
      statin treatment with a control intervention (no statin medication) or placebo in 
      patients who were predominantly referred for coronary artery bypass grafting 
      surgery. Preoperative statin therapy resulted in a reduction in postoperative atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) (12 studies) and a shorter stay both on the ICU (nine studies) and 
      in the hospital (11 studies). Although statin pretreatment was associated with lower 
      incidences of myocardial infarction (seven studies) and renal failure (five 
      studies), these results did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, statin 
      therapy had no impact on short‐term mortality (two studies) or postoperative stroke 
      (two studies). No serious side effects of statin therapy given before cardiac 
      surgery were reported. However, all analysed studies included mainly patients 
      undergoing coronary bypass operations, thus results of these studies may not be 
      generalisable to patients undergoing cardiac procedures other than coronary artery 
      bypass grafting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sevoflurane induction for general anaesthesia has been reported to be 
      safe, reliable and well accepted by patients. Sevoflurane induction uses either low 
      or high initial concentrations. The low initial concentration technique involves 
      initially administering a low concentration of sevoflurane and gradually increasing 
      the concentration of the dose until the patient is anaesthetized. The high initial 
      concentration technique involves administering high concentrations from the 
      beginning, then continuing with those high doses until the patient is anaesthetized. 
      This review was originally published in 2013 and has been updated in 2016. 
      OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare induction times and complication rates between high 
      and low initial concentration sevoflurane anaesthetic induction techniques in adults 
      and children who received inhalational induction for general anaesthesia. We defined 
      'high' as greater than or equal to and 'low' as less than a 4% initial 
      concentration. SEARCH METHODS: For the updated review, we searched the following 
      databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2), 
      MEDLINE (1950 to February 2016), EMBASE (1980 to February 2016), Latin American 
      Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to February 2016) and the 
      Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1946 to February 2016). 
      We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings 
      and contacted the authors of included trials. The original search was run in 
      September 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought all published and unpublished, 
      randomized controlled trials comparing high versus low initial sevoflurane 
      concentration inhalational induction. Our primary outcomes included two measures of 
      anaesthesia (time to loss of the eyelash reflex (LOER) and time until a weighted 
      object held in the patient's hand was dropped), time to successful insertion of a 
      laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and time to endotracheal intubation. Other outcomes were 
      complications of the technique. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standardized 
      methods for conducting a systematic review as described in the Cochrane Handbook for 
      Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two review authors independently extracted 
      details of trial methods and outcome data from reports of all trials considered 
      eligible for inclusion. We conducted all analyses on an intention-to-treat basis, 
      when possible. We estimated overall treatment effects by using a fixed-effect model 
      when we found no substantial heterogeneity, whereas we applied the random-effects 
      model in the presence of considerable heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We reran the 
      searches and included one new study (100 participants) in this updated review. In 
      total, we included 11 studies with 829 participants, although most analyses were 
      based on data from fewer participants and evidence of low quality. We noted 
      substantial heterogeneity in the included trials. Thus, our results should be read 
      with caution. It was not possible to combine trials for the primary outcome (LOER), 
      but individual trials reported faster induction times (typically 24 to 82 seconds 
      faster, 41 seconds (31.37 to 50.62)) with high initial concentration sevoflurane 
      (six studies, 443 participants, low-quality evidence). Apnoea appeared to be more 
      common in the high initial concentration sevoflurane group (risk ratio (RR) 3.14, 
      95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 5.7, two studies, 160 participants, low-quality 
      evidence). We found no evidence of differences between the two groups in the 
      incidence of cough (odds ratio (OR) 1.23, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.81, eight studies, 589 
      participants, low-quality evidence), laryngospasm (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.16 to 15.9, 
      seven studies, 588 participants, low-quality evidence), breath holding (OR 1.16, 95% 
      CI 0.47 to 2.83, five studies, 389 participants, low-quality evidence), patient 
      movement (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.89, five studies, 445 participants, low-quality 
      evidence) or bradycardia (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.88, three studies, 199 
      participants, low-quality evidence), and the overall incidence of complications was 
      low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A high initial concentration sevoflurane technique 
      probably offers more rapid induction of anaesthesia and a similar rate of 
      complications, except for apnoea, which may be more common with a high initial 
      concentration. However, this conclusion is not definitive because the included 
      studies provided evidence of low quality.

BTI - Data-supported timely management in cooperation with a physician-staffed centre for 
      telemedicine in advanced cardiac failure: IQWiG Reports – Commission No. N19-01
AB  - On 28 March 2019, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned the Institute for 
      Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) with the assessment of data-supported 
      timely management in cooperation with a physician-staffed centre for telemedicine 
      (hereinafter also referred to as “telemonitoring with defined minimum requirements”) 
      for patients with advanced cardiac failure. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of the 
      present report is the benefit assessment of telemonitoring with defined minimum 
      requirements in addition to standard care and the resulting interventions as 
      management strategy in comparison with standard care without telemonitoring in 
      patients with advanced cardiac failure regarding patient-relevant outcomes. METHODS: 
      The target population of the benefit assessment consisted of patients with advanced 
      cardiac failure. The experimental intervention was telemonitoring with defined 
      minimum requirements in addition to standard care and the resulting interventions as 
      management strategy. Telemonitoring had to have the following specifics: at least 
      daily transmission of at least the following parameters to a telemonitoring centre: 
      heart rate and rhythm, as well as information on the general state of health (e.g. 
      from self-assessment questionnaires or data on physical activity); close analysis of 
      the data by a telemonitoring centre under the responsibility of a physician in 
      addition to the treating physician; defined maximum reaction times of the 
      telemonitoring centre (up to 1 working day) or of the treating physician (within 24 
      hours after knowledge). The comparator treatment was standard care without 
      telemonitoring. Patient-relevant outcomes were considered in the assessment. Only 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the benefit assessment. Studies 
      with at least 6 months of follow-up observation were included. A systematic 
      literature search for studies was conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, 
      Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. In parallel, a 
      search for relevant systematic reviews was conducted in the databases MEDLINE, 
      Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. In addition, the following 
      information sources and search techniques were considered: study registries, 
      documents sent by the G-BA, the websites of G-BA and IQWiG, as well as the screening 
      of reference lists and author queries. In order to assess the qualitative certainty 
      of the results, the criteria of the risk of bias across outcomes were evaluated, and 
      the risk of bias was classified as low or high. If the studies were comparable 
      regarding the research question and relevant characteristics and no relevant 
      heterogeneity was observed, the individual results were pooled quantitatively by 
      means of meta-analyses. RESULTS: The information retrieval identified 4 RCTs as 
      relevant for the research question of the present benefit assessment. No planned or 
      ongoing studies were identified. The last search was conducted on 9 May 2019. In the 
      included studies, the data were either measured automatically by the implanted 
      device (implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD] or cardiac resynchronization 
      therapy [CRT]) and transmitted daily without involvement of the patients, or the 
      patients themselves performed measurements once a day using external, non-invasive 
      devices, and assessed their state of health. The data were then transmitted 
      automatically. The risk of bias was high in all studies. The follow-up observation 
      period was between 12 months and 24 months. CONCLUSION: The 4 included studies 
      investigated 2 different telemonitoring strategies with defined minimum 
      requirements. In telemonitoring type 1, the data were automatically measured by the 
      implanted device (ICD or CRT-defibrillator [CRT-D]), no involvement of the patient 
      was necessary. In telemonitoring type 2, it was the patient’s task to measure the 
      data using external, non-invasive devices. Including all studies, there was no hint 
      of a benefit or harm of telemonitoring for the outcome “all-cause mortality”. Data 
      for the subgroups of patients with and without depressive symptoms were only 
      available for telemonitoring type 2. For the outcome “all-cause mortality”, there 
      was an indication of a benefit for patients without depressive symptoms. The joint 
      consideration of telemonitoring type 1 and type 2 showed a hint of a benefit for the 
      outcome “cardiovascular mortality”. There was no hint of a benefit or harm of 
      telemonitoring with defined minimum requirements for the following outcomes: 
      hospitalization overall, cardiovascular hospitalization, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia 
      requiring treatment, thromboembolic events, shocks delivered by a cardiac device and 
      morbidity due to cardiac failure. Due to the incomplete data, no conclusion on the 
      benefit was drawn for the following outcomes: serious adverse events (SAEs), 
      depressive symptoms, cardiac decompensation, health status and health-related 
      quality of life.
