AB  - TOPIC: A comparison between ranibizumab and bevacizumab of the incidence of systemic serious adverse events (SAEs) among patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) who participated in a large-scale randomized trial. Use of individual patient data, rather than aggregate data, allowed adjustment for strong predictors of SAEs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Relative safety of ranibizumab and bevacizumab is important in choosing an anti-VEGF drug for the hundreds of thousands of patients with nAMD treated each year worldwide. METHODS: Results of a Cochrane aggregate meta-analysis of the relative efficacy and safety of bevacizumab and ranibizumab that used searches of bibliographic databases and clinical trial registries as of March 14, 2014 and hand searching were reviewed to identify 6 large-scale, multicenter clinical trials. Individual patient data on SAEs, assigned drug and dosing regimen, and baseline prognostic factors were requested from the leaders of the 6 trials. A two-stage approach was used to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for baseline prognostic factors. The primary outcome measure was development of >/=1 SAE; secondary outcome measures were death, arteriothrombotic events, events associated with systemic anti-VEGF therapy, and events not associated with systemic anti-VEGF therapy. RESULTS: Individual patient data were received from 5 trials to provide information on 3052 patients. There were no large imbalances between drug groups on baseline factors. The adjusted relative risk (95% CI) for bevacizumab relative to ranibizumab was 1.06 [(0.84, 1.35); p=0.61] for >/=1 SAEs. For secondary outcomes, adjusted relative risks were 0.99 [ (0.69, 1.43); p=0.97] for death, 0.89 [ (0.62, 1.28); p=0.53] for arteriothrombotic events, 1.10 [ (0.81, 1.50); p=0.54] for events related to anti-VEGF treatment, and 1.11 [ (0.87, 1.40); p=0.40] for events not related to anti-VEGF treatment. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the absence of large differences in risk of systemic serious adverse events between these two anti-VEGF drugs; i.e., relative risks of >/=1.5 are unlikely. Because additional head-to-head trials are unlikely, any further investigation of differential risk between anti-VEGF agents will only be achieved though post-marketing surveillance or through the interrogation of healthcare databases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum manifests as slow parasite clearance but this measure is also influenced by host immunity, initial parasite biomass and partner drug efficacy. This study collated data from clinical trials of artemisinin derivatives in falciparum malaria with frequent parasite counts to provide reference parasite clearance estimates stratified by location, treatment and time, to examine host factors affecting parasite clearance, and to assess the relationships between parasite clearance and risk of recrudescence during follow-up. METHODS: Data from 24 studies, conducted from 1996 to 2013, with frequent parasite counts were pooled. Parasite clearance half-life (PC1/2) was estimated using the WWARN Parasite Clearance Estimator. Random effects regression models accounting for study and site heterogeneity were used to explore factors affecting PC1/2 and risk of recrudescence within areas with reported delayed parasite clearance (western Cambodia, western Thailand after 2000, southern Vietnam, southern Myanmar) and in all other areas where parasite populations are artemisinin sensitive. RESULTS: PC1/2 was estimated in 6975 patients, 3288 of whom also had treatment outcomes evaluate d during 28-63 days follow-up, with 93 (2.8 %) PCR-confirmed recrudescences. In areas with artemisinin-sensitive parasites, the median PC1/2 following three-day artesunate treatment (4 mg/kg/day) ranged from 1.8 to 3.0 h and the proportion of patients with PC1/2 >5 h from 0 to 10 %. Artesunate doses of 4 mg/kg/day decreased PC1/2 by 8.1 % (95 % CI 3.2-12.6) compared to 2 mg/kg/day, except in populations with delayed parasite clearance. PC1/2 was longer in children and in patients with fever or anaemia at enrolment. Long PC1/2 (HR = 2.91, 95 % CI 1.95-4.34 for twofold increase, p < 0.001) and high initial parasitaemia (HR = 2.23, 95 % CI 1.44-3.45 for tenfold increase, p < 0.001) were associated independently with an increased risk of recrudescence. In western Cambodia, the region with the highest prevalence of artemisinin resistance, there was no evidence for increasing PC1/2 since 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors affect PC1/2. As substantial heterogeneity in parasite clearance exists between locations, early detection of artemisinin resistance requires reference PC1/2 data. Studies with frequent parasite count measurements to characterize PC1/2 should be encouraged. In western Cambodia, where PC1/2 values are longest, there is no evidence for recent emergence of higher levels of artemisinin resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the efficacy of the licensed mepolizumab dose (100 mg subcutaneously [SC]) in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma according to body weight/body mass index (BMI). METHODS: This was a post hoc individual patient-level meta-analysis of data from the Phase 3 studies MENSA (MEA115588/NCT01691521) and MUSCA (200862/NCT02281318). Patients aged >/=12 years with severe eosinophilic asthma and a history of exacerbations were randomised to 4-weekly placebo, mepolizumab 75 mg intravenously (IV) or 100 mg SC (MENSA) or placebo or mepolizumab 100 mg SC (MUSCA) for 32 (MENSA) or 24 (MUSCA) weeks. The primary endpoint was the annual rate of clinically significant exacerbations; other outcomes included the proportion of patients with no exacerbations, lung function, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) scores and blood eosinophil counts. Analyses were performed by baseline body weight and BMI (</=60, > 60-75, > 75-90, > 90, < 100, >/=100 kg; </=25, > 25-30, > 30, < 36, >/=36 kg/m(2)). RESULTS: Overall, 936 patients received placebo or mepolizumab 100 mg SC. Across all body weight/BMI categories, mepolizumab reduced the rate of clinically significant exacerbations by 49-70% versus placebo. Improvements with mepolizumab versus placebo were also seen in lung function in all body weight/BMI categories except > 90 kg; improvements in SGRQ and ACQ-5 scores were seen across all categories. CONCLUSIONS: Mepolizumab 100 mg SC has consistent clinical benefits in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma across a range of body weights and BMIs. Data show that the fixed-dose regimen of mepolizumab is suitable, without the need for weight-based dosing.

AB  - Endoscopic variceal ligation plus beta-blockers (EVL+BB) is currently recommended for variceal rebleeding prophylaxis, a recommendation that extends to all patients with cirrhosis with previous variceal bleeding irrespective of prognostic stage. Individualizing patient care is relevant, and in published studies on variceal rebleeding prophylaxis, there is a lack of information regarding response to therapy by prognostic stage. This study aimed at comparing EVL plus BB with monotherapy (EVL or BB) on all-source rebleeding and mortality in patients with cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding stratified by cirrhosis severity (Child A versus B/C) by means of individual time-to-event patient data meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials. The study used individual data on 389 patients from three trials comparing EVL plus BB versus BB and 416 patients from four trials comparing EVL plus BB versus EVL. Compared with BB alone, EVL plus BB reduced overall rebleeding in Child A (incidence rate ratio 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.89; P = 0.025) but not in Child B/C, without differences in mortality. The effect of EVL on rebleeding was different according to Child (P for interaction <0.001). Conversely, compared with EVL, EVL plus BB reduced rebleeding in both Child A and B/C, with a significant reduction in mortality in Child B/C (incidence rate ratio 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.85; P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: Outcomes of therapies to prevent variceal rebleeding differ depending on cirrhosis severity: in patients with preserved liver function (Child A), combination therapy is recommended because it is more effective in preventing rebleeding, without modifying survival, while in patients with advanced liver failure (Child B/C), EVL alone carries an increased risk of rebleeding and death compared with combination therapy, underlining that BB is the key element of combination therapy.

AB  - On February 22, 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg; Pfizer, New York City, NY), intended for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Mylotarg was designated as an orphan medicinal product on October 18, 2000. The applicant for this medicinal product was Pfizer Limited (marketing authorization now held by Pfizer Europe MA EEIG).The demonstrated benefit with Mylotarg is improvement in event-free survival. This has been shown in the pivotal ALFA-0701 (MF-3) study. In addition, an individual patient data meta-analysis from five randomized controlled trials (3,325 patients) showed that the addition of Mylotarg significantly reduced the risk of relapse (odds ratio [OR] 0.81; 95% CI: 0.73-0.90; p = .0001), and improved overall survival at 5 years (OR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82-0.98; p = .01) [Lancet Oncol 2014;15:986-996]. The most common (>30%) side effects of Mylotarg when used together with daunorubicin and cytarabine are hemorrhage and infection.The full indication is as follows: "Mylotarg is indicated for combination therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) for the treatment of patients age 15 years and above with previously untreated, de novo CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML), except acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)."The objective of this article is to summarize the scientific review done by the CHMP of the application leading to regulatory approval in the European Union. The full scientific assessment report and product information, including the Summary of Product Characteristics, are available on the European Medicines Agency website (www.ema.europa.eu). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article reflects the scientific assessment of Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin; Pfizer, New York City, NY) use for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia based on important contributions from the rapporteur and co-rapporteur assessment teams, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use members, and additional experts following the application for a marketing authorization from the company. It's a unique opportunity to look at the data from a regulatory point of view and the importance of assessing the benefit-risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) completely resorbs within 3 years after coronary artery implantation. The safety and effectiveness of BVS through this critical 3-year period have not been characterized. METHODS: We performed an individual-patient-data pooled meta-analysis of the 4 randomized ABSORB trials in which 3389 patients with coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to everolimus-eluting Absorb BVS (n=2164) or cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents (n=1225). The primary efficacy outcome measure was target lesion failure (cardiac mortality, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization), and the primary safety outcome measure was device thrombosis. RESULTS: BVS compared with cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents resulted in higher 3-year rates of target lesion failure (11.7% versus 8.1%; risk ratio [RR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.73; P=0.006), driven by greater target vessel myocardial infarction (7.8% versus 4.2%; RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.26-2.35; P=0.0006) and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (6.6% versus 4.4%; RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.05-1.98; P=0.02), with comparable cardiac mortality (1.1% versus 1.1%; RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.47-1.88; P=0.85). Device thrombosis rates through 3 years were also higher with BVS (2.4% versus 0.6%; RR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.70-8.11; P=0.001). Between 1 and 3 years, target lesion failure rates (6.1% versus 3.9%; P=0.02) and device thrombosis rates (1.1% versus 0.0%; P<0.0001) were higher with BVS than cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents. CONCLUSIONS: In the present individual-patient-data pooled meta-analysis of the ABSORB trials, BVS was associated with increased rates of target lesion failure and device thrombosis between 1 and 3 years and cumulatively through 3 years of follow-up compared with everolimus-eluting stents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) offer the potential to improve long-term outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention after their complete bioresorption. Randomised trials have shown non-inferiority between BVS and metallic drug-eluting stents at 1 year in composite safety and effectiveness outcomes, although some increases in rates of target vessel-related myocardial infarction and device thrombosis were identified. Outcomes of BVS following the first year after implantation are unknown. We sought to ascertain whether BVS are as safe and effective as drug-eluting stents within 2 years after implantation and between 1 and 2 years. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials in which patients were randomly assigned to everolimus-eluting Absorb BVS or metallic everolimus-eluting stents (EES) and followed up for at least 2 years. We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, TCTMD, ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical Trial Results, CardioSource, and abstracts and presentations from major cardiovascular meetings up to April 1, 2017, to identify relevant studies. The primary efficacy outcome measure was the device-oriented composite endpoint (cardiac mortality, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation) and the primary safety outcome measure was definite or probable device thrombosis. Individual patient data from the four ABSORB trials were used for landmark and subgroup analysis and multivariable modelling. FINDINGS: We identified seven randomised trials in which 5583 patients were randomly assigned to Absorb BVS (n=3261) or metallic EES (n=2322) and followed up for 2 years. BVS had higher 2-year relative risks of the device-oriented composite endpoint than did EES (9.4% [304 of 3217] vs 7.4% [169 of 2299]; relative risk [RR] 1.29 [95% CI 1.08-1.56], p=0.0059). These differences were driven by increased rates of target vessel-related myocardial infarction (5.8% [187 of 3218] vs 3.2% [74 of 2299]; RR 1.68 [95% CI 1.29-2.19], p=0.0003) and ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation (5.3% [169 of 3217] vs 3.9% [90 of 2300]; 1.40 [1.09-1.80], p=0.0090) with BVS, with non-significant differences in cardiac mortality. The cumulative 2-year incidence of device thrombosis was higher with BVS than with EES (2.3% [73 of 3187] vs 0.7% [16 of 2281]; RR 3.35 [95% CI 1.96-5.72], p<0.0001). Landmark analysis between 1 and 2 years also showed higher rates of the device-oriented composite endpoint (3.3% [69 of 2100] vs 1.9% [23 of 1193]; RR 1.64 [95% CI 1.03-2.61], p=0.0376) and device thrombosis (0.5% [11 of 2085] vs none [0 of 1183], p<0.0001) in BVS-treated patients than in EES-treated patients. INTERPRETATION: BVS was associated with increased rates of composite device-oriented adverse events and device thrombosis cumulatively at 2 years and between 1 and 2 years of follow-up compared with EES.

AB  - Background and Purpose- There is contradictory evidence on the impact of the stroke side (hemisphere) on outcomes. We investigated any effect modification by laterality on stroke patients' outcomes in recent endovascular trials. Methods- Individual patient-level data were combined in this meta-analysis of all patients included in randomized trials comparing endovascular thrombectomy predominantly done with stent retrievers with standard care in anterior circulation ischemic patients with stroke (HERMES [Highly Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices] Collaboration). We stratified the 90-day functional outcome assessed by ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale according to the stroke side of patients treated with endovascular therapy versus standard care, adjusted for important prognostic variables. Results- The meta-analysis included 1737 patients (871 right hemispheric strokes and 866 left hemispheric) from 7 trials. Baseline median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were significantly higher in left (20) versus right (16) hemispheric strokes (P<0.001). Other clinical and radiological baseline characteristics were similar. The beneficial response to endovascular therapy assessed by 90-day modified Rankin Scale shift was not modified by the side of the stroke. There were no significant differences between right and left hemispheric stroke in the 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score </=2; 40.7% [95% CI, 37.4%-44.1%] versus 37.6% [95% CI, 37.4%-44.1%]; P=0.19), median final infarct volumes (45 versus 39.5 mL, P=0.51), nor 90-day mortality (15.1% vs 16.8%, P=0.31). Conclusions- Stroke side was not a prognostic factor and did not modify the treatment effect among patients treated in the endovascular or control groups in recent endovascular thrombectomy trials.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Chronic neuropathic pain, the most frequent condition affecting the peripheral nervous system, remains underdiagnosed and difficult to treat. Inhaled cannabis may alleviate chronic neuropathic pain. Our objective was to synthesize the evidence on the use of inhaled cannabis for chronic neuropathic pain. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of individual patient data. We registered our protocol with PROSPERO CRD42011001182. We searched in Cochrane Central, PubMed, EMBASE, and AMED. We considered all randomized controlled trials investigating chronic painful neuropathy and comparing inhaled cannabis with placebo. We pooled treatment effects following a hierarchical random-effects Bayesian responder model for the population-averaged subject-specific effect. Our evidence synthesis of individual patient data from 178 participants with 405 observed responses in 5 randomized controlled trials following patients for days to weeks provides evidence that inhaled cannabis results in short-term reductions in chronic neuropathic pain for 1 in every 5 to 6 patients treated (number needed to treat = 5.6 with a Bayesian 95% credible interval ranging between 3.4 and 14). Our inferences were insensitive to model assumptions, priors, and parameter choices. We caution that the small number of studies and participants, the short follow-up, shortcomings in allocation concealment, and considerable attrition limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the review. The Bayes factor is 332, corresponding to a posterior probability of effect of 99.7%. PERSPECTIVE: This novel Bayesian meta-analysis of individual patient data from 5 randomized trials suggests that inhaled cannabis may provide short-term relief for 1 in 5 to 6 patients with neuropathic pain. Pragmatic trials are needed to evaluate the long-term benefits and risks of this treatment.

AB  - AIMS: Iron deficiency (ID) is a common co-morbidity in patients with heart failure (HF) and has been suggested to be associated with poor prognosis. Recently completed double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying HF patients with ID have shown improvements in functional capacity, symptoms and quality of life when treated with i.v. ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). This individual patient data meta-analysis investigates the effect of FCM vs. placebo on recurrent hospitalisations and mortality in HF patients with ID. METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual patient data were extracted from four RCTs comparing FCM with placebo in patients with systolic HF and ID. The main outcome measures were recurrent cardiovascular (CV) hospitalisations and CV mortality. Other outcomes included cause-specific hospitalisations and death. The main analyses of recurrent events were backed up by time-to-first-event analyses. In total, 839 patients, of whom 504 were randomised to FCM, were included. Compared with those taking placebo, patients on FCM had lower rates of recurrent CV hospitalisations and CV mortality [rate ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40-0.88; P = 0.009]. Treatment with FCM also reduced recurrent HF hospitalisations and CV mortality (rate ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.33-0.86; P = 0.011) and recurrent CV hospitalisations and all-cause mortality (rate ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.88; P = 0.009). Time-to-first-event analyses showed similar findings, with somewhat attenuated treatment effects. The administration of i.v. FCM was not associated with an increased risk for adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with i.v. FCM was associated with a reduction in recurrent CV hospitalisations in systolic HF patients with ID.

AB  - Background: Ramucirumab, the human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody receptor antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, has been approved for treating gastric/gastroesophageal junction, non-small-cell lung, and metastatic colorectal cancers. With the completion of six global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trials across multiple tumor types, an opportunity now exists to further establish the safety parameters of ramucirumab across a large patient population. Materials and methods: An individual patient meta-analysis across the six completed phase III trials was conducted and the relative risk (RR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using fixed-effects or mixed-effects models for all-grade and high-grade adverse events (AEs) possibly related to vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibition. The number needed to harm was also calculable due to the placebo-controlled nature of all six registration standard trials. Results: A total of 4996 treated patients (N = 2748 in the ramucirumab arm and N = 2248 in the control, placebo arm) were included in this meta-analysis. Arterial thromboembolic events [ATE; all-grade, RR: 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.3; high-grade (grade >/=3), RR: 0.9, 95% CI 0.5-1.7], venous thromboembolic events (VTE; all-grade, RR: 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.1; high-grade, RR: 0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.2), high-grade bleeding (RR: 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.5), and high-grade gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (RR: 1.1, 95% CI 0.7-1.7) did not demonstrate a definite increased risk with ramucirumab. A higher percentage of hypertension, proteinuria, low-grade (grade 1-2) bleeding, GI perforation, infusion-related reaction, and wound-healing complications were observed in the ramucirumab arm compared with the control arm. Conclusions: Ramucirumab may be distinct among antiangiogenic agents in terms of ATE, VTE, high-grade bleeding, or high-grade GI bleeding by showing no clear evidence for an increased risk of these AEs in this meta-analysis of a large and diverse patient population. Ramucirumab is consistent with other angiogenic inhibitors in the risk of developing certain AEs.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of atomoxetine on emotional control in adults with ADHD. METHODS: We performed an integrated analysis using individual patient data pooled from three Eli Lilly-sponsored studies. An integrated analysis can be viewed as a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data, rather than study-level summary data. RESULTS: Two populations were identified: a large sample of patients with pre-treatment baseline data (the "overall population"; n=2846); and a subset of these patients with placebo-controlled efficacy data from baseline to 10 or 12 weeks after initiating treatment (the "placebo-controlled population"; n=829). At baseline, in the overall population, approximately 50% of ADHD patients had BRIEF-AS (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version Self-Report) Emotional control subscores between 21 and 30, compared with approximately 10% of normative subjects in the BRIEF-A manual. At endpoint, in the placebo-controlled population, atomoxetine led to a small (effect size 0.19) but significant (P=0.013) treatment effect for emotional control. The effect size was 0.32 in patients with BRIEF-AS Emotional control scores>20 at baseline. Improvements in emotional control correlated with improvements in the core ADHD symptoms and quality-of-life. DISCUSSION: As deficient emotional control is associated with impaired social, educational and occupational functioning over and above that explained by core ADHD symptoms alone, improvements in emotional control may be clinically relevant. CONCLUSION: At baseline, adults with ADHD were more likely to have impaired emotional control than normative subjects. In the adult ADHD patients, atomoxetine treatment was associated with improvements in emotional control, as well as in core ADHD symptoms and quality-of-life.

AB  - Importance: There are potential benefits and harms of hyperoxemia and hypoxemia for extremely preterm infants receiving more vs less supplemental oxygen. Objective: To compare the effects of different target ranges for oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) on death or major morbidity. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospectively planned meta-analysis of individual participant data from 5 randomized clinical trials (conducted from 2005-2014) enrolling infants born before 28 weeks' gestation. Exposures: Spo2 target range that was lower (85%-89%) vs higher (91%-95%). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of death or major disability (bilateral blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy diagnosed as >/=2 level on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, or Bayley-III cognitive or language score <85) at a corrected age of 18 to 24 months. There were 16 secondary outcomes including the components of the primary outcome and other major morbidities. Results: A total of 4965 infants were randomized (2480 to the lower Spo2 target range and 2485 to the higher Spo2 range) and had a median gestational age of 26 weeks (interquartile range, 25-27 weeks) and a mean birth weight of 832 g (SD, 190 g). The primary outcome occurred in 1191 of 2228 infants (53.5%) in the lower Spo2 target group and 1150 of 2229 infants (51.6%) in the higher Spo2 target group (risk difference, 1.7% [95% CI, -1.3% to 4.6%]; relative risk [RR], 1.04 [95% CI, 0.98 to 1.09], P = .21). Of the 16 secondary outcomes, 11 were null, 2 significantly favored the lower Spo2 target group, and 3 significantly favored the higher Spo2 target group. Death occurred in 484 of 2433 infants (19.9%) in the lower Spo2 target group and 418 of 2440 infants (17.1%) in the higher Spo2 target group (risk difference, 2.8% [95% CI, 0.6% to 5.0%]; RR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.04 to 1.31], P = .01). Treatment for retinopathy of prematurity was administered to 220 of 2020 infants (10.9%) in the lower Spo2 target group and 308 of 2065 infants (14.9%) in the higher Spo2 target group (risk difference, -4.0% [95% CI, -6.1% to -2.0%]; RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.86], P < .001). Severe necrotizing enterocolitis occurred in 227 of 2464 infants (9.2%) in the lower Spo2 target group and 170 of 2465 infants (6.9%) in the higher Spo2 target group (risk difference, 2.3% [95% CI, 0.8% to 3.8%]; RR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.10 to 1.61], P = .003). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prospectively planned meta-analysis of individual participant data from extremely preterm infants, there was no significant difference between a lower Spo2 target range compared with a higher Spo2 target range on the primary composite outcome of death or major disability at a corrected age of 18 to 24 months. The lower Spo2 target range was associated with a higher risk of death and necrotizing enterocolitis, but a lower risk of retinopathy of prematurity treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) improves survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) for preterm African American infants. STUDY DESIGN: An individual participant data meta-analysis was conducted, including 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials that enrolled infants born at <34 weeks of gestation receiving respiratory support, had at least 15% (or a minimum of 10 infants in each trial arm) of African American race, and used a starting iNO of >5 parts per million with the intention to treat for 7 days minimum. The primary outcome was a composite of death or BPD. Secondary outcomes included death before discharge, postnatal steroid use, gross pulmonary air leak, pulmonary hemorrhage, measures of respiratory support, and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: Compared with other races, African American infants had a significant reduction in the composite outcome of death or BPD with iNO treatment: 49% treated vs 63% controls (relative risk, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.91; P = .003; interaction P = .016). There were no differences between racial groups for death. There was also a significant difference between races (interaction P = .023) of iNO treatment for BPD in survivors, with the greatest effect in African American infants (P = .005). There was no difference between racial groups in the use of postnatal steroids, pulmonary air leak, pulmonary hemorrhage, or other measures of respiratory support. CONCLUSION: iNO therapy should be considered for preterm African American infants at high risk for BPD. iNO to prevent BPD in African Americans may represent an example of a racially customized therapy for infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is an important quality assurance measure for colonoscopy. Some studies suggest that narrow-band imaging (NBI) may be more effective at detecting adenomas than white-light endoscopy (WLE) when bowel preparation is optimal. We conducted a meta-analysis of data from individual patients in randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of NBI to WLE in detection of adenomas. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases through April 2017 for randomized controlled trials that assessed detection of colon polyps by high-definition WLE vs NBI and from which data on individual patients were available. The primary outcome measure was ADR adjusted for bowel preparation quality. Multilevel regression models were used with patients nested within trials, and trial included as a random effect. RESULTS: We collected data from 11 trials, comprising 4491 patients and 6636 polyps detected. Adenomas were detected in 952 of 2251 (42.3%) participants examined by WLE vs 1011 of 2239 (45.2%) participants examined by NBI (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] for detection of adenoma by WLE vs NBI, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.29; P = .04). NBI outperformed WLE only when bowel preparation was best: adequate preparation OR, 1.07 (95% CI, 0.92-1.24; P = .38) vs best preparation OR, 1.30 (95% CI, 1.04-1.62; P = .02). Second-generation bright NBI had a better ADR than WLE (second-generation NBI OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.56; P = .02), whereas first-generation NBI did not. NBI detected more non-adenomatous polyps than WLE (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.44; P = .008) and flat polyps than WLE (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02-1.51; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis of data from individual patients in randomized controlled trials, we found NBI to have a higher ADR than WLE, and that this effect is greater when bowel preparation is optimal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of urinary alkalinization in cardiac surgery patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) is controversial and trial findings conflicting. Accordingly, the authors performed a prospectively planned individual patient data meta-analysis of the double-blind randomized trials in this field. METHODS: The authors studied 877 patients from three double-blind, randomized controlled trials enrolled to receive either 24 h of intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate or sodium chloride. The primary outcome measure was a postoperative increase in serum creatinine concentration of greater than 25% or 0.5 mg/dl (> 44 muM/L) within the first five postoperative days. Secondary outcomes included the raw change in serum creatinine, greater than 50% and greater than 100% rises in serum creatinine, developing AKI (Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria), initiation of renal replacement therapy, morbidity, and mortality. RESULTS: Patients were similar in demographics, comorbidities, and cardiac procedures. Sodium bicarbonate increased plasma bicarbonate (P < 0.001) and urine pH (P < 0.001). There were no differences in the development of the primary outcome (Bicarbonate 45% [39-51%] vs. Saline 42% [36-48%], P = 0.29). This result remained unchanged when controlling for study and covariates (odds ratio [OR], 99% confidence interval [CI]: Bicarbonate vs. Control, 1.11 [0.77-1.60], P = 0.45). There was, however, a significant study-adjusted benefit in elective coronary artery bypass surgery patients in terms of renal replacement therapy (Bicarbonate vs. Control, OR: 0.38 [99% CI: 0.25-0.58], P < 0.0001) and the development of an Acute Kidney Injury Network grade = 3 (Bicarbonate vs. Control, OR: 0.45 [99% CI: 0.43-0.48], P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Urinary alkalinization using sodium bicarbonate infusion is not associated with an overall lower incidence of AKI; however, it reduces severe AKI and need for renal replacement therapy in elective coronary artery bypass patients.

AB  - Background: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a common complication of cirrhosis characterized by single or multiple organ failures and high short-term mortality. Treatment of ACLF consists of standard medical care (SMC) and organ(s) support. Whether the efficacy of artificial liver support (ALS) depends on the severity of ACLF or on the intensity of this treatment, or both, is unclear. This study aimed to further assess these issues. Methods: We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis assessing the efficacy of Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) in ACLF patients enrolled in prior randomized control trials (RCTs). The meta-analysis was designed to assess the effect of patient severity (ACLF grade) and treatment intensity [low-intensity therapy (LIT), SMC alone or SMC plus 4 MARS sessions, high-intensity therapy (HIT), SMC plus > 4 MARS sessions] on mortality. Results: Three RCTs suitable for the meta-analysis (n = 285, ACLF patients = 165) were identified in a systematic review. SMC plus MARS (irrespective of the number of sessions) did not improve survival compared with SMC alone, neither in the complete population nor in the ACLF patients. Survival, however, was significantly improved in the subgroup of patients receiving HIT both in the entire cohort (10-day survival: 98.6% versus 82.8%, p = 0.001; 30-day survival: 73.9% versus 64.3%, p = 0.032) and within the ACLF patients (10-day survival: 97.8% versus 78.6%, p = 0.001; 30-day survival: 73.3% versus 58.5%, p = 0.041). Remarkably, HIT increased survival independently of ACLF grade. Independent predictors of survival were age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), ACLF grade, number of MARS sessions received, and intensity of MARS therapy. Conclusion: HIT with albumin dialysis may improve survival in patients with ACLF. Appropriate treatment schedules should be determined in future clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RTCGM) may help in the management of individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM); however, the evidence supporting its use is unclear. The available meta-analyses on this topic use aggregate data which weaken inference. OBJECTIVE: Individual patient data were obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to conduct a meta-analysis and synthesize evidence about the effect of RTCGM on glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), hypoglycaemic events and time spent in hypoglycaemia in T1DM. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus through January 2015. We included RCTs that enrolled individuals with T1DM and compared RTCGM vs control group. A two-step regression model was used to pool individual patient data. RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs at moderate risk of bias. Meta-analysis suggests that the use of RTCGM is associated with a statistically significant but modest reduction in HbA1c (-0.276; 95% confidence interval -0.465 to -0.087). The improvements in HbA1c were primarily seen in individuals over age 15 years. We were unable to identify a statistically significant difference in time spent in hypoglycaemia or the number of hypoglycaemic episodes although these analyses were imprecise and warrant lower confidence. There was no difference between males and females. CONCLUSION: RTCGM in T1DM is associated with a reduction in HbA1c primarily in individuals over 15 years of age. We were unable to identify a statistically significant difference in the time spent in hypoglycaemia or the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to quantify the efficacy of cervical cerclage in preventing preterm birth (PTB) in asymptomatic singleton pregnancies with a short mid-trimester cervical length (CL) on transvaginal sonography (TVS) and without prior spontaneous PTB. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from inception of each database until February 2017. No language restrictions were applied. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of asymptomatic singleton pregnancies without prior spontaneous PTB, found to have short CL < 25 mm on mid-trimester TVS and then randomized to management with either cerclage or no cerclage, were included. Corresponding authors of all the included trials were contacted to obtain access to the data and perform a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data. Data provided by the investigators were merged into a master database constructed specifically for the review. Primary outcome was PTB < 35 weeks. Summary measures were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% CI. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Five RCTs, including 419 asymptomatic singleton gestations with TVS-CL < 25 mm and without prior spontaneous PTB, were analyzed. In women who were randomized to the cerclage group compared with those in the control group, no statistically significant differences were found in PTB < 35 (21.9% vs 27.7%; RR, 0.88 (95% CI 0.63-1.23); I(2) = 0%; five studies, 419 participants), < 34, < 32, < 28 and < 24 weeks, gestational age at delivery, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) and neonatal outcomes. In women who received cerclage compared with those who did not, planned subgroup analyses revealed a significantly lower rate of PTB < 35 weeks in women with TVS-CL < 10 mm (39.5% vs 58.0%; RR, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.47-0.98); I(2) = 0%; five studies; 126 participants) and in women who received tocolytics (17.5% vs 32.7%; RR, 0.54 (95% CI, 0.31-0.93); I(2) = 0%; four studies; 169 participants) or antibiotics (18.3% vs 31.5%; RR, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.33-0.98); I(2) = 0%; three studies; 163 participants) as additional therapy to cerclage. The quality of evidence was downgraded two levels because of serious imprecision and indirectness, and therefore was judged as low. CONCLUSIONS: In singleton gestations without prior spontaneous PTB but with TVS-CL < 25 mm in the second trimester, cerclage does not seem to prevent preterm delivery or improve neonatal outcome. However, in these pregnancies, cerclage seems to be efficacious at lower CLs, such as < 10 mm, and when tocolytics or antibiotics are used as additional therapy, requiring further studies in these subgroups. Given the low quality of evidence, further well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm the findings of this study. Copyright (c) 2017 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cervical length screening by transvaginal sonography (TVS) has been shown to be a good predictive test for spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) in symptomatic singleton pregnancy with threatened preterm labor (PTL). The aim of this review and meta-analysis of individual participant data was to evaluate the effect of knowledge of the TVS cervical length (CL) in preventing PTB in singleton pregnancies presenting with threatened PTL. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Trials Register (May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria included randomized controlled trials of singleton gestations with threatened PTL randomized to management based mainly on CL screening (intervention group), or CL screening with no knowledge of results or no CL screening (control group). Participants included women with singleton gestations at 23 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks with threatened PTL. We contacted corresponding authors of included trials to request access to the data and perform a meta-analysis of individual participant data. Data provided by the investigators were merged into a master database constructed specifically for the review. The primary outcome was PTB < 37 weeks. Summary measures were reported as relative risk (RR) or as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. RESULTS: Three trials including a total of 287 singleton gestations with threatened PTL between 24 + 0 and 35 + 6 weeks were included in the meta-analysis, of which 145 were randomized to CL screening with knowledge of results and 142 to no knowledge of CL. Compared with the control group, women who were randomized to the known CL group had a significantly lower rate of PTB < 37 weeks (22.1% vs 34.5%; RR, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.44-0.94); three trials; 287 participants) and a later gestational age at delivery (MD, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.03-1.25) weeks; MD, 4.48 (95% CI, 1.18-8.98) days; three trials; 287 participants). All other outcomes for which there were available data were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association between knowledge of TVS CL and lower incidence of PTB and later gestational age at delivery in symptomatic singleton gestations with threatened PTL. Given that in the meta-analysis we found a significant 36% reduction in the primary outcome, but other outcomes were mostly statistically similar, further study needs to be undertaken to understand better whether the predictive characteristics of CL screening by TVS can be translated into better clinical management and therefore better outcomes and under what circumstances.

CRIBADO MEDIANTE LA LONGITUD CERVICAL PARA LA PREVENCION DEL PARTO PRETERMINO EN EMBARAZOS CON FETO UNICO Y RIESGO DE PARTO PREMATURO: REVISION SISTEMATICA Y METAANALISIS DE ENSAYOS CONTROLADOS ALEATORIZADOS HACIENDO USO DE LOS DATOS INDIVIDUALES DE LAS PACIENTES: RESUMEN OBJETIVO: El cribado mediante la longitud cervical obtenida con ecografia transvaginal (ETV) ha demostrado ser una buena prueba para la prediccion del parto pretermino espontaneo (PPTE) en embarazos con feto unico sintomaticos debido a la amenaza de parto pretermino (PPT). El objetivo de esta revision y metaanalisis de los datos de participantes individuales fue evaluar el efecto de medir la longitud cervical (LC) mediante ETV con el fin de prevenir el parto prematuro en embarazos unicos con amenaza de PPT. METODOS: Se realizaron busquedas en los ficheros de ensayos de Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group y Complementary Medicine Field (mayo de 2016), y en las listas de referencias de los estudios encontrados. Los criterios de seleccion incluyeron ensayos controlados aleatorizados de embarazos con feto unico y riesgo de PPT con aleatorizacion de la paciente basada principalmente en el cribado mediante la LC (grupo de intervencion), el cribado mediante la LC sin conocimiento de los resultados, o sin cribado de LC (grupo de control). Las participantes fueron mujeres embarazadas con feto unico desde las 23 + 0 hasta las 36 + 6 semanas y con riesgo de PPT. Se establecio contacto con los autores de los ensayos incluidos para solicitar el acceso a los datos y llevar a cabo un metaanalisis de los datos de las participantes individualmente. Los datos proporcionados por los investigadores se agregaron a una base de datos maestra creada especificamente para esta revision. El resultado primario fue el PPTE < 37 semanas. Las medidas resumen se reportaron como riesgo relativo (RR) o como diferencia de medias (DM) con IC del 95%. RESULTADOS: En el metaanalisis se incluyeron tres ensayos con un total de 287 embarazos con feto unico y riesgo de PPT entre 24 + 0 y 35 + 6 semanas, de los cuales 145 fueron asignados al azar a un cribado mediante la LC con conocimiento de los resultados y 142 a aquellos para los que se desconocia la LC. En comparacion con el grupo control, las mujeres que fueron asignadas aleatoriamente al grupo en el que se conocia la LC tuvieron una tasa de parto prematuro a < 37 semanas significativamente menor (22,1% vs. 34,5%; RR 0,64 (IC 95%, 0,44-0,94); 3 ensayos; 287 participantes ) y una edad gestacional al momento del parto mas tardia (DM 0,64 (IC 95%, 0.03-1.25) semanas; DM 4,48 (IC 95%, 1,18-8,98) dias; 3 ensayos; 287 participantes). El resto de los resultados para los cuales habia datos disponibles fueron similares en ambos grupos. CONCLUSIONES: Existe una asociacion significativa entre el conocimiento de la LC obtenida mediante ETV y una menor incidencia de PPTE y edad gestacional mas tardia en el momento del parto en embarazos con feto unico sintomaticos debido al riesgo de parto pretermino (PPT). Teniendo en cuenta que en el metaanalisis se encontro una reduccion significativa del 36% en el resultado primario, pero que los otros resultados fueron estadisticamente similares en su mayoria, seran necesarios mas estudios para entender mejor si las propiedades predictivas del cribado mediante la LC obtenida con ETV se pueden traducir en una mejor atencion clinica y por lo tanto mejores resultados dependiendo de las circunstancias. :META: : ,(preterm labor,PTL),(transvaginal sonography,TVS)(spontaneous preterm birth,PTB)metaPTL,TVS(cervical length,CL)PTB : CochraneCochrane(20165)PTL,CL()CLCL()23 + 036+6PTL,,meta37PTB(relative risk,RR)95%CI(mean difference,MD) : meta3,28724 + 035+6PTL,145CL,142CL,CL37PTB[22.1%34.5%;RR,0.64(95% CI,0.44 ~ 0.94);3;287],[MD,0.64(95% CI,0.03 ~ 1.25);MD,4.48(95% CI,1.18 ~ 8.98);3;287]2, : PTL,TVS CLPTBmeta36%,,,TVSCL,.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of exercise interventions on sleep disturbances and sleep quality in patients with mixed cancer diagnoses, and identify demographic, clinical, and intervention-related moderators of these effects. METHODS: Individual patient data (IPD) and aggregated meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Using data from the Predicting OptimaL cAncer RehabIlitation and Supportive care project, IPD of 2173 adults (mean age=54.8) with cancer from 17 RCTs were analyzed. A complementary systematic search was conducted (until November 2018) to study the overall effects and test the representativeness of analyzed IPD. Effect sizes of exercise effects on self-reported sleep outcomes were calculated for all included RCTs. Linear mixed-effect models were used to evaluate the effects of exercise on post-intervention outcome values, adjusting for baseline values. Moderator effects were studied by testing interactions for demographic, clinical and intervention-related characteristics. RESULTS: For all 27 eligible RCTs from the updated search, exercise interventions significantly decreased sleep disturbances in adults with cancer (g=-0.09, 95% CI [-0.16; -0.02]). No significant effect was obtained for sleep quality. RCTs included in IPD analyses constituted a representative sample of the published literature. The intervention effects on sleep disturbances were not significantly moderated by any demographic, clinical, or intervention-related factor, nor by sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides some evidence that, compared to control conditions, exercise interventions may improve sleep disturbances, but not sleep quality, in cancer patients, although this effect is of a small magnitude. Among the investigated variables, none was found to significantly moderate the effect of exercise interventions on sleep disturbances.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypertensive disorders affect 3-10% of pregnancies. Delayed delivery carries maternal risks, while early delivery increases fetal risk, so appropriate timing is important. The aim of this study was to compare immediate delivery with expectant management for prevention of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with hypertensive disease in pregnancy. METHODS: CENTRAL, PubMed, MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing immediate delivery to expectant management in women presenting with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia without severe features from 34 weeks of gestation. The primary neonatal outcome was respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and the primary maternal outcome was a composite of HELLP syndrome and eclampsia. The PRISMA-IPD guideline was followed and a two-stage meta-analysis approach was used. Relative risks (RR) and numbers needed to treat or harm (NNT/NNH) with 95% CI were calculated to evaluate the effect of the intervention. RESULTS: Main outcomes were available for 1724 eligible women. Compared with expectant management, immediate delivery reduced the composite risk of HELLP syndrome and eclampsia in all women (0.8% vs 2.8%; RR, 0.33 (95% CI, 0.15-0.73); I(2) = 0%; NNT, 51 (95% CI, 31.1-139.3)) as well as in the pre-eclampsia subgroup (1.1% vs 3.5%; RR, 0.39 (95% CI, 0.15-0.98); I(2) = 0%). Immediate delivery increased RDS risk (3.4% vs 1.6%; RR, 1.94 (95% CI 1.05-3.6); I(2) = 24%; NNH, 58 (95% CI, 31.1-363.1)), but depended upon gestational age. Immediate delivery in the 35(th) week of gestation increased RDS risk (5.1% vs 0.6%; RR, 5.5 (95% CI, 1.0-29.6); I(2) = 0%), but immediate delivery in the 36(th) week did not (1.5% vs 0.4%; RR, 3.4 (95% CI, 0.4-30.3); I(2) not applicable). CONCLUSION: In women with hypertension in pregnancy, immediate delivery reduces the risk of maternal complications, whilst the effect on the neonate depends on gestational age. Specifically, women with a-priori higher risk of progression to HELLP, such as those already presenting with pre-eclampsia instead of gestational hypertension, were shown to benefit from earlier delivery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but the effect of vitamin D supplementation on markers of vascular function associated with major adverse cardiovascular events is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a systematic review and individual participant meta-analysis to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, central blood pressure, microvascular function, and reactive hyperemia index. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov were searched until the end of 2016 without language restrictions. Placebo-controlled randomized trials of at least 4 weeks duration were included. Individual participant data were sought from investigators on included trials. Trial-level meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models; individual participant meta-analyses used a 2-stage analytic strategy, examining effects in prespecified subgroups. 31 trials (2751 participants) were included; 29 trials (2641 participants) contributed data to trial-level meta-analysis, and 24 trials (2051 participants) contributed to individual-participant analyses. Vitamin D3 daily dose equivalents ranged from 900 to 5000 IU; duration was 4 weeks to 12 months. Trial-level meta-analysis showed no significant effect of supplementation on macrovascular measures (flow-mediated dilatation, 0.37% [95% confidence interval, -0.23 to 0.97]; carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, 0.00 m/s [95% confidence interval, -0.36 to 0.37]); similar results were obtained from individual participant data. Microvascular function showed a modest improvement in trial-level data only. No consistent benefit was observed in subgroup analyses or between different vitamin D analogues. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on most markers of vascular function in this analysis.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Low levels of vitamin D are associated with elevated blood pressure (BP) and future cardiovascular events. Whether vitamin D supplementation reduces BP and which patient characteristics predict a response remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review whether supplementation with vitamin D or its analogues reduce BP. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and http://www.ClinicalTrials.com augmented by a hand search of references from the included articles and previous reviews. Google was searched for gray literature (ie, material not published in recognized scientific journals). No language restrictions were applied. The search period spanned January 1, 1966, through March 31, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that used vitamin D supplementation for a minimum of 4 weeks for any indication and reported BP data. Studies were included if they used active or inactive forms of vitamin D or vitamin D analogues. Cointerventions were permitted if identical in all treatment arms. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We extracted data on baseline demographics, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), and change in BP from baseline to the final follow-up. Individual patient data on age, sex, medication use, diabetes mellitus, baseline and follow-up BP, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were requested from the authors of the included studies. For trial-level data, between-group differences in BP change were combined in a random-effects model. For individual patient data, between-group differences in BP at the final follow up, adjusted for baseline BP, were calculated before combining in a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Difference in SBP and DBP measured in an office setting. RESULTS: We included 46 trials (4541 participants) in the trial-level meta-analysis. Individual patient data were obtained for 27 trials (3092 participants). At the trial level, no effect of vitamin D supplementation was seen on SBP (effect size, 0.0 [95% CI, -0.8 to 0.8] mm Hg; P=.97; I2=21%) or DBP (effect size, -0.1 [95% CI, -0.6 to 0.5] mm Hg; P=.84; I2=20%). Similar results were found analyzing individual patient data for SBP (effect size, -0.5 [95% CI, -1.3 to 0.4] mm Hg; P=.27; I2=0%) and DBP (effect size, 0.2 [95% CI, -0.3 to 0.7] mm Hg; P=.38; I2=0%). Subgroup analysis did not reveal any baseline factor predictive of a better response to therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vitamin D supplementation is ineffective as an agent for lowering BP and thus should not be used as an antihypertensive agent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Two recent randomised trials studied the benefit of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) irrespective or in absence of heart failure. The studies were both undersized to assess hard clinical endpoints. A pooled analysis was preplanned by the steering committees. METHODS: We conducted a prespecified meta-analysis of patient-level data of patients with STEMI recruited in two multicentre superiority trials, randomised within 72 hours after symptom onset. Patients were allocated (1:1) to two MRA regimens: (1) an intravenous bolus of potassium canrenoate (200 mg) followed by oral spironolactone (25 mg once daily) versus standard therapy or (2) oral eplerenone (25-50 mg) versus placebo. The primary and key secondary outcomes, all-cause death and the composite of all-cause death or resuscitated sudden death, respectively, were assessed in the intention-to-treat population using a Cox model stratified on the study identifier. RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive (n=1118) or not the MRA regimen (n=1123). After a median follow-up time of 188 days, the primary and secondary outcomes occurred in 5 (0.4%) and 17 (1.5%) patients (adjusted HR (adjHR) 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.86, p=0.03) and 6 (0.5%) and 22 (2%) patients (adjHR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.65, p=0.004) in the MRA and control groups, respectively. There were also trends towards lower rates of cardiovascular death (p=0.06) and ventricular fibrillation (p=0.08) in the MRA group. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that compared with standard therapy, MRA regimens are associated with a reduction of death and death or resuscitated sudden death in STEMI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral anticoagulation treatment (OAT) resumption is a therapeutic dilemma in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) care, particularly for lobar hemorrhages related to amyloid angiopathy. We sought to determine whether OAT resumption after ICH is associated with long-term outcome, accounting for ICH location (ie, lobar vs nonlobar). METHODS: We meta-analyzed individual patient data from: (1) the multicenter RETRACE study (n = 542), (2) a U.S.-based single-center ICH study (n = 261), and (3) the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage study (n = 209). We determined whether, within 1 year from ICH, OAT resumption was associated with: (1) mortality, (2) favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale = 0-3), and (3) stroke incidence. We separately analyzed nonlobar and lobar ICH cases using propensity score matching and Cox regression models. RESULTS: We included 1,012 OAT-related ICH survivors (633 nonlobar and 379 lobar). Among nonlobar ICH survivors, 178/633 (28%) resumed OAT, whereas 86/379 (23%) lobar ICH survivors did. In multivariate analyses, OAT resumption after nonlobar ICH was associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.14-0.44, p < 0.0001) and improved functional outcome (HR = 4.22, 95% CI = 2.57-6.94, p < 0.0001). OAT resumption after lobar ICH was also associated with decreased mortality (HR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.17-0.45, p < 0.0001) and favorable functional outcome (HR = 4.08, 95% CI = 2.48-6.72, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, OAT resumption was associated with decreased all-cause stroke incidence in both lobar and nonlobar ICH (both p < 0.01). INTERPRETATION: These results suggest novel evidence of an association between OAT resumption and outcome following ICH, regardless of hematoma location. These findings support conducting randomized trials to explore risks and benefits of OAT resumption after ICH. Ann Neurol 2017;82:755-765.

AB  - Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) refers to a family of interventions targeting substance-related cognitive biases, which have been found to play a role in the maintenance of addictive behaviors. In this study, we conducted a Bayesian meta-analysis of individual patient data from studies investigating the effects of CBM as a behavior change intervention for the treatment of alcohol and tobacco use disorders, in individuals aware of the behavior change goal of the studies. Main outcomes included reduction in the targeted cognitive biases after the intervention and in substance use or relapse rate at the short-to-long term follow-up. Additional moderators, both at the study-level (type of addiction and CBM training) and at the participant-level (amount of completed training trials, severity of substance use), were progressively included in a series of hierarchical mixed-effects models. We included 14 studies involving 2435 participants. CBM appeared to have a small effect on cognitive bias (0.23, 95% credible interval = 0.06-0.41) and relapse rate (-0.27, 95% credible interval = -0.68 - 0.22), but not on reduction of substance use. Increased training practice showed a paradoxical moderation effect on relapse, with a relatively lower chance of relapse in the control condition with increased practice, compared to the training condition. All effects were associated with extremely wide 95% credible intervals, which indicate the absence of enough evidence in favor or against a reliable effect of CBM on cognitive bias and relapse rate in alcohol and tobacco use disorders. Besides the need for a larger body of evidence, research on the topic would benefit from a stronger adherence to the current methodological standards in randomized controlled trial design and the systematic investigation of shared protocols of CBM.

AB  - In the Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-term Evaluation (SMILE) 1, 3, and 4 studies, early administration of zofenopril in acute myocardial infarction showed to be prognostically beneficial versus placebo or ramipril. The SMILE-2 showed that both zofenopril and lisinopril are safe and showed no significant differences in the incidence of major cardiovascular (CV) complications. In this pooled analysis of individual data of the SMILE studies, we evaluated whether the superior efficacy of zofenopril is maintained also in patients with >/=1 CV risk factor (CV+, n = 2962) as compared to CV- (n = 668). The primary study end point was set to 1-year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes. The risk of CV events was significantly reduced with zofenopril versus placebo either in the CV+ (-37%; hazard ratio: 0.63; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.78; P = 0.0001) or in the CV- group (-55%; hazard ratio: 0.45; 0.26-0.78; P = 0.004). Also, the other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced the risk of major CV outcomes, though the reduction was not statistically significant versus placebo (CV+: 0.78; 0.58-1.05; P = 0.107; CV-: 0.71; 0.36-1.41; P = 0.334). The benefit was larger in patients treated with zofenopril than other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with a statistically significant difference for CV+ (0.79; 0.63-0.99; P = 0.039) versus CV- (0.62; 0.37-1.06; P = 0.081). In conclusion, zofenopril administered to patients after acute myocardial infarction has a positive impact on prognosis, regardless of the patient's CV risk profile.

AB  - This meta-analysis combines the results of nine ischemic stroke trials, assessing efficacy of Cerebrolysin on global neurological improvement during early post-stroke period. Cerebrolysin is a parenterally administered neuropeptide preparation approved for treatment of stroke. All included studies had a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The patients were treated with 30-50 ml Cerebrolysin once daily for 10-21 days, with treatment initiation within 72 h after onset of ischemic stroke. For five studies, original analysis data were available for meta-analysis (individual patient data analysis); for four studies, aggregate data were used. The combination by meta-analytic procedures was pre-planned and the methods of synthesis were pre-defined under blinded conditions. Search deadline for the present meta-analysis was December 31, 2016. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney (MW) effect size for National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on day 30 (or 21), combining the results of nine randomized, controlled trials by means of the robust Wei-Lachin pooling procedure (maximin-efficient robust test), indicated superiority of Cerebrolysin as compared with placebo (MW 0.60, P < 0.0001, N = 1879). The combined number needed to treat for clinically relevant changes in early NIHSS was 7.7 (95% CI 5.2 to 15.0). The additional full-scale ordinal analysis of modified Rankin Scale at day 90 in moderate to severe patients resulted in MW 0.61 with statistical significance in favor of Cerebrolysin (95% CI 0.52 to 0.69, P = 0.0118, N = 314). Safety aspects were comparable to placebo. Our meta-analysis confirms previous evidence that Cerebrolysin has a beneficial effect on early global neurological deficits in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

AB  - A recent individual patient data meta-analysis showed that antidepressant medication is slightly more efficacious than cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing overall depression severity in patients with a DSM-defined depressive disorder. We used an update of that dataset, based on seventeen randomized clinical trials, to examine the comparative efficacy of antidepressant medication vs. CBT in more detail by focusing on individual depressive symptoms as assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Five symptoms (i.e., "depressed mood" , "feelings of guilt" , "suicidal thoughts" , "psychic anxiety" and "general somatic symptoms") showed larger improvements in the medication compared to the CBT condition (effect sizes ranging from .13 to .16), whereas no differences were found for the twelve other symptoms. In addition, network estimation techniques revealed that all effects, except that on "depressed mood" , were direct and could not be explained by any of the other direct or indirect treatment effects. Exploratory analyses showed that information about the symptom-specific efficacy could help in identifying those patients who, based on their pre-treatment symptomatology, are likely to benefit more from antidepressant medication than from CBT (effect size of .30) versus those for whom both treatments are likely to be equally efficacious. Overall, our symptom-oriented approach results in a more thorough evaluation of the efficacy of antidepressant medication over CBT and shows potential in "precision psychiatry" .

AB  - Importance: Reperfusion is a key factor for clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for large-vessel intracranial occlusion. However, data are scarce on the association between the time from onset and reperfusion results. Objective: To analyze the rate of reperfusion after EVT started at different intervals after symptom onset in patients with AIS. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 7 randomized trials of the Highly Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices (HERMES) group. This is a multicenter cohort study of the intervention arm of randomized clinical trials included in the HERMES group. Patients with anterior circulation AIS who underwent EVT for M1/M2 or intracranial carotid artery occlusion were included. Each trial enrolled patients according to its specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data on patients eligible but not enrolled (eg, refusals or exclusions) were not available. All analyses were performed by the HERMES biostatistical core laboratory using the pooled database. Data were analyzed between December 2010 and April 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: Successful reperfusion was defined as a modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b/3 at the end of the EVT procedure adjusted for age, occlusion location, pretreatment intravenous thrombolysis, and clot burden score and was analyzed in relation to different intervals (onset, emergency department arrival, imaging, and puncture) using mixed-methods logistic regression. Results: Among the 728 included patients, with a mean (SD) age of 65.4 (13.5) years and of whom 345 were female (47.4%), decreases in rates of successful reperfusion defined as a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b/3 were observed with increasing time from admission or first imaging to groin puncture. The magnitude of effect was a 22% relative reduction (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95) per additional hour between admission and puncture and a 26% relative reduction (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.93) per additional hour between imaging and puncture. Conclusions and Relevance: Because the probability of reperfusion declined significantly with time between hospital arrival and groin puncture, we provide additional arguments for minimizing the intervals after symptom onset in anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with rectal cancer after preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and surgery is uncertain. We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data to compare adjuvant chemotherapy with observation for patients with rectal cancer. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, and conference abstracts to identify European randomised, controlled, phase 3 trials comparing observation with adjuvant chemotherapy after preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and surgery for patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer. The primary endpoint of interest was overall survival. FINDINGS: We analysed data from four eligible trials, including data from 1196 patients with (y)pTNM stage II or III disease, who had an R0 resection, had a low anterior resection or an abdominoperineal resection, and had a tumour located within 15 cm of the anal verge. We found no significant differences in overall survival between patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and those who underwent observation (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.81-1.17; p=0.775); there were no significant differences in overall survival in subgroup analyses. Overall, adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve disease-free survival (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77-1.07; p=0.230) or distant recurrences (0.94, 0.78-1.14; p=0.523) compared with observation. However, in subgroup analyses, patients with a tumour 10-15 cm from the anal verge had improved disease-free survival (0.59, 0.40-0.85; p=0.005, p(interaction)=0.107) and fewer distant recurrences (0.61, 0.40-0.94; p=0.025, p(interaction)=0.126) when treated with adjuvant chemotherapy compared with patients undergoing observation. INTERPRETATION: Overall, adjuvant fluorouracil-based chemotherapy did not improve overall survival, disease-free survival, or distant recurrences. However, adjuvant chemotherapy might benefit patients with a tumour 10-15 cm from the anal verge in terms of disease-free survival and distant recurrence. Further studies of preoperative and postoperative treatment for this subgroup of patients are warranted. FUNDING: None.

AB  - Background: Our aim was to evaluate the benefits and harms of adjunctive corticosteroids in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using individual patient data from randomized, placebo-controlled trials and to explore subgroup differences. Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central, and trial registers (all through July 2017). Data from 1506 individual patients in 6 trials were analyzed using uniform outcome definitions. We investigated prespecified effect modifiers using multivariable hierarchical regression, adjusting for pneumonia severity, age, and clustering effects. Results: Within 30 days of randomization, 37 of 748 patients (5.0%) assigned to corticosteroids and 45 of 758 patients (5.9%) assigned to placebo died (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], .46 to 1.21; P &#x003D; .24). Time to clinical stability and length of hospital stay were reduced by approximately 1 day with corticosteroids (-1.03 days; 95% CI, -1.62 to -.43; P &#x003D; .001 and -1.15 days; 95% CI, -1.75 to -.55; P < .001, respectively). More patients with corticosteroids had hyperglycemia (160 [22.1%] vs 88 [12.0%]; aOR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.60 to 2.90; P < .001) and CAP-related rehospitalization (33 [5.0%] vs 18 [2.7%]; aOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.32; P &#x003D; .04). We did not find significant effect modification by CAP severity or degree of inflammation. Conclusions: Adjunct corticosteroids for patients hospitalized with CAP reduce time to clinical stability and length of hospital stay by approximately 1 day without a significant effect on overall mortality but with an increased risk for CAP-related rehospitalization and hyperglycemia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Blood Pressure (ACCORD-BP) study did not find a significant beneficial effect of intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering on cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) did find a significant beneficial effect in patients without T2DM. The objective of this analysis was to assess the effect of both T2DM and baseline cardiovascular disease risk on the treatment effect of intensive blood pressure lowering. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The individual patient data from the ACCORD-BP and SPRINT studies were pooled and follow-up durations harmonized. Both studies randomized hypertensive patients to an SBP target of <120 mmHg or a target of <140 mmHg. The composite primary end point consisted of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular death. The interaction between intensive blood pressure lowering and both T2DM and 10-year cardiovascular risk was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 14,094 patients with mean age 66 +/- 8.9 years and mean baseline SBP 139.5 +/- 15.6 mmHg; 33.6% had T2DM. The hazard ratio for the primary composite end point was 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.93), P = 0.0017. The interaction between intensive blood pressure lowering and T2DM was nonsignificant (P = 0.13). The 10-year cardiovascular risk was higher in primary prevention patients with T2DM, but risk did not interact with the treatment effect (P = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive blood pressure lowering may have a similar favorable effect and appears to decrease cardiovascular events in both patients with and patients without T2DM.

AB  - We sought to examine the relation between sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis for contrast-associated nephropathy (CAN) and mortality. We conducted an individual patient data meta-analysis from multiple randomized controlled trials. We obtained individual patient data sets for 7 of 10 eligible trials (2,292 of 2,764 participants). For the remaining 3 trials, time-to-event data were imputed based on follow-up periods described in their original reports. We included all trials that compared periprocedural intravenous sodium bicarbonate to periprocedural intravenous sodium chloride in patients undergoing coronary angiography or other intra-arterial interventions. Included trials were determined by consensus according to predefined eligibility criteria. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality hazard, defined as time from randomization to death. In 10 trials with a total of 2,764 participants, sodium bicarbonate was associated with lower mortality hazard than sodium chloride at 1 year (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41 to 0.89, p = 0.011). Although periprocedural sodium bicarbonate was associated with a reduction in the incidence of CAN (relative risk 0.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.91, p = 0.003), there exists a statistically significant interaction between the effect on mortality and the occurrence of CAN (hazard ratio 5.65, 95% CI 3.58 to 8.92, p <0.001) for up to 1-year mortality. Periprocedural intravenous sodium bicarbonate seems to be associated with a reduction in long-term mortality in patients undergoing coronary angiography or other intra-arterial interventions.

AB  - AIMS: Previous analyses suggest that heart failure (HF) therapy guided by (N-terminal pro-)brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) might be dependent on left ventricular ejection fraction, age and co-morbidities, but the reasons remain unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine interactions between (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy and HF with reduced [ejection fraction (EF) </=45%; HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), n = 1731] vs. preserved EF [EF > 45%; HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), n = 301] and co-morbidities (hypertension, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular insult, peripheral vascular disease) on outcome, individual patient data (n = 2137) from eight NT-proBNP guidance trials were analysed using Cox-regression with multiplicative interaction terms. Endpoints were mortality and admission because of HF. Whereas in HFrEF patients (NT-pro)BNP-guided compared with symptom-guided therapy resulted in lower mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.97, P = 0.03] and fewer HF admissions (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.97, P = 0.02), no such effect was seen in HFpEF (mortality: HR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.76-1.96, P = 0.41; HF admissions HR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.67-1.53, P = 0.97; interactions P < 0.02). Age (74 +/- 11 years) interacted with treatment strategy allocation independently of EF regarding mortality (P = 0.02), but not HF admission (P = 0.54). The interaction of age and mortality was explained by the interaction of treatment strategy allocation with co-morbidities. In HFpEF, renal failure provided strongest interaction (P < 0.01; increased risk of (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy if renal failure present), whereas in HFrEF patients, the presence of at least two of the following co-morbidities provided strongest interaction (P < 0.01; (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy beneficial only if none or one of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular insult, or peripheral vascular disease present). (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy was harmful in HFpEF patients without hypertension (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The benefits of therapy guided by (NT-pro)BNP were present in HFrEF only. Co-morbidities seem to influence the response to (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy and may explain the lower efficacy of this approach in elderly patients.

AB  - Background: Exercise effects in cancer patients often appear modest, possibly because interventions rarely target patients most in need. This study investigated the moderator effects of baseline values on the exercise outcomes of fatigue, aerobic fitness, muscle strength, quality of life (QoL), and self-reported physical function (PF) in cancer patients during and post-treatment. Methods: Individual patient data from 34 randomized exercise trials (n = 4519) were pooled. Linear mixed-effect models were used to study moderator effects of baseline values on exercise intervention outcomes and to determine whether these moderator effects differed by intervention timing (during vs post-treatment). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Moderator effects of baseline fatigue and PF were consistent across intervention timing, with greater effects in patients with worse fatigue (Pinteraction = .05) and worse PF (Pinteraction = .003). Moderator effects of baseline aerobic fitness, muscle strength, and QoL differed by intervention timing. During treatment, effects on aerobic fitness were greater for patients with better baseline aerobic fitness (Pinteraction = .002). Post-treatment, effects on upper (Pinteraction < .001) and lower (Pinteraction = .01) body muscle strength and QoL (Pinteraction < .001) were greater in patients with worse baseline values. Conclusion: Although exercise should be encouraged for most cancer patients during and post-treatments, targeting specific subgroups may be especially beneficial and cost effective. For fatigue and PF, interventions during and post-treatment should target patients with high fatigue and low PF. During treatment, patients experience benefit for muscle strength and QoL regardless of baseline values; however, only patients with low baseline values benefit post-treatment. For aerobic fitness, patients with low baseline values do not appear to benefit from exercise during treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent positive randomized trials of endovascular therapy for ischemic stroke used predominantly stent retrievers. We pooled data to investigate the efficacy and safety of stent thrombectomy using the Solitaire device in anterior circulation ischemic stroke. METHODS: Patient-level data were pooled from trials in which the Solitaire was the only or the predominant device used in a prespecified meta-analysis (SEER Collaboration): Solitaire FR With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment (SWIFT PRIME), Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE), Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological Deficits-Intra-Arterial (EXTEND-IA), and Randomized Trial of Revascularization With Solitaire FR Device Versus Best Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke Due to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Presenting Within Eight Hours of Symptom Onset (REVASCAT). The primary outcome was ordinal analysis of modified Rankin Score at 90 days. The primary analysis included all patients in the 4 trials with 2 sensitivity analyses: (1) excluding patients in whom Solitaire was not the first device used and (2) including the 3 Solitaire-only trials (excluding ESCAPE). Secondary outcomes included functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0-2), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and mortality. RESULTS: The primary analysis included 787 patients: 401 randomized to endovascular thrombectomy and 386 to standard care, and 82.6% received intravenous thrombolysis. The common odds ratio for modified Rankin Score improvement was 2.7 (2.0-3.5) with no heterogeneity in effect by age, sex, baseline stroke severity, extent of computed tomography changes, site of occlusion, or pretreatment with alteplase. The number needed to treat to reduce disability was 2.5 and for an extra patient to achieve independent outcome was 4.25 (3.29-5.99). Successful revascularization occurred in 77% treated with Solitaire device. The rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and overall mortality did not differ between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Solitaire thrombectomy for large vessel ischemic stroke was safe and highly effective with substantially reduced disability. Benefits were consistent in all prespecified subgroups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke thrombolysis with alteplase is currently recommended 0-4.5 h after stroke onset. We aimed to determine whether perfusion imaging can identify patients with salvageable brain tissue with symptoms 4.5 h or more from stroke onset or with symptoms on waking who might benefit from thrombolysis. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data, we searched PubMed for randomised trials published in English between Jan 1, 2006, and March 1, 2019. We also reviewed the reference list of a previous systematic review of thrombolysis and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for interventional studies of ischaemic stroke. Studies of alteplase versus placebo in patients (aged >/=18 years) with ischaemic stroke treated more than 4.5 h after onset, or with wake-up stroke, who were imaged with perfusion-diffusion MRI or CT perfusion were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-1) at 3 months, adjusted for baseline age and clinical severity. Safety outcomes were death and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. We calculated odds ratios, adjusted for baseline age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, using mixed-effects logistic regression models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019128036. FINDINGS: We identified three trials that met eligibility criteria: EXTEND, ECASS4-EXTEND, and EPITHET. Of the 414 patients included in the three trials, 213 (51%) were assigned to receive alteplase and 201 (49%) were assigned to receive placebo. Overall, 211 patients in the alteplase group and 199 patients in the placebo group had mRS assessment data at 3 months and thus were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. 76 (36%) of 211 patients in the alteplase group and 58 (29%) of 199 patients in the placebo group had achieved excellent functional outcome at 3 months (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.86, 95% CI 1.15-2.99, p=0.011). Symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage was more common in the alteplase group than the placebo group (ten [5%] of 213 patients vs one [<1%] of 201 patients in the placebo group; adjusted OR 9.7, 95% CI 1.23-76.55, p=0.031). 29 (14%) of 213 patients in the alteplase group and 18 (9%) of 201 patients in the placebo group died (adjusted OR 1.55, 0.81-2.96, p=0.66). INTERPRETATION: Patients with ischaemic stroke 4.5-9 h from stroke onset or wake-up stroke with salvageable brain tissue who were treated with alteplase achieved better functional outcomes than did patients given placebo. The rate of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage was higher with alteplase, but this increase did not negate the overall net benefit of thrombolysis. FUNDING: None.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the sex differences in outcomes and management after stroke using a large sample with high-quality international trial data. METHODS: Individual participant data were obtained from 5 acute stroke randomized controlled trials. Data were obtained on demographics, medication use, in-hospital treatment, and functional outcome. Study-specific crude and adjusted models were used to estimate sex differences in outcomes and management, and then pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: There were 19,652 participants, of whom 7,721 (40%) were women. After multivariable adjustments, women with ischemic stroke had higher survival at 3-6 months (odds ratio [OR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.97), higher likelihood of disability (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.36), and worse quality of life (weighted mean difference -0.07, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04). For management, women were more likely to be admitted to an acute stroke unit (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.34), but less likely to be intubated (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.93), treated for fever (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.95), or admitted to an intensive care unit (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.93). For preadmission medications, women had higher odds of being prescribed antihypertensive agents (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13-1.31) and lower odds of being prescribed antiplatelets (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.93), glucose-lowering agents (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.94), or lipid-lowering agents (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that women who had ischemic stroke had better survival but were also more disabled and had poorer quality of life. Variations in hospital and out-of-hospital management may partly explain the disparities.

AB  - Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for vitamin D have a key role in the prevention of vitamin D deficiency. However, despite adopting similar risk assessment protocols, estimates from authoritative agencies over the last 6 years have been diverse. This may have arisen from diverse approaches to data analysis. Modelling strategies for pooling of individual subject data from cognate vitamin D randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely to provide the most appropriate DRV estimates. Thus, the objective of the present work was to undertake the first-ever individual participant data (IPD)-level meta-regression, which is increasingly recognized as best practice, from seven winter-based RCTs (with 882 participants ranging in age from 4 to 90 years) of the vitamin D intake-serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) dose-response. Our IPD-derived estimates of vitamin D intakes required to maintain 97.5% of 25(OH)D concentrations >25, 30, and 50 nmol/L across the population are 10, 13, and 26 microg/day, respectively. In contrast, standard meta-regression analyses with aggregate data (as used by several agencies in recent years) from the same RCTs estimated that a vitamin D intake requirement of 14 microg/day would maintain 97.5% of 25(OH)D >50 nmol/L. These first IPD-derived estimates offer improved dietary recommendations for vitamin D because the underpinning modeling captures the between-person variability in response of serum 25(OH)D to vitamin D intake.

AB  - AIM: To confirm previous conclusions on Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) CNCM I-3856 for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management. METHODS: An individual patient data meta-analysis was performed on two randomized clinical trials studying the effect of S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 supplementation on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in IBS subjects. A total of 579 IBS subjects were included. Outcomes were the daily Likert scale scores of abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating [area under the curve (AUC) and weekly means], responder status, and bowel movements (stool frequency and consistency). Statistical analyses were conducted in Intent to Treat (ITT) population, IBS-C subjects and IBS-C subjects with an abdominal pain/discomfort score higher than or equal to 2 at baseline ("IBS-C >/= 2 subpopulation"). RESULTS: S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 significantly improved abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating during the second month of supplementation [AUC (W5-W8)] with improvement up to the minimal clinically relevant threshold of 10%: a 12.3% reduction of abdominal pain/discomfort in the ITT population compared to the Placebo group (P = 0.0134) has been observed. In the IBS-C >/= 2 subpopulation, there were a 13.1% reduction of abdominal pain/discomfort and a 14.9% reduction of bloating compared to the Placebo group (P = 0.0194 and P = 0.0145, respectively). GI symptoms significantly decreased during supplementation but no statistical differences were reported between groups at the end of the supplementation period. Responder status was defined as a subject who experienced a decrease of 1 arbitrary unit (a.u.) or 50% of the abdominal discomfort score from baseline for at least 2 wk out of the last 4 wk of the study. A significant difference between groups was reported in the ITT population, when considering the first definition: subjects in the Active group had 1.510 higher odds to be a responder (reduction of 1 a.u. of abdominal pain/discomfort) compared with subjects in the Placebo group (P = 0.0240). At the end of supplementation period, stool consistency in the Active group of the ITT population was significantly improved and classified as "normal" compared to Placebo (respectively 3.13 +/- 1.197 a.u. vs 2.58 +/- 1.020 a.u., P = 0.0003). Similar results were seen in the IBS-C >/= 2 subpopulation (Active group: 3.14 +/- 1.219 a.u. vs Placebo group: 2.59 +/- 1.017 a.u., P = 0.0009). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis supports previous data linking S. cerevisiae I-3856 and improvement of GI symptoms, in IBS overall population and in the IBS-C and IBS-C >/= 2 subpopulations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis guidelines recommend long-term macrolide treatment for patients with three or more exacerbations per year without Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Randomised controlled trials suggest that long-term macrolide treatment can prevent exacerbations in adult patients with bronchiectasis, but these individual studies have been too small to do meaningful subgroup analyses. We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to explore macrolide benefit in subpopulations, including those in which macrolide therapy is not currently recommended. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from Jan 1, 2000, to Sept 30, 2018, to identify double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics in adult patients with bronchiectasis. We applied no language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials were eligible if treatment was defined a priori as long term and had a primary or secondary outcome of bronchiectasis exacerbations. Studies in patients with cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were excluded. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was frequency of exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics. Secondary endpoints were time to first exacerbation, change in quality of life according to the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and change in FEV1. IPD meta-analysis was done using fixed effects models adjusting for age, sex, FEV1, and trial. We did prespecified subgroup analyses for each of the primary and secondary endpoints using one-step meta-analysis only. Subgroups were defined by age, sex, previous exacerbation frequency, smoking status, inhaled corticosteroid use at baseline, body-mass index at baseline, cause, C-reactive protein at baseline, baseline FEV1 percentage of predicted, SGRQ total score, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum culture at baseline. The meta-analysis is registered with the PROSPERO international register of systematic reviews, number CRD42018102908. FINDINGS: Of 234 identified studies, we included three randomised controlled trials, and IPD was obtained for 341 participants. Macrolide antibiotics reduced the frequency of exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.66; p<0.0001). We also found that macrolide treatment improved the time to first exacerbation (adjusted hazard ratio 0.46, 0.34 to 0.61; p<0.0001) and was associated with improved quality of life measured by the SGRQ (mean improvement 2.93 points, 0.03 to 5.83; p=0.048). Macrolides were not associated with a significant improvement in FEV1 (67 mL at 1 year, -22 to 112; p=0.14). Effect estimates in prespecified subgroup analyses revealed a reduced frequency of exacerbations in all prespecified subgroups, including a high level of benefit in patients with P aeruginosa infection (IRR 0.36, 0.18-0.72; p=0.0044) and in patients with one to two exacerbations per year (0.37, 0.16-0.88; p=0.025). Studies were rated as low risk of bias across all domains. INTERPRETATION: Long-term macrolide treatment significantly reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis, with similar benefits observed in all subgroups based on patient characteristics. This finding suggests that macrolides might be considered in patients in whom macrolides are not indicated according to the current guidelines, particularly if alternative approaches to reduce exacerbations have been unsuccessful. However, downsides of long-term macrolide treatment must also be taken into account. FUNDING: European Respiratory Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In diabetic patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD), the survival difference between coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) favors CABG. However, there are few data on the mortality difference between the 2 strategies in nondiabetic patients. OBJECTIVES: This study performed a patient-level meta-analysis to compare the effect of CABG versus PCI with drug-eluting stents on long-term mortality in 1,275 nondiabetic patients with multivessel CAD. METHODS: Individual patient data from the SYNTAX (Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) and the BEST (Randomized Comparison of Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery and Everolimus-Eluting Stent Implantation in the Treatment of Patients with Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease) trials were pooled. The primary outcome was death from any cause. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 61 months (interquartile range: 50 months to 62 months). The risk of death from any cause was significantly lower in the CABG group than in the PCI group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43 to 0.98; p = 0.039). A similar finding was observed for the risk of death from cardiac causes. The superiority of CABG over PCI was consistent across the major clinical subgroups. Likewise, the rate of myocardial infarction was remarkably lower after CABG than after PCI (HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.65; p < 0.001). However, the rate of stroke was not different between the 2 groups (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.59 to 2.17; p = 0.714). The need for repeat revascularization was significantly lower in the CABG group than in the PCI group (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.75; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CABG, as compared with PCI with drug-eluting stents, significantly reduced the long-term risk of mortality in nondiabetic patients with multivessel CAD.

AB  - PURPOSE: Restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategies remain controversial in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the prognostic benefits of restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: We identified randomized clinical trials through the 9th of December 2017 that investigated a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy versus a liberal transfusion strategy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Individual patient data from each study were collected. Meta-analyses were performed for the primary and secondary outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. A trial sequential analysis (TSA)-adjusted random-effects model was used to pool the results from the included studies for the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Seven trials involving a total of 8886 patients were included. The TSA evaluations suggested that this meta-analysis could draw firm negative results, and the data were sufficient. There was no evidence that the risk of 30-day mortality differed between the patients assigned to a restrictive blood cell transfusion strategy and a liberal transfusion strategy (odds ratio (OR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.24; p = 0.87). Furthermore, the study suggested that the restrictive transfusion strategy was not associated with significant increases in pulmonary morbidity (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.34; p = 0.44), postoperative infection (OR 1.11; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.3; p = 0.58), acute kidney injury (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.14; p = 0.71), acute myocardial infarction (OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.27; p = 0.78), or cerebrovascular accidents (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.30; p = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that the restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy was not inferior to the liberal strategy with respect to 30-day mortality, pulmonary morbidity, postoperative infection, cerebrovascular accidents, acute kidney injury, or acute myocardial infarction, and fewer red blood cells were transfused.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Small trials suggest that levosimendan is associated with a favorable outcome in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, recently published larger-scale trials did not provide evidence for a similar benefit from levosimendan. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the survival benefits of levosimendan in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and to investigate its effects in subgroups of patients with preoperative low-ejection fraction (EF). METHODS: We identified randomized clinical trials through 20 April 2017 that investigated levosimendan therapy versus control in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Individual patient data from each study were compiled. Meta-analyses were performed for primary outcomes, secondary outcomes and serious adverse events, and subgroup analyses according to the preoperative EF of enrolled patients were also conducted. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: Seventeen studies involving a total of 2756 patients were included. Levosimendan therapy was associated with a significant reduction in 30-day mortality (RR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.93; p = 0.02) and reduced the risk of death in single-center trials (RR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.79; p = 0.004) and in subgroup trials of inferior quality (RR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.92; p = 0.02); however, in multicenter and in high-quality subgroup-analysis trials, no significant difference in mortality was observed between patients who received levosimendan therapy and controls (p > 0.05). However, in high-quality subgroup trials, levosimendan therapy was associated with reduced mortality in patients in a preoperative low-EF subgroup (RR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.88; p = 0.01). Similarly, only patients in the preoperative low-EF subgroup benefited in terms of reduced risk of renal replacement therapy (RR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.85; p = 0.007). Furthermore, levosimendan therapy was associated with a significant reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (MDR -17.19; 95% CI, -34.43 to -2.94; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the benefit of levosimendan in terms of survival was not shown in multicenter or in high-quality trials; however, levosimendan therapy was associated with reduced mortality in patients with preoperative ventricular systolic dysfunction.

AB  - Various trials and meta-analyses have reported conflicting results concerning the application of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) for sepsis and septic shock. The aim of this study was to update the evidence by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Multiple databases were searched from initial through August, 2016 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the associations between the use of EGDT and mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects model and heterogeneity was examined through subgroup analyses. The primary outcome of interest was patient all-cause mortality including hospital or ICU mortality. Seventeen RCTs including 6207 participants with 3234 in the EGDT group and 2973 in the control group were eligible for this study. Meta-analysis showed that EGDT did not significantly reduce hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02) compared with control group for patients with sepsis or septic shock. The findings of subgroup analyses stratified by study region, number of research center, year of enrollment, clinical setting, sample size, timing of EGDT almost remained constant with that of the primary analysis. Our findings provide evidence that EGDT offers neutral survival effects for patients with sepsis or septic shock. Further meta-analyses based on larger well-designed RCTs or individual patient data meta-analysis are required to explore the survival benefits of EDGT in patients with sepsis or septic shock.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, no specific drug-eluting stent (DES) has fully proven its superiority over others in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of coronary artery stents in STEMI patients in a patient-level network meta-analysis. METHODS: Eligible studies were dedicated randomized controlled trials comparing different stents in STEMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with at least 12 months of clinical follow-up. Of 19 studies identified from the published data, individual patient data were collected in 15 studies with 10,979 patients representing 87.7% of patients in the overall network of evidence. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiac death, reinfarction, or target lesion revascularization. RESULTS: Overall, 8,487 (77.3%) of 10,979 STEMI patients were male and the mean age was 60.7 years. At a median follow-up of 3 years, compared with bare-metal stents (BMS), patients treated with paclitaxel-, sirolimus-, everolimus-, or biolimus-eluting stents had a significantly lower risk of the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs]: 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63 to 0.88], 0.65 [95% CI: 0.49 to 0.85], 0.70 [95% CI: 0.53 to 0.91], and 0.66 [95% CI: 0.49 to 0.88], respectively). The risk of primary endpoint was not different between patients treated with BMS and zotarolimus-eluting stents (adjusted HR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.51 to 1.38]). Among patients treated with DES, no significant difference in the risk of the primary outcome was demonstrated. Treatment with second-generation DES was associated with significantly lower risk of definite or probable stent thrombosis compared with BMS (adjusted HR: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.42 to 0.89]) and first-generation DES (adjusted HR: 0.56 [95% CI: 0.36 to 0.88]). CONCLUSIONS: In STEMI patients, DES were superior to BMS with respect to long-term efficacy. No difference in long-term efficacy and safety was observed among specific DES. Second-generation were superior to first-generation DES in reducing stent thrombosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Text message interventions have been shown to be effective in prevention and management of several non-communicable disease risk factors. However, the extent to which their effects might vary in different participants and settings is uncertain. We aim to conduct a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials examining text message interventions aimed to prevent cardiovascular diseases (CVD) through modification of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Systematic review and IPD meta-analysis will be conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis of IPD (PRISMA-IPD) guidelines. Electronic database of published studies (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library) and international trial registries will be searched to identify relevant randomised clinical trials. Authors of studies meeting the inclusion criteria will be invited to join the IPD meta-analysis group and contribute study data to the common database. The primary outcome will be the difference between intervention and control groups in blood pressure at 6-month follow-up. Key secondary outcomes include effects on lipid parameters, body mass index, smoking levels and self-reported quality of life. If sufficient data is available, we will also analyse blood pressure and other secondary outcomes at 12 months. IPD meta-analysis will be performed using a one-step approach and modelling data simultaneously while accounting for the clustering of the participants within studies. This study will use the existing data to assess the effectiveness of text message-based interventions on CVRFs, the consistency of any effects by participant subgroups and across different healthcare settings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained for the individual studies by the trial investigators from relevant local ethics committees. This study will include anonymised data for secondary analysis and investigators will be asked to check that this is consistent with their existing approvals. Results will be disseminated via scientific forums including peer-reviewed publications and presentations at international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42016033236.

AB  - Aims: Recent guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40-49% should be managed similar to LVEF >/= 50%. We investigated the effect of beta-blockers according to LVEF in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Methods and results: Individual patient data meta-analysis of 11 trials, stratified by baseline LVEF and heart rhythm (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT0083244; PROSPERO: CRD42014010012). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death over 1.3 years median follow-up, with an intention-to-treat analysis. For 14 262 patients in sinus rhythm, median LVEF was 27% (interquartile range 21-33%), including 575 patients with LVEF 40-49% and 244 >/= 50%. Beta-blockers reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared to placebo in sinus rhythm, an effect that was consistent across LVEF strata, except for those in the small subgroup with LVEF >/= 50%. For LVEF 40-49%, death occurred in 21/292 [7.2%] randomized to beta-blockers compared to 35/283 [12.4%] with placebo; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-1.03]. Cardiovascular death occurred in 13/292 [4.5%] with beta-blockers and 26/283 [9.2%] with placebo; adjusted HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.24-0.97). Over a median of 1.0 years following randomization (n = 4601), LVEF increased with beta-blockers in all groups in sinus rhythm except LVEF >/=50%. For patients in atrial fibrillation at baseline (n = 3050), beta-blockers increased LVEF when < 50% at baseline, but did not improve prognosis. Conclusion: Beta-blockers improve LVEF and prognosis for patients with heart failure in sinus rhythm with a reduced LVEF. The data are most robust for LVEF < 40%, but similar benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with LVEF 40-49%.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth complicates almost all triplet pregnancies and no preventive strategy has proven effective. OBJECTIVE: To determine, using individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis, whether the outcome of triplet pregnancy is affected by prophylactic administration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17OHPc). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched literature databases, trial registries and references in published articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of progestogens versus control that included women with triplet pregnancies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Investigators from identified RCTs collaborated on the protocol and contributed their IPD. The primary outcome was a composite measure of adverse perinatal outcome. The secondary outcome was the rate of birth before 32 weeks of gestation. Other pre-specified outcomes included randomisation-to-delivery interval and rates of birth at <24, <28 and <34 weeks of gestation. MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs of 17OHPc versus placebo included 232 mothers with triplet pregnancies and their 696 offspring. Risk-of-bias scores and between-study heterogeneity were low. Baseline characteristics were comparable between 17OHPc and placebo groups. The rate of the composite adverse perinatal outcome was similar among those treated with 17OHPc and those treated with placebo (34 and 35%, respectively; risk ratio [RR] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.79-1.2). The rate of birth at <32 weeks was also similar in the two groups (35 and 38%, respectively; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55-1.56). There were no significant between-group differences in perinatal mortality rate, randomisation-to-delivery interval, or other specified outcomes. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic 17OHPc given to mothers with triplet pregnancies had no significant impact on perinatal outcome or pregnancy duration. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: 17-Hydroxyprogesterone caproate had no significant impact on the outcome or duration of triplet pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although assessment of cardiovascular safety is mandated by regulatory agencies for the development of new drugs to treat type 2 diabetes, evaluation of their renal safety has been relatively neglected. STUDY DESIGN: Individual patient-level data pooled analysis of 13 phase 2 or 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor linagliptin. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Participants who participated in any of 13 randomized clinical trials and fulfilled predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, such as being drug-naive (hemoglobin A1c, 7.0%-11.0% [53-97 mmol/mol]) or being on background glucose-lowering therapy (hemoglobin A1c, 6.5%-10.5% [48-91 mmol/mol]). INTERVENTION: Of 5,466 consenting individuals with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, 3,505 received linagliptin, 5mg/d, and 1,961 received placebo. OUTCOMES: The primary kidney disease outcome was defined as first occurrence during the study of 6 predefined safety end points: new onset of moderate elevation of albuminuria (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio [ACR] >30 mg/g with baseline values </= 30 mg/g), new onset of severe elevation of albuminuria (ACR > 300 mg/g with baseline values </= 300 mg/g), reduction in kidney function (serum creatinine increase to >/=250 mumol/L from a baseline value <250 mumol/L), halving of estimated glomerular filtration rate (loss of baseline eGFR >50%), acute renal failure (ascertained from diagnostic codes), or death from any cause. MEASUREMENTS: Albuminuria was assessed using ACR. GFR was estimated using the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation. RESULTS: Cumulative exposure (person-years) was 1,751 for linagliptin and 1,055 for placebo. The primary composite outcome occurred in 448 (12.8%) and 306 (15.6%) participants in the linagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Linagliptin treatment significantly reduced the hazard of kidney disease events by 16% compared with placebo (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.97; P=0.02). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective and hypothesis-generating study involving short- to midterm clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Linagliptin was not associated with increased kidney disease risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. The potential of this drug to improve kidney disease outcomes warrants further investigation.

AB  - Objective: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world evidence for the use of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and clinicaltrials.gov for all relevant articles. Relevant patient and stimulation predictors as well as seizure outcomes were assessed. For studies with and without individual participant data (IPD), the primary outcomes were the rate of "favorable response" (reduction in seizure frequency >/=50%) and pooled event rate of mean reduction in seizure frequency, respectively. Outcomes were assessed with comparative statistics and random-effects meta-analysis models. Results: Of 3,477 identified articles, 12 met eligibility and were included in this review. We were able to obtain IPD for 5 articles constituting 34 participants. Univariate analysis on IPD identified greater favorable response event rates between participants with temporal seizure focus versus extratemporal (50% vs. 14%, p = 0.045) and between participants who were stimulated with a figure-8 coil versus other types (47% vs. 0%, p = 0.01). We also performed study-level meta-analysis on the remaining 7 studies without IPD, which included 212 participants. The pooled mean event rate of 50% seizure reduction using low-frequency rTMS was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12-57%). Sensitivity analysis revealed that studies with a mean age </=21 years and studies using targeted stimulation had the highest seizure reduction rates compared to studies with a mean age >21 years (69% vs. 18%) and not using a targeted stimulation (47% vs. 14-20%). Moreover, we identified high interstudy heterogeneity, moderate study bias, and high publication bias. Significance: Real-world evidence suggests that low-frequency rTMS using a figure-8 coil may be an effective therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in pediatric patients. This meta-analysis can inform the design and expedite recruitment of a subsequent randomized clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants born preterm compared with infants born at term are at an increased risk of dying and of serious morbidities in early life, and those who survive have higher rates of neurological impairments. It remains unclear whether exposure to repeat courses of prenatal corticosteroids can reduce these risks. This individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis (MA) assessed whether repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment given to women at ongoing risk of preterm birth in order to benefit their infants is modified by participant or treatment factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Trials were eligible for inclusion if they randomised women considered at risk of preterm birth who had already received an initial, single course of prenatal corticosteroid seven or more days previously and in which corticosteroids were compared with either placebo or no placebo. The primary outcomes for the infants were serious outcome, use of respiratory support, and birth weight z-scores; for the children, they were death or any neurosensory disability; and for the women, maternal sepsis. Studies were identified using the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth search strategy. Date of last search was 20 January 2015. IPD were sought from investigators with eligible trials. Risk of bias was assessed using criteria from the Cochrane Collaboration. IPD were analysed using a one-stage approach. Eleven trials, conducted between 2002 and 2010, were identified as eligible, with five trials being from the United States, two from Canada, and one each from Australia and New Zealand, Finland, India, and the United Kingdom. All 11 trials were included, with 4,857 women and 5,915 infants contributing data. The mean gestational age at trial entry for the trials was between 27.4 weeks and 30.2 weeks. There was no significant difference in the proportion of infants with a serious outcome (relative risk [RR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.04, 5,893 infants, 11 trials, p = 0.33 for heterogeneity). There was a reduction in the use of respiratory support in infants exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids compared with infants not exposed (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97, 5,791 infants, 10 trials, p = 0.64 for heterogeneity). The number needed to treat (NNT) to benefit was 21 (95% CI 14 to 41) women/fetus to prevent one infant from needing respiratory support. Birth weight z-scores were lower in the repeat corticosteroid group (mean difference -0.12, 95%CI -0.18 to -0.06, 5,902 infants, 11 trials, p = 0.80 for heterogeneity). No statistically significant differences were seen for any of the primary outcomes for the child (death or any neurosensory disability) or for the woman (maternal sepsis). The treatment effect varied little by reason the woman was considered to be at risk of preterm birth, the number of fetuses in utero, the gestational age when first trial treatment course was given, or the time prior to birth that the last dose was given. Infants exposed to between 2-5 courses of repeat corticosteroids showed a reduction in both serious outcome and the use of respiratory support compared with infants exposed to only a single repeat course. However, increasing numbers of repeat courses of corticosteroids were associated with larger reductions in birth z-scores for weight, length, and head circumference. Not all trials could provide data for all of the prespecified subgroups, so this limited the power to detect differences because event rates are low for some important maternal, infant, and childhood outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that repeat prenatal corticosteroids given to women at ongoing risk of preterm birth after an initial course reduced the likelihood of their infant needing respiratory support after birth and led to neonatal benefits. Body size measures at birth were lower in infants exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids. Our findings suggest that to provide clinical benefit with the least effect on growth, the number of repeat treatment courses should be limited to a maximum of three and the total dose to between 24 mg and 48 mg.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Melancholic and atypical depression are widely thought to moderate or predict outcome of pharmacological and psychological treatments of adult depression, but that has not yet been established. This study uses the data from four earlier trials comparing cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) versus antidepressant medications (ADMs; and pill placebo when available) to examine the extent to which melancholic and atypical depression moderate or predict outcome in an "individual patient data" meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for studies directly comparing CBT versus ADM, contacted the researchers, integrated the resulting datasets from these studies into one big dataset, and selected the studies that included melancholic or atypical depressive subtyping according to DSM-IV criteria at baseline (n = 4, with 805 patients). After multiple imputation of missing data at posttest, mixed models were used to conduct the main analyses. RESULTS: In none of the analyses was melancholic or atypical depression found to significantly moderate outcome (indicating a better or worse outcome of these patients in CBT compared to ADM; i.e., an interaction), predict outcome independent of treatment group (i.e., a main effect), or predict outcome within a given modality. The outcome differences between patients with melancholia or atypical depression versus those without were consistently very small (all effect sizes g < 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: We found no indication that melancholic or atypical depressions are significant or relevant moderators or predictors of outcome of CBT and ADM.

AB  - Background: To identify baseline/clinical characteristics associated with clinically meaningful responses to insulin glargine 100 U/mL (IGlar) in insulin-naive people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: Individual participant data were pooled from 3 randomized trials to compare baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes associated with 24-week response to IGlar in combination with non-insulin antihyperglycemic agents in participants with T2DM. Responders were defined as achieving endpoint HbA1c target < 53 mmol/mol (< 7%) and/or >/= 11 mmol/mol (>/= 1%) HbA1c reduction from baseline. Results: Differences in baseline characteristics for responders versus nonresponders were higher HbA1c (99 vs 91 mmol/mol [9.1 vs 8.3%]; P < 0.001), higher fasting blood glucose (FBG; 10.4 vs 8.8 mmol/L [187 vs 159 mg/dL; P < 0.001), and fewer participants (94% vs 98%; P = 0.006) taking oral medications targeting postprandial blood glucose (BG). Most participants (80%) achieved one or both components of composite endpoint. 12-week response was a strong predictor of subsequent 24-week response (sensitivity, 85.9%; predictive positive value, 91.4%). At both 12 and 24 weeks, < 40% of responders and nonresponders reached target FBG </= 5.6 mmol/L (</= 100 mg/dL). Responders at 24 weeks had higher incidence of hypoglycemia (total, 82.5% vs 70.4%; P < 0.001; nocturnal, 60.3% vs 50.5%; P = 0.002; documented symptomatic, 65.8% vs 55.6%; P < 0.001) than nonresponders. Conclusions: Baseline characteristics associated with response were identified. The strong predictability of 12-week response suggests that the magnitude of early HbA1c reduction should be considered when assessing response to IGlar. More aggressive IGlar titration may be reasonable for nonresponders and responders who have not reached FBG and HbA1c targets, taking into account other BG timepoints.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of chemotherapy added to a surgical locoregional treatment (LRT) for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the sub-group of trials with surgical LRT included in the meta-analysis on chemotherapy in head and neck cancer (MACH-NC). Data from published and unpublished randomized trials comparing the addition of chemotherapy to LRT in HNSCC patients were sought using electronic database searching for the period 1965-2000, hand searching and by contacting experts in the field. Trials with less than 60 patients, or preoperative radiotherapy or where the type of LRT could not be individually determined were excluded. All individual patient data were checked for internal consistency, compared with published reports, and validated with trialists. Data were pooled using a fixed-effect model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane test and I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Twenty-four trials were eligible (5000 patients). Chemotherapy improved overall survival (HR=0.92 [95%CI: 0.85-0.99] p=0.02). There was a significant interaction between treatment effect and timing of chemotherapy (p=0.08 at pre-specified threshold of 0.10) with a greater effect for concomitant chemotherapy (HR=0.79, 95%CI: 0.69-0.92). The benefit of chemotherapy was greater in women (HRwomen=0.63, 95%CI: 0.50-0.80) compared to men (HRmen=0.96, 95%CI: 0.89-1.04; p for interaction=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis confirmed the benefit of concomitant chemotherapy added to surgical LRT. The role of induction therapy as yet to be determined as it did not improve OS. Women may benefit more than men from chemotherapy.

AB  - Concerns have emerged regarding a higher risk of stent thrombosis after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, especially in the setting of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis based on individual patient data to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) as compared to bare metal stents (BMS) in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI. We examined all completed randomized trials on PES for STEMI. Individual patient data were obtained from six trials. We performed survival analyses with the use of Cox-regression analysis stratified according to trial. Kaplan-Meier survival curves are presented with event rates reported as estimated probabilities. A subsequent landmark analysis was performed for patients who were event-free at 1-year follow-up in order to define outcome in terms of early (</=1 year) and late (>1 year) events. A total of six trials were finally included in the meta-analysis with 4435 patients, 2875 (64.8 %) assigned to PES and 1560 (35.2 %) to BMS. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between the two groups. However, a significantly higher percentage of patients in the DES group were on dual antiplatelet therapy during 3-year follow-up, as compared to BMS. At long-term follow-up (1,095 [1,090-1,155] days), no significant difference between PES and BMS was observed in mortality (9.2 vs 11.9 %, respectively, HR [95 % CI] = 0.84 [0.67, 1.06], p = 0.15, pheterogeneity = 0.59), reinfarction (8.8 vs 7 %, respectively; HR [95 % CI] = 1.10 [0.84, 1.44], p = 0.51, pheterogeneity = 0.32), stent thrombosis (6.7 vs 4.0 % respectively, HR [95 % CI] = 1.13 [0.82, 1.55], p = 0.45, pheterogeneity = 0.99) and TVR (11.9 vs 20.0 %; HR [95 % CI] = 0.64 [0.54, 0.77], p < 0.0001, pheterogeneity = 0.25). Landmark analysis showed that PES was associated with a significantly higher rate of very late reinfarction (>1 year) (5.6 vs 3.9 %, HR [95 % CI] = 1.61 [1.05-2.47], p = 0.03, pheterogeneity = 0.51], very late ST (2.9 vs 1.1 %, HR [95 % CI] = 1.88 [1.00-3.54], p = 0.05, pheterogeneity = 0.94]. The present pooled patient-level meta-analysis demonstrates that among STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI, PES compared to BMS is associated with a significant reduction in TVR at long-term follow-up. Although there were no differences in cumulative mortality, reinfarction or stent thrombosis, the incidence of very late reinfarction and stent thrombosis was increased with PES.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several concerns have emerged about the higher risk of very late stent thrombosis (ST) with first generation drug-eluting stent (DES) especially among STEMI patients. Newer generation DES has demonstrated to reduce ST at mid-term follow-up. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to perform an individual patient's data meta-analysis of trials comparing 1st generation DES vs. 2nd generation DES (everolimus-eluting stent, EES) in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI. METHODS: We performed a formal search of electronic databases (MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and scientific session presentations from January 2010 to June 2016. We included all completed randomized trials comparing 1st vs. EES for patient presenting with STEMI. RESULTS: Individual patients data were obtained from 3 trials, including a total of 1581 patients (686 or 43.4% randomized to 1st generation DES and 895 or 56.4% randomized to EES). At long-term follow-up (1584+/-588days), EES did not significantly reduce mortality (7.8.% vs 11.7%, HR [95%CI]=0.77 [0.52, 1.13], p=0.18, pheterogeneity=0.93), cardiac mortality (6.2% vs 7.6%, HR [95%CI]=0.90 [0.56, 1.44], p=0.65, pheterogeneity=0.85), and reinfarction (8.1% versus 11.2%, respectively; HR [95%CI]=0.74 [0.51, 1.07], p=0.11, pheterogeneity=0.52). However, EES significantly reduced the occurrence of ST (3.4% versus 6.1% respectively, HR [95%CI]=0.56 [0.32, 0.97], p=0.04, pheterogeneity=0.42) and target vessel revascularization (TVR) (14.2% versus 20.1%; HR [95%CI]=0.63 [0.42, 0.96], p=0.03, pheterogeneity=0.55). Landmark analysis showed more consistent benefits in ST with EES within 1year, whereas benefits in TVR were mostly observed later than 1year. CONCLUSIONS: The present pooled patient-level meta-analysis demonstrates that among STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI, EES as compared to 1st generation DES is associated with a significant reduction in ST and TVR at long-term follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy (CT) combined with radiotherapy is the standard treatment of 'limited-stage' small-cell lung cancer. However, controversy persists over the optimal timing of thoracic radiotherapy and CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a meta-analysis of individual patient data in randomized trials comparing earlier versus later radiotherapy, or shorter versus longer radiotherapy duration, as defined in each trial. We combined the results from trials using the stratified log-rank test to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs). The primary outcome was overall survival. RESULTS: Twelve trials with 2668 patients were eligible. Data from nine trials comprising 2305 patients were available for analysis. The median follow-up was 10 years. When all trials were analysed together, 'earlier or shorter' versus 'later or longer' thoracic radiotherapy did not affect overall survival. However, the HR for overall survival was significantly in favour of 'earlier or shorter' radiotherapy among trials with a similar proportion of patients who were compliant with CT (defined as having received 100% or more of the planned CT cycles) in both arms (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.91), and in favour of 'later or longer' radiotherapy among trials with different rates of CT compliance (HR 1.19, 1.05-1.34, interaction test, P < 0.0001). The absolute gain between 'earlier or shorter' versus 'later or longer' thoracic radiotherapy in 5-year overall survival for similar and for different CT compliance trials was 7.7% (95% CI 2.6-12.8%) and -2.2% (-5.8% to 1.4%), respectively. However, 'earlier or shorter' thoracic radiotherapy was associated with a higher incidence of severe acute oesophagitis than 'later or longer' radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: 'Earlier or shorter' delivery of thoracic radiotherapy with planned CT significantly improves 5-year overall survival at the expense of more acute toxicity, especially oesophagitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that antidepressant benefits are smaller for mild than severe depression. Because antidepressants are also used for anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we examined the influence of severity for these disorders. METHODS: We used individual patient data of eight trials (3,430 participants) for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); four trials (1,195 participants) for social anxiety disorder (SAD); four trials (1,132 participants) for OCD; three trials (1,071 participants) for PTSD; and 10 trials (2,151 participants) for panic disorder (PD). Mixed-effects models were used to investigate an interaction between severity and treatment group. RESULTS: For GAD and PD, severity moderated antidepressant efficacy. The antidepressant-placebo difference was 1.4 (95% CI: 0.4-2.5; SMD: 0.21) Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) points for participants with mild GAD (baseline HAM-A = 10), increasing to 4.0 (3.4-4.6; SMD: 0.45) or greater for severely ill participants (HAM-A >/= 30). For PD, the difference was 0.4 (0.3-0.6) panic attacks/2 weeks for participants with 10 panic attacks/2 weeks at baseline, increasing to 4.7 (3.0-6.4) for participants with 40. For SAD, OCD, and PTSD, no interaction was found. Across severity levels, the differences were 16.1 (12.9-19.3; SMD: 0.59) Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale points, 3.4 (2.5-4.4, SMD: 0.39) Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale points, and 10.3 (6.9-13.6; SMD: 0.41) Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale points. CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressants are equally effective across severity levels for SAD, OCD, and PTSD. For GAD and PD, however, benefits are small at low severity, and the benefit-risk ratio may be unfavorable for these patients.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify predictors of outcome of conservative and minimally invasive surgical management of pain originating from the sacroiliac joint (SIJ). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Three recently published prospective trials have shown that minimally invasive SIJ fusion (SIJF) using triangular titanium implants produces better outcomes than conservative management for patients with pain originating from the SIJ. Due to limitations in individual trial sample size, analyses of predictors of treatment outcome were not conducted. METHODS: We pooled individual patient data from the three trials and used random effects models with multivariate regression analysis to identify predictors for treatment outcome separately for conservative and minimally invasive surgical treatment. Outcome was measured using visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and EuroQOL-5D (EQ-5D). RESULTS: We included 423 patients assigned to either nonsurgical management (NSM, n = 97) or SIJF (n = 326) between 2013 and 2015. The reduction in SIJ pain was 37.9 points larger [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 32.5-43.4, P < 0.0001] in the SIJF group than in the NSM group. Similarly, the improvement in ODI was 18.3 points larger (95% CI 14.3-22.4), P < 0.0001). In NSM, we found no predictors of outcome. In SIJF, a reduced improvement in outcome was predicted by smoking (P = 0.030), opioid use (P = 0.017), lower patient age (P = 0.008), and lower duration of SIJ pain (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the view that SIJF leads to better treatment outcome than conservative management of SIJ pain and that a higher margin of improvement can be predicted in nonsmokers, nonopioid users, and patients of increased age and with longer pain duration. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Imbalance of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and related modulators has been implicated as an important factor in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND). In this context, the role and mechanism of action of gabapentin and baclofen have been extensively investigated, although with conflicting results. This is the first systematic review to assess clinical trials of GABA modulators for the treatment of ALS. OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of gabapentin, baclofen, or other GABA modulators in delaying the progression of ALS, and to evaluate adverse effects of these interventions SEARCH METHODS: On 16 August 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and LILACS. In addition, we checked the bibliographies of the trials found in order to identify any other trials, and contacted trial authors to identify relevant unpublished results or additional clinical trials. On 30 August 2016, we searched two clinical trials registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTsTypes of participants: adults with a diagnosis of probable or definite ALSTypes of interventions: gabapentin, baclofen, or other GABA modulators compared with placebo, no treatment, or each otherPrimary outcome: survival at one year from study enrollmentSecondary outcomes: individual rate of decline of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), expressed as arm megascore; rate of decline of per cent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC); rate of decline of ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS); health-related quality of life; survival evaluated by pooling hazards; and adverse events DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently checked titles and abstracts identified by the searches. The review authors obtained and independently analyzed original individual participant data from each included study; additional review authors and the Cochrane Neuromuscular Managing Editor checked the outcome data. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in included studies. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently checked titles and abstracts identified by the searches. The review authors obtained and independently analyzed original individual participant data from each included study; additional review authors and the Cochrane Neuromuscular Managing Editor checked the outcome data. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We identified two double-blind RCTs of gabapentin treatment in ALS for inclusion in this review. We found no eligible RCTs of baclofen or other GABA modulators. The selected studies were phase II and phase III trials, which lasted six and nine months, respectively. They were highly comparable because both were comparisons of oral gabapentin and placebo, performed by the same investigators. The trials enrolled 355 participants with ALS: 80 in the gabapentin group and 72 in the placebo group in the first (phase II) trial and 101 in the gabapentin group and 102 in the placebo group in the second (phase III) trial. Neither trial was long enough to report survival at one year, which was our primary outcome. We found little or no difference in estimated one-year survival between the treated group and the placebo group (78% versus 77%, P = 0.63 by log-rank test; high-quality evidence). We also found little or no difference in the rate of decline of MVIC expressed as arm megascore, or rate of FVC decline (high-quality evidence). One trial investigated monthly decline in the ALSFRS and quality of life measured using the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) and found little or no difference between groups (moderate-quality evidence). The trials reported similar adverse events. Complaints that were clearly elevated in those taking gabapentin, based on analyses of the combined data, were light-headedness, drowsiness, and limb swelling (high-quality evidence). Fatigue and falls occurred more frequently with gabapentin than with placebo in one trial, but when we combined the data for fatigue from both trials, there was no clear difference between the groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias in the included trials as low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: According to high-quality evidence, gabapentin is not effective in treating ALS. It does not extend survival, slow the rate of decline of muscle strength, respiratory function and, based on moderate-quality evidence, probably does not improve quality of life or slow monthly decline in the ALSFRS. Other GABA modulators have not been studied in randomized trials.

AB  - PURPOSE: The clinical benefits provided by using anthracycline-contained regimens in patients with early breast cancer (EBC) remain uncertain. This meta-analysis used data from all relevant trials to compare treatment outcomes for patients with EBC receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with non-anthracycline-contained regimens or anthracycline-contained regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient data were collected on 7 randomized trials comparing non-anthracycline-contained regimens with anthracycline-contained regimens, a total of 14,451 women were analyzed. The hazard ratios (HR) of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), and the risk ratios for grades 3 to 4 toxicities were extracted from the retrieved studies and analyzed using various statistical methods. A pooled analysis was accomplished and HR with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) was derived. The significant differences in DFS and OS were explored. A heterogeneity test was applied as well. RESULTS: Among 7 eligible trials, significant differences in favor of anthracycline-contained regimens were seen in DFS (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78-0.95; P = .003) and in OS (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75-0.97; P = .01). Subgroup analyses of DFS showed similar treatment effects by hormone-receptor status and nodal status, but differential effects by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status, menopausal status, and malignancy grade. Sensitive analysis showed that the DFS of taxanes and cyclophosphamide (TC) was noninferior to anthracycline-contained regiments. CONCLUSION: Despite failing to show noninferior to the anthracycline-contained regimens in patients with EBC, it provides evidence that both regimens significantly improved the DFS and OS, and TC regimen may be noninferior to anthracycline-contained regimens.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize efficacy and safety data on a new progesterone compound which is available for subcutaneous administration as compared to vaginally administered progesterone for luteal phase support in patients undergoing IVF treatment. DESIGN: Data from two randomized phase III trials (07EU/Prg06 and 07USA/Prg05) performed according to GCP standards with a total sample size of 1435 per-protocol patients were meta-analyzed on an individual patient data level. SETTING: University affiliated reproductive medicine unit. PATIENTS: Subcutaneous progesterone was administered to a total of 714 subjects and vaginal progesterone was administered to a total of 721 subjects who underwent fresh embryo transfer after ovarian stimulation followed by IVF or ICSI. The subjects were between 18 and 42 years old and had a BMI <30 kg/m2. INTERVENTIONS: Subcutaneous progesterone 25 mg daily vs. either progesterone vaginal gel 90 mg daily (07EU/Prg06) or 100 mg intravaginal twice a day (07USA/Prg05) for luteal phase support in IVF patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ongoing pregnancy rate beyond 10 gestational weeks, live birth rate and OHSS risk. RESULTS: The administration of subcutaneous progesterone versus intra-vaginal progesterone had no impact on ongoing pregnancy likelihood (OR = 0.865, 95% CI 0.694 to 1.077; P = n.s.), live birth likelihood (OR = 0.889, 95% CI 0.714 to 1.106; P = n.s.) or OHSS risk (OR = 0.995, 95% CI 0.565 to 1.754; P = n.s.) in regression analyses accounting for clustering of patients within trials, while adjusting for important confounders. Only female age and number of oocytes retrieved were significant predictors of live birth likelihood and OHSS risk. CONCLUSION: No statistical significant or clinical significant differences exist between subcutaneous and vaginal progesterone for luteal phase support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite widespread use, questions remain about the efficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza. We aimed to do an individual patient data meta-analysis for all clinical trials comparing oseltamivir with placebo for treatment of seasonal influenza in adults regarding symptom alleviation, complications, and safety. METHODS: We included all published and unpublished Roche-sponsored randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of 75 mg twice a day oseltamivir in adults. Trials of oseltamivir for treatment of naturally occurring influenza-like illness in adults reporting at least one of the study outcomes were eligible. We also searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register for other relevant trials published before Jan 1, 2014 (search last updated on Nov 27, 2014). We analysed intention-to-treat infected, intention-to-treat, and safety populations. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of all symptoms analysed with accelerated failure time methods. We used risk ratios and Mantel-Haenszel methods to work out complications, admittances to hospital, and safety outcomes. FINDINGS: We included data from nine trials including 4328 patients. In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted a 21% shorter time to alleviation of all symptoms for oseltamivir versus placebo recipients (time ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.74-0.85; p<0.0001). The median times to alleviation were 97.5 h for oseltamivir and 122.7 h for placebo groups (difference -25.2 h, 95% CI -36.2 to -16.0). For the intention-to-treat population, the estimated treatment effect was attenuated (time ratio 0.85) but remained highly significant (median difference -17.8 h). In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics more than 48 h after randomisation (risk ratio [RR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.75; p=0.0001; 4.9% oseltamivir vs 8.7% placebo, risk difference -3.8%, 95% CI -5.0 to -2.2) and also fewer admittances to hospital for any cause (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17-0.81; p=0.013; 0.6% oseltamivir, 1.7% placebo, risk difference -1.1%, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.3). Regarding safety, oseltamivir increased the risk of nausea (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.29-1.99; p<0.0001; 9.9% oseltamivir vs 6.2% placebo, risk difference 3.7%, 95% CI 1.8-6.1) and vomiting (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.83-3.23; p<0.0001; 8.0% oseltamivir vs 3.3% placebo, risk difference 4.7%, 95% CI 2.7-7.3). We recorded no effect on neurological or psychiatric disorders or serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that oseltamivir in adults with influenza accelerates time to clinical symptom alleviation, reduces risk of lower respiratory tract complications, and admittance to hospital, but increases the occurrence of nausea and vomiting.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is an important cause of poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Trials of magnesium treatment starting <4 days after symptom onset found no effect on poor outcome or DCI in SAH. Earlier installment of treatment might be more effective, but individual trials had not enough power for such a subanalysis. We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis to study whether magnesium is effective when given within different time frames within 24 hours after the SAH. METHODS: Patients were divided into categories according to the delay between symptom onset and start of the study medication: <6, 6 to 12, 12 to 24, and >24 hours. We calculated adjusted risk ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for magnesium versus placebo treatment for poor outcome and DCI. RESULTS: We included 5 trials totaling 1981 patients; 83 patients started treatment<6 hours. For poor outcome, the adjusted risk ratios of magnesium treatment for start <6 hours were 1.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.83-2.51); for 6 to 12 hours 1.03 (0.65-1.63), for 12 to 24 hours 0.84 (0.65-1.09), and for >24 hours 1.06 (0.87-1.31), and for DCI, <6 hours 1.76 (0.68-4.58), for 6 to 12 hours 2.09 (0.99-4.39), for 12 to 24 hours 0.80 (0.56-1.16), and for >24 hours 1.08 (0.88-1.32). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests no beneficial effect of magnesium treatment on poor outcome or DCI when started early after SAH onset. Although the number of patients was small and a beneficial effect cannot be definitively excluded, we found no justification for a new trial with early magnesium treatment after SAH.

AB  - PURPOSE: Our objective was to perform a meta-analysis on RCTs that compared outcomes in children with perforated appendicitis (PA) who underwent either early appendectomy (EA) or interval appendectomy (IA). We also sought to determine if the presence of an intra-abdominal abscess (IAA) at admission impacted treatment strategy and outcomes. METHODS: We identified two RCTs comparing EA versus IA in children with PA. A meta-analysis was performed using regression models and the overall adverse event rate was analyzed. The treatment effect variation depending on the presence of IAA at admission was also evaluated. RESULTS: EA significantly reduced the odds of an adverse event (OR 0.28, 95 % CI 0.1-0.77) and an unplanned readmission (OR 0.08, 95 % CI 0.01-0.67), as well as the total charges (79 % of the IA, 95 % CI 63-100) for those who did not have an IAA at admission. In children with an IAA, there was no difference between EA and IA. However, heterogeneity of treatment effect was present regarding IAA at presentation. CONCLUSIONS: While EA appears to improve outcomes in patients without an abscess, the published data support no significant difference in outcomes between EA and IA in patients with an abscess.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that probiotics may improve gastrointestinal discomfort. Not all probiotics exhibit the same effects and consequently meta-analyses on probiotics should be confined to well-defined strains or strain combinations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a probiotic fermented milk (PFM) that includes Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis) CNCM I-2494 and lactic acid bacteria on gastrointestinal discomfort in the general adult population. METHODS: Double-blind randomized controlled trials in the general adult population comparing PFM with a control dairy product for at least 4 weeks were searched from multiple literature databases (up to February 2015). Meta-analyses using random-effects models, with individual participant data were undertaken to calculate an odds ratio (OR) or standard mean difference (SMD), with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The search strategy identified 12,439 documents. Overall, three trials with a total of 598 adults (female = 96.5%) met the inclusion criteria. Consumption of the PFM product was associated with a significant improvement in overall gastrointestinal discomfort compared with the control product (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.07-2.05), with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10.24 (95% CI 5.64-55.93). PFM was also superior to the control in reducing digestive symptoms, as measured using a composite score (SMD = -0.21; 95% CI -0.37 to -0.05). Sensitivity analyses produced similar results, and the heterogeneity between studies was minimal. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that the consumption of PFM with B. lactis CNCM I-2494 and lactic acid bacteria is associated with a modest but consistent and significant improvement of outcomes related to gastrointestinal discomfort in healthy adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Almost nothing is known about the potential negative effects of Internet-based psychological treatments for depression. This study aims at investigating deterioration and its moderators within randomized trials on Internet-based guided self-help for adult depression, using an individual patient data meta-analyses (IPDMA) approach. METHOD: Studies were identified through systematic searches (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library). Deterioration in participants was defined as a significant symptom increase according to the reliable change index (i.e. 7.68 points in the CES-D; 7.63 points in the BDI). Two-step IPDMA procedures, with a random-effects model were used to pool data. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies (21 comparisons, 2079 participants) contributed data to the analysis. The risk for a reliable deterioration from baseline to post-treatment was significantly lower in the intervention v. control conditions (3.36 v. 7.60; relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.29-0.75). Education moderated effects on deterioration, with patients with low education displaying a higher risk for deterioration than patients with higher education. Deterioration rates for patients with low education did not differ statistically significantly between intervention and control groups. The benefit-risk ratio for patients with low education indicated that 9.38 patients achieve a treatment response for each patient experiencing a symptom deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Internet-based guided self-help is associated with a mean reduced risk for a symptom deterioration compared to controls. Treatment and symptom progress of patients with low education should be closely monitored, as some patients might face an increased risk for symptom deterioration. Future studies should examine predictors of deterioration in patients with low education.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunological disturbances are hypothesised to play a role in recurrent miscarriage (RM) and therefore intravenous immunoglubulins (IVIg) have been tested in RM patients. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to investigate the benefits and harms of IVIg versus placebo, no intervention, or treatment as usual in women with RM. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the published literature in all relevant databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials investigating IVIg versus placebo, no intervention, or treatment as usual in women with RM. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We undertook meta-analyses of aggregated data and individual patient data using a two-step approach, and we conducted bias domain assessments and trial sequential analyses to assess the risks of systematic and random errors. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 11 randomised clinical trials. No significant difference in the frequency of no live birth was found when IVIg was compared with placebo or treatment as usual (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75-1.12, p = 0.42). Trial sequential analysis showed that the required information size of 1,008 participants was not obtained. IVIg compared with placebo seems to increase the risk of adverse events. Subgroup analysis suggests that women with RM after a birth (secondary RM) seemed most likely to obtain a potential beneficial effect of IVIg (RR for no live birth 0.77, 95%CI 0.58-1.02, p = 0.06), however, trial sequential analysis showed that insufficient information is presently accrued. CONCLUSION: We cannot recommend or refute IVIg in women with RM. IVIg should therefore be assessed in further randomised clinical trials with positive outcomes before any clinical use is considered.

AB  - Treatment intensification to maximize disease control and reduced intensity approaches to minimize the risk of late sequelae have been evaluated in newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. The influence of these interventions on the risk of secondary malignant neoplasms, progression-free survival and overall survival is reported in the meta-analysis herein, based on individual patient data from 9498 patients treated within 16 randomized controlled trials for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma between 1984 and 2007. Secondary malignant neoplasms were meta-analyzed using Peto's method as time-to-event outcomes. For progression-free and overall survival, hazard ratios derived from each trial using Cox regression were combined by inverse-variance weighting. Five study questions (combined-modality treatment vs. chemotherapy alone; more extended vs. involved-field radiotherapy; radiation at higher doses vs. radiation at 20 Gy; more vs. fewer cycles of the same chemotherapy protocol; standard-dose chemotherapy vs. intensified chemotherapy) were investigated. After a median follow-up of 7.4 years, dose-intensified chemotherapy resulted in better progression-free survival rates (P=0.007) as compared with standard-dose chemotherapy, but was associated with an increased risk of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (P=0.0028). No progression-free or overall survival differences were observed between combined-modality treatment and chemotherapy alone, but more secondary malignant neoplasms were seen after combined-modality treatment (P=0.010). For the remaining three study questions, outcomes and secondary malignancy rates did not differ significantly between treatment strategies. The results of this meta-analysis help to weigh up efficacy and secondary malignancy risk for the choice of first-line treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma patients. However, final conclusions regarding secondary solid tumors require longer follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVE With the advent of new adjunctive therapy, the overall survival of patients harboring spinal column tumors has improved. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the optimal bone graft options following resection of spinal column tumors, due to their relative rarity and because fusion outcomes in this cohort are affected by various factors, such as radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy. Furthermore, bone graft options are often limited following tumor resection because the use of local bone grafts and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are usually avoided in light of microscopic infiltration of tumors into local bone and potential carcinogenicity of BMP. The objective of this study was to review and meta-analyze the relevant clinical literature to provide further clinical insight regarding bone graft options. METHODS A web-based MEDLINE search was conducted in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, which yielded 27 articles with 383 patients. Information on baseline characteristics, tumor histology, adjunctive treatments, reconstruction methods, bone graft options, fusion rates, and time to fusion were collected. Pooled fusion rates (PFRs) and I(2) values were calculated in meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses were also performed if each variable appeared to affect fusion outcomes. Furthermore, data on 272 individual patients were available, which were additionally reviewed and statistically analyzed. RESULTS Overall, fusion rates varied widely from 36.0% to 100.0% due to both inter- and intrastudy heterogeneity, with a PFR of 85.7% (I(2) = 36.4). The studies in which cages were filled with morselized iliac crest autogenic bone graft (ICABG) and/or other bone graft options were used for anterior fusion showed a significantly higher PFR of 92.8, compared with the other studies (83.3%, p = 0.04). In per-patient analysis, anterior plus posterior fusion resulted in a higher fusion rate than anterior fusion only (98.8% vs 86.4%, p < 0.001). Although unmodifiable, RT (90.3% vs 98.6%, p = 0.03) and lumbosacral tumors (74.6% vs 97.9%, p < 0.001) were associated with lower fusion rates in univariate analysis. The mean time to fusion was 5.4 +/- 1.4 months (range 3-9 months), whereas 16 of 272 patients died before the confirmation of solid fusion with a mean survival of 3.1 +/- 2.1 months (range 0.5-6 months). The average time to fusion of patients who received RT and chemotherapy were significantly longer than those who did not receive these adjunctive treatments (RT: 6.1 months vs 4.3 months, p < 0.001; chemotherapy: 6.0 months vs 4.3 months, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Due to inter- and intrastudy heterogeneity in patient, disease, fusion criteria, and treatment characteristics, the optimal surgical techniques and factors predictive of fusion remain unclear. Clearly, future prospective, randomized studies will be necessary to better understand the issues surrounding bone graft selection following resection of spinal column tumors.

AB  - Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may enhance recovery from stroke through neuroprotective mechanisms if administered early, or neurorepair if given later. Several small trials suggest administration is safe but effects on efficacy are unclear. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCT) assessing G-CSF in patients with hyperacute, acute, subacute or chronic stroke, and asked Investigators to share individual patient data on baseline characteristics, stroke severity and type, end-of-trial modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel Index, haematological parameters, serious adverse events and death. Multiple variable analyses were adjusted for age, sex, baseline severity and time-to-treatment. Individual patient data were obtained for 6 of 10 RCTs comprising 196 stroke patients (116 G-CSF, 80 placebo), mean age 67.1 (SD 12.9), 92% ischaemic, median NIHSS 10 (IQR 5-15), randomised 11 days (interquartile range IQR 4-238) post ictus; data from three commercial trials were not shared. G-CSF did not improve mRS (ordinal regression), odds ratio OR 1.12 (95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.96, p = 0.62). There were more patients with a serious adverse event in the G-CSF group (29.6% versus 7.5%, p = 0.07) with no significant difference in all-cause mortality (G-CSF 11.2%, placebo 7.6%, p = 0.4). Overall, G-CSF did not improve stroke outcome in this individual patient data meta-analysis.

AB  - Ample evidence supports the use of Virtual Reality (VR) for anxiety disorders. Nonetheless, currently there is no evidence about moderators or potential negative effects of VR treatment strategies. An Individual Patient Data (IPD) approach was employed with 15 retrieved datasets. The current study sample was composed of 810 patients. Randomized control trials (RCTs) for each primary outcome measure were performed, in addition to moderator analyses of the socio-demographic variables. Deterioration rates were 14 patients (4.0%) in VR, 8 (2.8%) in active control conditions, and 27 (15%) in the WL condition. With regard to receiving treatment, patients in a waiting list control condition had greater odds of deteriorating than in the two active conditions, odds ratios (ORs) 4.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.05, 0.67]. In the case of the socio-demographic variables, none of them were associated with higher or lower odds of deterioration, with the exception of marital status in the WL condition; married people presented a significantly lower probability of deterioration, OR 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.67]. Finally, when comparing pooled effects of VR versus all control conditions, the OR was 0.61 (95% CI 0.31-1.23) in favor of VR, although this result was not statistically significant. This study provides evidence about the deterioration rates of a therapeutic VR approach, showing that the number of deteriorated patients coincides with other therapeutic approaches, and that deterioration is less likely to occur, compared to patients in WL control groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeated measurements of spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Feno) are recommended as part of the management of childhood asthma, but the evidence base for such recommendations is small. We tested the hypothesis that reducing spirometric indices or increasing Feno will predict poor future asthma outcomes. METHODS: A one-stage individual patient data meta-analysis used data from seven randomized controlled trials in which Feno was used to guide asthma treatment; spirometric indices were also measured. Change in %FEV1 and % change in Feno between baseline and 3 months were related to having poor asthma control and to having an asthma exacerbation between 3 and 6 months after baseline. RESULTS: Data were available from 1,112 children (mean age, 12.6 years; mean %FEV1, 94%). A 10% reduction in %FEV1 between baseline and 3 months was associated with 28% increased odds for asthma exacerbation (95% CI, 3-58) and with 21% increased odds for having poor asthma control (95% CI, 0-45) 6 months after baseline. A 50% increase in Feno between baseline and 3 months was associated with 11% increase in odds for poor asthma control 6 months after baseline (95% CI, 0-16). Baseline Feno and %FEV1 were not related to asthma outcomes at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated measurements of %FEV1 that are typically within the "normal" range add to clinical risk assessment of future asthma outcomes in children. The role of repeated Feno measurements is less certain because large changes were associated with small changes in outcome risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Aspirin is a commonly used over-the-counter (OTC) agent for the symptomatic treatment of acute pain, fever, or the common cold, but data regarding safety in this context are limited. In order to characterize the safety of aspirin beyond single-dose or long-term use data, we conducted a meta-analysis of multiple-dose, multiple-day studies of OTC aspirin at a label-approved dosage. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient data from three Bayer-sponsored studies. The meta-analysis was performed in 2015; the individual studies were conducted between 2008 and 2012 and were of a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled design. Patients received a minimum dosage of aspirin of 2000 mg/day over at least 3 days. The endpoints were patient-reported adverse events (AEs) with an emphasis on the system organ class gastrointestinal system. Event incidences were estimated and an analysis of the odds ratios (ORs) and risk differences (RDs) of aspirin versus placebo were performed. RESULTS: Of the 819 patients included, 433 were treated with aspirin and 386 were treated with placebo. The majority of patients (85.7 %) received a median dose of aspirin of 3000 mg/day for 3 days. The incidence of the overall AEs was low and rates were comparable between the aspirin (10.9 %) and placebo (12.4 %) groups [OR: 0.86 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.56, 1.34); RD: -1.49 (95 % CI -6.01, 3.03)]. Gastrointestinal AEs were more common in subjects treated with aspirin (7.4 %) than with placebo (5.4 %), and although this difference did not reach statistical significance, a trend towards increased risk was observed with aspirin use [OR: 1.41 (95 % CI 0.78, 2.54); RD: 2.00 (95 % CI -1.35, 5.35)]. Nausea, upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and diarrhea were the most frequently reported gastrointestinal AEs. There were no reports of serious gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, or ulceration. CONCLUSIONS: The multiple-dose regimen of aspirin used for several days according to the OTC label is well-tolerated by otherwise healthy non-elderly subjects for short-term and symptomatic treatment of pain, fever, and the common cold. There were no reports of serious gastrointestinal complications in either of the groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A marginal interaction between sex and the type of alkylating agent was observed for event-free survival in the Euro-EWING99-R1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide in Ewing sarcoma. To further evaluate this interaction, we performed an individual patient data meta-analysis of RCTs assessing cyclophosphamide versus ifosfamide in any type of cancer. METHODS: A literature search produced two more eligible RCTs (EICESS92 and IRS-IV). The endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS, main endpoint) and overall survival (OS). The hazard ratios (HRs) of the treatment-by-sex interaction and their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were assessed using stratified multivariable Cox models. Heterogeneity of the interaction across age categories and trials was explored. We also assessed this interaction for severe acute toxicity using logistic models. RESULTS: The meta-analysis comprised 1,528 pediatric and young adult sarcoma patients from three RCTs: Euro-EWING99-R1 (n = 856), EICESS92 (n = 155), and IRS-IV (n = 517). There were 224 PFS events in Euro-EWING99-R1 and 200 in the validation set (EICESS92 + IRS-IV), and 171 and 154 deaths in each dataset, respectively. The estimated treatment-by-sex interaction for PFS in Euro-EWING99-R1 (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.00-3.00) was not replicated in the validation set (HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.55-1.72), without heterogeneity across trials (P = 0.62). In the pooled analysis, the treatment-by-sex interaction was not significant (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.89-1.95, P = 0.17), without heterogeneity across age categories (P = 0.88) and trials (P = 0.36). Similar results were observed for OS. No significant treatment-by-sex interaction was observed for leucopenia/neutropenia (P = 0.45), infection (P = 0.64), or renal toxicity (P = 0.20). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis did not confirm the hypothesis of a treatment-by-sex interaction on efficacy or toxicity outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent depressive disorder is prevalent, disabling, and often difficult to treat. The cognitive-behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) is the only psychotherapy specifically developed for its treatment. However, we do not know which of CBASP, antidepressant pharmacotherapy, or their combination is the most efficacious and for which types of patients. This study aims to present personalized prediction models to facilitate shared decision-making in treatment choices to match patients' characteristics and preferences based on individual participant data network metaregression. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials comparing any two of CBASP, pharmacotherapy, or their combination and sought individual participant data from identified trials. The primary outcomes were reduction in depressive symptom severity for efficacy and dropouts due to any reason for treatment acceptability. RESULTS: All 3 identified studies (1,036 participants) were included in the present analyses. On average, the combination therapy showed significant superiority over both monotherapies in terms of efficacy and acceptability, while the latter 2 treatments showed essentially similar results. Baseline depression, anxiety, prior pharmacotherapy, age, and depression subtypes moderated their relative efficacy, which indicated that for certain subgroups of patients either drug therapy or CBASP alone was a recommendable treatment option that is less costly, may have fewer adverse effects and match an individual patient's preferences. An interactive web app (https://kokoro.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/CBASP/prediction/) shows the predicted disease course for all possible combinations of patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Individual participant data network metaregression enables treatment recommendations based on individual patient characteristics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The role of baseline severity as effect modifier in various psychiatric disorders is a topic of controversy and of clinical import. This study aims to examine whether baseline severity modifies the efficacy of various antidepressants for major depression through individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. METHOD: We identified all placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised trials of new generation antidepressants in the acute phase treatment of major depression conducted in Japan and requested their IPD through the public-private partnerships (PPPs) between the relevant academic societies and the pharmaceutical companies. The effect modification by baseline depression severity was examined through six increasingly complex competing mixed-effects models for repeated measures. RESULTS: We identified eleven eligible trials and obtained IPD from six, which compared duloxetine, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine or bupropion against placebo (total n = 2464). The best-fitting model revealed that the interaction between baseline severity and treatment was not statistically significant (coefficient = -0.04, 95% confidence interval: -0.16 to 0.08, P = 0.49). Several sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings. CONCLUSION: We may expect as much benefit from antidepressant treatments for mild, moderate or severe major depression. Clinical practice guidelines will need to take these findings into consideration.

AB  - BackgroundThe influence of baseline severity has been examined for antidepressant medications but has not been studied properly for cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in comparison with pill placebo.AimsTo synthesise evidence regarding the influence of initial severity on efficacy of CBT from all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which CBT, in face-to-face individual or group format, was compared with pill-placebo control in adults with major depression.MethodA systematic review and an individual-participant data meta-analysis using mixed models that included trial effects as random effects. We used multiple imputation to handle missing data.ResultsWe identified five RCTs, and we were given access to individual-level data (n = 509) for all five. The analyses revealed that the difference in changes in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression between CBT and pill placebo was not influenced by baseline severity (interaction P = 0.43). Removing the non-significant interaction term from the model, the difference between CBT and pill placebo was a standardised mean difference of -0.22 (95% CI -0.42 to -0.02, P = 0.03, I(2) = 0%).ConclusionsPatients suffering from major depression can expect as much benefit from CBT across the wide range of baseline severity. This finding can help inform individualised treatment decisions by patients and their clinicians.

AB  - GOALS: The aim of this study was to compare upper gastrointestinal (UGI) versus lower gastrointestinal (LGI) delivery routes of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for refractory or recurrent/relapsing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). BACKGROUND: FMT has been proven to be a safe and highly effective therapeutic option for CDI. Delivery, however, could be via the UGI or LGI routes, and it is unclear as to which route provides better clinical outcome. STUDY: A systematic search for studies that reported the use of FMT for CDI treatment was conducted. Individual patient data that included demographic (age and sex) and clinical (route of FMT delivery, CDI outcome after FMT, and follow-up time) information were obtained. Kaplan-Meier cumulative hazard curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess clinical failure after FMT by the route of delivery. RESULTS: Data from 305 patients treated with FMT (208 via LGI route and 97 via UGI route) for CDI were analyzed. At 30 and 90 days, the risk of clinical failure was 5.6% and 17.9% in the UGI group compared with 4.9% and 8.5% in the LGI delivery route group, respectively. A time-varying analysis suggested a 3-fold increase in hazard of clinical failure for UGI delivery (hazard ratio, 3.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-8.93) in the period after 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: FMT delivered via the LGI seems to be the most effective route for the prevention of recurrence/relapse of CDI. A randomized controlled trial is necessary to confirm whether FMT delivered via the LGI is indeed superior to that delivered via the UGI route.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This review is an update of "Single dose oral ketoprofen and dexketoprofen for acute postoperative pain in adults" last updated in Issue 4, 2009. Ketoprofen is a non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat acute and chronic painful conditions. Dexketoprofen is the (S)-enantiomer, which is believed to confer analgesia. Theoretically dexketoprofen is expected to provide equivalent analgesia to ketoprofen at half the dose, with a consequent reduction in gastrointestinal adverse events. This review is one of a series on oral analgesics for acute postoperative pain. Individual reviews have been brought together in two overviews to provide information about the relative efficacy and harm of the different interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of single dose oral ketoprofen and oral dexketoprofen compared with placebo for acute postoperative pain, using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in the same way, and criteria of efficacy recommended by an in-depth study at the individual patient level. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase from 2009 to 28 March 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and two online clinical trial registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered ketoprofen or dexketoprofen in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently considered studies for inclusion in the review, examined issues of study quality and potential bias, and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ketoprofen and dexketoprofen, compared with placebo, where there were sufficient data. We collected information on the number of participants with at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over six hours, the median time to use of rescue medication, and the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication. We also collected information on adverse events and withdrawals. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE, and created 'Summary of findings' tables. MAIN RESULTS: This updated review included 24 studies; six additional studies added 1001 participants involved in comparisons of ketoprofen or dexketoprofen and placebo, with a 12% increase in participants taking ketoprofen and a 65% increase for dexketoprofen. Most participants (70%) were women. Dental studies typically involved young participants (mean age 20 to 30 years); other types of surgery involved older participants (mean age 37 to 68 years). Overall, we judged the studies at high risk of bias only for small size, which can lead to an overestimation of benefit.Ketoprofen doses ranged between 6.5 mg and 150 mg. The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours with the usual ketoprofen oral dose of 50 mg was 57%, compared to 23% with placebo, giving an NNT of 2.9 (95% CI 2.4 to 3.7) (RR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.1; 594 participants; 8 studies; high quality evidence). Efficacy was significantly better in dental studies (NNT 1.8) than other surgery (NNT 4.2). The proportion of participants using rescue medication within six hours was lower with ketoprofen (32%) than with placebo (75%), giving a number needed to treat to prevent use of rescue medication (NNTp) of 2.3 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.1); 263 participants; 4 studies; high quality evidence). Median time to remedication estimates were poorly reported. Reports of any adverse event were similar with ketoprofen (18%) and placebo (11%) (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.8; 342 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence). No study reported any serious adverse events (very low quality evidence).Dexketoprofen doses ranged between 5 mg and 100 mg. The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours with the usual dexketoprofen oral dose of 20 mg or 25 mg was 52%, compared to 27% with placebo, giving an NNT of 4.1 (95% CI 3.3 to 5.2) (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.2; 1177 participants; 8 studies; high quality evidence). Efficacy was significantly better in dental studies (NNT 2.7) than other surgery (NNT 5.7). The proportion of participants using rescue medication within six hours was lower with dexketoprofen (47%) than placebo (69%), giving an NNTp of 4.7 (95% CI 3.3 to 8.0); 445 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence). Median time to remedication estimates were poorly reported. Reports of any adverse event were similar with dexketoprofen (14%) and placebo (10%) (RR 1.4, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.2; 536 participants, 6 studies; high quality evidence). No study reported any serious adverse events (very low quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Ketoprofen at doses of 25 mg to 100 mg is an effective analgesic in moderate to severe acute postoperative pain with an NNT for at least 50% pain relief of 2.9 with a 50 mg dose. This is similar to that of commonly used NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (NNT 2.5 for 400 mg dose) and diclofenac (NNT 2.7 for 50 mg dose). Dexketoprofen is also effective with an NNT of 4.1 in the dose range 10 mg to 25 mg. Differential efficacy between dental surgery and other types of surgery seen for both drugs is unusual. Both drugs were well tolerated in single doses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an overall poor prognosis. Currently there are 2 ongoing prospective randomized controlled trials that are evaluating the efficacy and safety of sorafenib and selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with yttrium-90 resin microspheres in patients with advanced HCC. The SorAfenib versus Radioembolisation in Advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma (SARAH; 459 patients) trial is being performed in Europe and the SIRt VErsus SorafeNIB (SIRveNIB; 360 patients) trial in the Asia Pacific region. Prospectively combining the results, these trials will not only allow for increased precision to estimate efficacy (in terms of survival), but will also provide increased statistical power for subgroup analyses. OBJECTIVE: To ensure the prospectivity and transparency of the meta-analysis. METHODS: The sirVEnib and SARAH merge PROject (VESPRO) is an individual, patient-data prospective meta-analysis of the SIRveNIB and SARAH randomized trials. The VESPRO protocol includes prespecified hypotheses, inclusion criteria, and outcome measures. The primary outcome measure is overall survival and secondary outcomes include tumor response rate, progression-free survival, progression in the liver as first event, and disease control in the liver. Pooling of toxicity results will allow for robust safety profiles to be established for both therapies, and provides increased statistical power to investigate treatment effects in key subgroups. Analyses will be performed in the intent-to-treat population stratified by trial. RESULTS: Both studies are expected to demonstrate a survival benefit for SIRT together with a better toxicity profile compared with sorafenib. It is also anticipated that liver progression as the first event would be longer in the intervention compared with the control. CONCLUSIONS: As the results of the 2 trials are not yet known, the methodological strength is enhanced, as biases inherent in conventional meta-analyses are avoided. This has the effect of providing this meta-analysis with the advantages of a single, large,randomized study of 819 patients. It is anticipated that the SARAH and SIRveNIB trial results will be published separately and together with the combined meta-analysis results from VESPRO. The combined dataset will allow the effect of the interventions to be explored with improved reliability/precision with respect to prespecified patient and intervention-level characteristics.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Postoperative lymphoceles and further wound complications occur frequently after radical inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND). In various studies, tissue sealants have shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative morbidity. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of tissue sealants in reducing the incidence of postoperative lymphoceles following ILND in patients with melanoma was conducted. Individual patient data was requested to pool the data for meta-analysis appropriately. RESULTS: Thousand seven hundred twenty-nine manuscripts were screened for eligibility. Six RCTs published between 1986 and 2012 were identified including 194 patients for ILND. Only four RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. No study properly defined the term "lymphocele." Tissue sealants failed to influence the duration of drain placement (mean difference [MD] = -3.05 days; z = 1.18; P = 0.24), total drainage volume (MD = 598.39 mL; z = 1.49; P = 0.14), the incidence of postoperative seroma, wound infection and skin necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: No improvement was identified with the use of tissue sealants, however, a valid comparison of the results of included trials was difficult owing to the lack of a definition of the term "lymphocele."

AB  - AIMS: Consensus is lacking regarding the best treatment for coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR). The two most effective treatments are angioplasty with paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) and repeat stenting with drug-eluting stent (DES) but individual trials were not statistically powered for clinical endpoints, results were heterogeneous, and evidence about comparative efficacy and safety in relevant subsets was limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Difference in Anti-restenotic Effectiveness of Drug-eluting stent and drug-coated balloon AngiopLasty for the occUrrence of coronary in-Stent restenosis (DAEDALUS) study was a comprehensive, investigator-initiated, collaborative, individual patient data meta-analysis comparing angioplasty with PCB alone vs. repeat stenting with DES alone for the treatment of coronary ISR. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017075007). All 10 available randomized clinical trials were included with 1976 patients enrolled, 1033 assigned to PCB and 943 to DES. At 3-year follow-up, PCB was associated with a significant increase in the risk of target lesion revascularization (TLR) compared with DES [hazard ratio (HR) 1.32, 95% CI 1.02-1.70, P = 0.035; number-needed-to-harm 28.5]. There was a significant interaction between treatment effect and type of restenosed stent (P = 0.029) with a more marked difference in patients with DES-ISR and comparable effects in patients with bare-metal stent-ISR. At 3-year follow-up, the primary safety endpoint of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion thrombosis was comparable between treatments (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.58-1.09, P = 0.152). A pre-specified subgroup analysis indicated a significant interaction between treatment effect and type of DES used to treat ISR (P = 0.033), with a lower incidence of events associated with PCB compared with first-generation DES and similar effect between PCB and second-generation DES (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.71-1.60, P = 0.764). Long-term all-cause mortality was similar between PCB and DES (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53-1.22, P = 0.310); results were consistent comparing PCB and non-paclitaxel-based DES (HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.80-2.54, P = 0.235). Myocardial infarction and target lesion thrombosis were comparable between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coronary ISR, repeat stenting with DES is moderately more effective than angioplasty with PCB at reducing the need for TLR at 3 years. The incidence of a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion thrombosis was similar between groups. The rates of individual endpoints, including all-cause mortality, were not significantly different between groups.

AB  - Pulmonary coagulopathy is a characteristic feature of lung injury including ventilator-induced lung injury. The aim of this individual patient data meta-analysis is to assess the effects of nebulized anticoagulants on outcome of ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A systematic search of PubMed (1966-2014), Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant publications. Studies evaluating nebulization of anticoagulants in ventilated patients were screened for inclusion, and corresponding authors of included studies were contacted to provide individual patient data. The primary endpoint was the number of ventilator-free days and alive at day 28. Secondary endpoints included hospital mortality, ICU- and hospital-free days at day 28, and lung injury scores at day seven. We constructed a propensity score-matched cohort for comparisons between patients treated with nebulized anticoagulants and controls. Data from five studies (one randomized controlled trial, one open label study, and three studies using historical controls) were included in the meta-analysis, compassing 286 patients. In all studies unfractionated heparin was used as anticoagulant. The number of ventilator-free days and alive at day 28 was higher in patients treated with nebulized heparin compared to patients in the control group (14 [IQR 0-23] vs. 6 [IQR 0-22]), though the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.459). The number of ICU-free days and alive at day 28 was significantly higher, and the lung injury scores at day seven were significantly lower in patients treated with nebulized heparin. In the propensity score-matched analysis, there were no differences in any of the endpoints. This individual patient data meta-analysis provides no convincing evidence for benefit of heparin nebulization in intubated and ventilated ICU patients. The small patient numbers and methodological shortcomings of included studies underline the need for high-quality well-powered randomized controlled trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The CAIRO3 and AIO 0207 trials demonstrated the efficacy of fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab (FP+Bev) maintenance treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. In this individual patient data meta-analysis with updated follow-up, we aim to provide more precise estimates of treatment effects and to identify subgroups that benefit most from maintenance treatment or observation. METHODS: In 871 patients, randomised to FP+Bev maintenance treatment or observation, we investigated whether treatment effect was modified by sex, age, performance status, response to induction treatment, primary tumour location, number of metastatic sites, disease stage and primary tumour resection, serum LDH, platelet count, CEA, and RAS/BRAF mutation status. Primary end point was time to second progression after reintroduction of the induction regimen (PFS2). Secondary end points were first progression-free survival (PFS1) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 68.5 months (IQR 54.6-87.0 months), maintenance treatment was more effective compared with observation in PFS1 (HR 0.40(95% CI 0.34-0.47)) and PFS2 (HR 0.70(0.60-0.81)). No subgroups were identified that did not benefit from maintenance treatment in PFS1 and PFS2; no clinically relevant subgroup effects were observed. Regarding OS, pooled results were not significant (HR 0.91(0.78-1.05)), and the trials showed marked heterogeneity in overall treatment effect and subgroup effects. CONCLUSIONS: FP+Bev maintenance treatment is effective in all patients, regardless of the investigated subgroups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2015, five randomised trials showed efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy over standard medical care in patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of arteries of the proximal anterior circulation. In this meta-analysis we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool individual patient data from these trials to address remaining questions about whether the therapy is efficacious across the diverse populations included. METHODS: We formed the HERMES collaboration to pool patient-level data from five trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, and EXTEND IA) done between December, 2010, and December, 2014. In these trials, patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of the proximal anterior artery circulation were randomly assigned to receive either endovascular thrombectomy within 12 h of symptom onset or standard care (control), with a primary outcome of reduced disability on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days. By direct access to the study databases, we extracted individual patient data that we used to assess the primary outcome of reduced disability on mRS at 90 days in the pooled population and examine heterogeneity of this treatment effect across prespecified subgroups. To account for between-trial variance we used mixed-effects modelling with random effects for parameters of interest. We then used mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression models to calculate common odds ratios (cOR) for the primary outcome in the whole population (shift analysis) and in subgroups after adjustment for age, sex, baseline stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score), site of occlusion (internal carotid artery vs M1 segment of middle cerebral artery vs M2 segment of middle cerebral artery), intravenous alteplase (yes vs no), baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, and time from stroke onset to randomisation. FINDINGS: We analysed individual data for 1287 patients (634 assigned to endovascular thrombectomy, 653 assigned to control). Endovascular thrombectomy led to significantly reduced disability at 90 days compared with control (adjusted cOR 2.49, 95% CI 1.76-3.53; p<0.0001). The number needed to treat with endovascular thrombectomy to reduce disability by at least one level on mRS for one patient was 2.6. Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint showed no heterogeneity of treatment effect across prespecified subgroups for reduced disability (pinteraction=0.43). Effect sizes favouring endovascular thrombectomy over control were present in several strata of special interest, including in patients aged 80 years or older (cOR 3.68, 95% CI 1.95-6.92), those randomised more than 300 min after symptom onset (1.76, 1.05-2.97), and those not eligible for intravenous alteplase (2.43, 1.30-4.55). Mortality at 90 days and risk of parenchymal haematoma and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage did not differ between populations. INTERPRETATION: Endovascular thrombectomy is of benefit to most patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of the proximal anterior circulation, irrespective of patient characteristics or geographical location. These findings will have global implications on structuring systems of care to provide timely treatment to patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. FUNDING: Medtronic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Cerebrovascular Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaborative Group was formed to obtain and analyze individual patient data from the major randomized trials of common antiplatelet regimens after cerebral ischemia. Although the risk of stroke can be reduced by antiplatelet drugs, there continues to be uncertainty about the balance of risk and benefits of different antiplatelet regimens for an individual patient. AIMS: Our aim is to provide clinicians with a thorough evidence-based answer on these therapeutic alternatives. METHODS: We have identified six large randomized trials and plan to meta-analyze the data on an individual patient level. In total, these trials have enrolled 46 948 patients with cerebral ischemia. Uniquely, the Cerebrovascular Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaborative Group has secured access to the individual data of all of these trials, with the participation of key investigators and pharmaceutical companies. Our principal objective includes deriving a reliable estimate of the efficacy of different antiplatelet regimens on key outcomes including serious vascular events, major ischemic events, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS: We propose to redefine composite outcome events, if necessary, to achieve comparability. Further, we aim to build and validate prognostic models for the risk of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage and to build a decision model that may support evidence-based decision making about which antiplatelet regimen would be most effective in different risk groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This paper outlines inclusion criteria, outcome measures, baseline characteristics, and planned statistical analysis.

AB  - A meta-analysis was conducted of individual patient data (n = 3292) from three randomized controlled trials of corifollitropin alfa versus rFSH: Engage (150 microg corifollitropin alfa n = 756; 200 IU rFSH n = 750), Ensure (100 microg corifollitropin alfa n = 268; 150 IU rFSH n = 128), and Pursue (150 microg corifollitropin alfa n = 694; 300 IU rFSH n = 696). Women with regular menstrual cycles aged 18-36 and body weight >60 kg (Engage) or </=60 kg (Ensure), or women aged 35-42 years and body weight >/=50 kg (Pursue), received a single injection (100 microg or 150 microg) of corifollitropin alfa (based on body weight and age) or daily rFSH. The difference (corifollitropin alfa minus rFSH) in the number of oocytes retrieved was +1.0 (95% CI: 0.5-1.5); vital pregnancy rate: -2.2% (95% CI: -5.3%-0.9%); ongoing pregnancy rate: -1.7% (95% CI: -4.7%-1.4%); and live birth rate: -2.0% (95% CI: -5.0%-1.1%). The odds ratio for overall OHSS was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.82-1.61), and for moderate-to-severe OHSS: 1.29 (95% CI: 0.81-2.05). A single dose of corifollitropin alfa for the first 7 days of ovarian stimulation is a generally well-tolerated and similarly effective treatment compared with daily rFSH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biannual vitamin A supplementation is a well-established survival tool for preschool children 6 months and older in vitamin A deficient populations but this schedule misses the opportunity to intervene on most young infant deaths. Randomised trials of neonatal vitamin A supplementation (NVAS) in the first few days of life to assess its impact on under 6-month mortality in low/middle-income countries have had varying results. METHODS: Investigators of 11 published randomised placebo-controlled NVAS trials (n=163 567 children) reanalysed their data according to an agreed plan and pooled the primary outcomes of mortality from supplementation through 6 and 12 months of age using random effects models and meta-regression. One investigator withdrew but allowed use of the data. FINDINGS: Overall there was no effect of NVAS on infant survival through 6 (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.06) or 12 months of age (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08) but results varied by study population characteristics.NVAS significantly reduced 6-month mortality among the trials conducted in Southern Asia (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98), in contexts with moderate or severe vitamin A deficiency (defined as 10% or higher proportion of women with serum retinol <0.7 micromol/L or 5% or more women with night blindness) (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.94), early infant mortality was 30 or more per 1000 live births (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98), 75% or more of infant mortality occurred in the first 6 months of life (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01), or where >32% mothers had no schooling (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96). NVAS did not reduce mortality in the first 6 months of life in trials conducted in Africa, in contexts characterised by a low prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, lower rates of infant mortality and where maternal education was more prevalent. There was a suggestion of increased infant mortality in trials conducted in Africa (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.15).Individual-level characteristics such as sex, birth weight, gestational age and size, age at dosing, parity, time of breast feeding initiation, maternal education and maternal vitamin A supplementation did not modify the impact of NVAS. CONCLUSION: NVAS reduced infant mortality in South Asia, in contexts where the prevalence of maternal vitamin A deficiency is moderate to severe and early infant mortality is high; but it had no beneficial effect on infant survival in Africa, in contexts where the prevalence of maternal vitamin A deficiency is lower, early infant mortality is low.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding patterns of relapse in patients who respond to antidepressant treatment can inform strategies for prevention of relapse. We aimed to identify distinct trajectories of depression severity, assess whether similar or different trajectory classes exist for patients who continued or discontinued active treatment, and test whether clinical predictors of trajectory class membership exist using pooled data from clinical trials. METHODS: We analysed individual patient data from four double-blind discontinuation clinical trials of duloxetine or fluoxetine versus placebo in major depression from before 2012 (n=1462). We modelled trajectories of relapse up to 26 weeks during double-blind treatment. Trajectories of depression severity, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, were identified in the entire sample, and separately in groups in which antidepressants had been continued or discontinued, using growth mixture models. Predictors of trajectory class membership were assessed with weighted logistic regression. FINDINGS: We identified similar relapse trajectories and two trajectories of stable depression scores in the normal range on active medication and on placebo. Active treatment significantly lowered the odds of membership in the relapse trajectory (odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.37-0.61), whereas female sex (1.56, 1.23-2.06), shorter length of time with clinical response by 1 week (1.10, 1.06-1.15), and higher Clinical Global Impression score at baseline (1.28, 1.01-1.62) increased the odds. Overall, the protective effect of antidepressant medication relative to placebo on the risk of being classified as a relapser was about 13% (33% vs 46%). INTERPRETATION: The existence of similar relapse trajectories on active medication and on placebo suggests that there is no specific relapse signature associated with antidepressant discontinuation. Furthermore, continued treatment offers only modest protection against relapse. These data highlight the need to incorporate treatment strategies that prevent relapse as part of the treatment of depression.

AB  - RATIONALE: The meta-Analysis of Cell-based CaRdiac study is the first prospectively declared collaborative multinational database, including individual data of patients with ischemic heart disease treated with cell therapy. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the safety and efficacy of intracoronary cell therapy after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), including individual patient data from 12 randomized trials (ASTAMI, Aalst, BOOST, BONAMI, CADUCEUS, FINCELL, REGENT, REPAIR-AMI, SCAMI, SWISS-AMI, TIME, LATE-TIME; n=1252). METHODS AND RESULTS: The primary end point was freedom from combined major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (including all-cause death, AMI recurrance, stroke, and target vessel revascularization). The secondary end point was freedom from hard clinical end points (death, AMI recurrence, or stroke), assessed with random-effects meta-analyses and Cox regressions for interactions. Secondary efficacy end points included changes in end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and ejection fraction, analyzed with random-effects meta-analyses and ANCOVA. We reported weighted mean differences between cell therapy and control groups. No effect of cell therapy on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (14.0% versus 16.3%; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.18) or death (1.4% versus 2.1%) or death/AMI recurrence/stroke (2.9% versus 4.7%) was identified in comparison with controls. No changes in ejection fraction (mean difference: 0.96%; 95% confidence interval, -0.2 to 2.1), end-diastolic volume, or systolic volume were observed compared with controls. These results were not influenced by anterior AMI location, reduced baseline ejection fraction, or the use of MRI for assessing left ventricular parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized trials in patients with recent AMI revealed that intracoronary cell therapy provided no benefit, in terms of clinical events or changes in left ventricular function.

AB  - Background The recommended maximum age and time window for intravenous alteplase treatment of acute ischemic stroke differs between the Europe Union and United States. Aims We compared the effects of alteplase in cohorts defined by the current Europe Union or United States marketing approval labels, and by hypothetical revisions of the labels that would remove the Europe Union upper age limit or extend the United States treatment time window to 4.5 h. Methods We assessed outcomes in an individual-patient-data meta-analysis of eight randomized trials of intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) versus control for acute ischemic stroke. Outcomes included: excellent outcome (modified Rankin score 0-1) at 3-6 months, the distribution of modified Rankin score, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality. Results Alteplase increased the odds of modified Rankin score 0-1 among 2449/6136 (40%) patients who met the current European Union label and 3491 (57%) patients who met the age-revised label (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.21-1.68 and 1.43, 1.23-1.65, respectively), but not in those outside the age-revised label (1.06, 0.90-1.26). By 90 days, there was no increased mortality in the current and age-revised cohorts (hazard ratios 0.98, 95% CI 0.76-1.25 and 1.01, 0.86-1.19, respectively) but mortality remained higher outside the age-revised label (1.19, 0.99-1.42). Similarly, alteplase increased the odds of modified Rankin score 0-1 among 1174/6136 (19%) patients who met the current US approval and 3326 (54%) who met a 4.5-h revised approval (odds ratio 1.55, 1.19-2.01 and 1.37, 1.17-1.59, respectively), but not for those outside the 4.5-h revised approval (1.14, 0.97-1.34). By 90 days, no increased mortality remained for the current and 4.5-h revised label cohorts (hazard ratios 0.99, 0.77-1.26 and 1.02, 0.87-1.20, respectively) but mortality remained higher outside the 4.5-h revised approval (1.17, 0.98-1.41). Conclusions An age-revised European Union label or 4.5-h-revised United States label would each increase the number of patients deriving net benefit from alteplase by 90 days after acute ischemic stroke, without excess mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radial artery occlusion (RAO) remains the Achilles' heel of transradial coronary procedures. Standard over lower systemic anticoagulation levels are believed to reduce RAO rates but this is ill-supported by scientific evidence. We compared whether standard in comparison with less intensive anticoagulation was superior in preventing vessel closure. METHODS AND RESULTS: The two arms of this analysis included 731 pooled patients with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria. We assessed forearm arterial access site occlusion rate by unfractionated heparin (UFH) dose in an individual participant data meta-analysis of this randomized study and of consecutive eligible patients from our previous trial. We randomized 308 consecutive patients undergoing transradial coronary angiography with 5 French (5 Fr) catheters without need to crossover to receive 2500 or 5000 UFH units. The primary end-point was the ultrasonographically determined vessel occlusion rate. Incident RAOs in the randomized arm were 15.9% vs. 14%, in the low and standard UFH dose, respectively (p=0.7). Corresponding figures for forearm arterial occlusion rates in the pooled population were 13.0% vs. 9.9% (relative risk: 1.3, 95% confidence interval - CI: 0.88-1.98; p=0.2). Procedural and fluoroscopy duration was less than 15 and 3 min, respectively. The mean UFH dose difference was 3.52 (95% CI: -0.45 to 7.49) units per kilo body weight between occluded (n=84) and patent forearm arteries (n=647); (p=0.053). CONCLUSIONS: Incident forearm arterial occlusions were high despite using 5 Fr catheters for a short-lasting procedure. Systemic anticoagulation with standard over lower UFH dose did not reduce the frequency of RAOs after coronary angiography.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preventive chemotherapy and transmission control (PCT) by mass drug administration is the cornerstone of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s policy to control soil-transmitted helminthiases (STHs) caused by Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) and hookworm species (Necator americanus and Ancylostama duodenale) which affect over 1 billion people globally. Despite consensus that drug efficacies should be monitored for signs of decline that could jeopardise the effectiveness of PCT, systematic monitoring and evaluation is seldom implemented. Drug trials mostly report aggregate efficacies in groups of participants, but heterogeneities in design complicate classical meta-analyses of these data. Individual participant data (IPD) permit more detailed analysis of drug efficacies, offering increased sensitivity to identify atypical responses potentially caused by emerging drug resistance. METHODOLOGY: We performed a systematic literature review to identify studies concluding after 2000 that collected IPD suitable for estimating drug efficacy against STH. We included studies that administered a variety of anthelmintics with follow ups less than 60 days after treatment. We estimated the number of IPD and extracted cohort- and study-level meta-data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We estimate that there exist individual data on approximately 35,000 participants from 129 studies conducted in 39 countries, including 34 out of 103 countries where PCT is recommended. We find significant heterogeneity in diagnostic methods, times of outcome assessment, and the reported measure of efficacy. We also quantify cohorts comprising pre-school age children, pregnant women, and co-infected participants, including with HIV. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that establishing a global IPD repository would improve the capacity to monitor and evaluate the efficacy of anthelmintic drugs, respond to changes and safeguard the ongoing effectiveness of PCT. Establishing a fair, transparent data governance policy will be key for the engagement of the global STH community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approved doses of antidepressants in Japan are usually lower than those in the USA and European Union, but to date meta-analyses comparing antidepressants have all used the higher doses approved in the USA and European Union and often have used indirect comparisons. The purpose of this study was to conduct an integrated database analysis of patient level data to compare the effects of duloxetine with those of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at the doses approved in Japan. METHODS: Pooled data were analyzed from four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that compared duloxetine at the dose range approved in Japan (40-60 mg/day) with other SSRIs (paroxetine 20 mg/day or escitalopram 10 mg/day) and placebo in patients with major depressive disorder. In total, 1,694 patients were included in the analysis (duloxetine, n=688; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, n=690; placebo, n=316). The primary outcome measure was the mean change from baseline at week 8 in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17) total and subscale scores. RESULTS: Duloxetine and both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were superior to placebo in HAMD17 total score at week 8 in both the all-randomized group and the more severe subgroup (HAMD17 total scores >/=19). Duloxetine was superior to SSRIs in improving the HAMD17 Retardation subscale score (least squares mean difference [95% confidence interval]): all-randomized group, -0.33 [-0.60, -0.07], P=0.015; severe subgroup, -0.45 [-0.83, -0.07], P=0.020). CONCLUSION: Within the dose range approved in Japan for patients with major depressive disorder, duloxetine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors demonstrated comparable overall efficacy, with a possible advantage for duloxetine in improving loss of energy and interest. To the best of our knowledge, this analysis is unique not only in evaluating dosages specific to Japan, but also in using individual patient data and the same endpoint across studies to allow for strictly direct head-to-head data comparisons as opposed to pooling direct and indirect comparisons.

AB  - Aims: Despite patient reports of neurocognitive disorders with lipid-lowering treatments (LLTs), large clinical trials have found no significant association between neurocognitive disorders and LLTs. We assessed incidence of neurocognitive treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from 14 Phase 2 and 3 trials of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor alirocumab. Methods and results: Patients (most on background maximally tolerated statin) received alirocumab 75/150 mg every 2 weeks (n = 3340; 4029 patient-years of exposure), placebo (n = 1276), or ezetimibe (n = 618). Data were pooled by the control used. Neurocognitive TEAEs were reported by 22 (0.9%) alirocumab-treated patients vs. 9 (0.7%) with placebo in placebo-controlled trials [hazard ratio (HR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-2.68] and 10 (1.2%) with alirocumab vs. 8 (1.3%) with ezetimibe in ezetimibe-controlled trials (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.32-2.08). Rates of neurocognitive TEAEs were similar in patients receiving alirocumab with LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L; n = 5/839; 0.6%; 0.5/100 patient-years) vs. >/=25 mg/dL (n = 26/2501; 1.0%; 0.8/100 patient-years). One patient (0.1%; ezetimibe-controlled pool) receiving alirocumab had a neurocognitive TEAE leading to discontinuation vs. two (0.2%) patients receiving placebo and three (0.4%) patients receiving ezetimibe. Neurocognitive TEAE incidence was also similar between alirocumab and controls when stratified by age. Conclusions: Neurocognitive TEAE incidences were low (</=1.2%), with no significant differences between alirocumab vs. controls up to 104 weeks. No association was found between neurocognitive TEAEs and LDL-C <25 mg/dL based on the completed Phase 2 and 3 trials examined, although long-term effects of very low LDL-C levels induced by PCSK9 inhibitors are currently unknown.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Change in albuminuria has strong biological plausibility as a surrogate endpoint for progression of chronic kidney disease, but empirical evidence to support its validity is lacking. We aimed to determine the association between treatment effects on early changes in albuminuria and treatment effects on clinical endpoints and surrograte endpoints, to inform the use of albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint in future randomised controlled trials. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we searched PubMed for publications in English from Jan 1, 1946, to Dec 15, 2016, using search terms including "chronic kidney disease", "chronic renal insufficiency", "albuminuria", "proteinuria", and "randomized controlled trial"; key inclusion criteria were quantifiable measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria at baseline and within 12 months of follow-up and information on the incidence of end-stage kidney disease. We requested use of individual patient data from the authors of eligible studies. For all studies that the authors agreed to participate and that had sufficient data, we estimated treatment effects on 6-month change in albuminuria and the composite clinical endpoint of treated end-stage kidney disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), or doubling of serum creatinine. We used a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression analysis to relate the treatment effects on albuminuria to those on the clinical endpoint across studies and developed a prediction model for the treatment effect on the clinical endpoint on the basis of the treatment effect on albuminuria. FINDINGS: We identified 41 eligible treatment comparisons from randomised trials (referred to as studies) that provided sufficient patient-level data on 29 979 participants (21 206 [71%] with diabetes). Over a median follow-up of 3.4 years (IQR 2.3-4.2), 3935 (13%) participants reached the composite clinical endpoint. Across all studies, with a meta-regression slope of 0.89 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 0.13-1.70), each 30% decrease in geometric mean albuminuria by the treatment relative to the control was associated with an average 27% lower hazard for the clinical endpoint (95% BCI 5-45%; median R(2) 0.47, 95% BCI 0.02-0.96). The association strengthened after restricting analyses to patients with baseline albuminuria of more than 30 mg/g (ie, 3.4 mg/mmol; R(2) 0.72, 0.05-0.99]). For future trials, the model predicts that treatments that decrease the geometric mean albuminuria to 0.7 (ie, 30% decrease in albuminuria) relative to the control will provide an average hazard ratio (HR) for the clinical endpoint of 0.68, and 95% of sufficiently large studies would have HRs between 0.47 and 0.95. INTERPRETATION: Our results support a role for change in albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint for the progression of chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with high baseline albuminuria; for patients with low baseline levels of albuminuria this association is less certain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous meta-analysis of 3 zinc acetate lozenge trials estimated that colds were on average 40% shorter for the zinc groups. However, the duration of colds is a time outcome, and survival analysis may be a more informative approach. The objective of this individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was to estimate the effect of zinc acetate lozenges on the rate of recovery from colds. METHODS: We analyzed IPD for 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials in which 80-92 mg/day of elemental zinc were administered as zinc acetate lozenges to 199 common cold patients. We used mixed-effects Cox regression to estimate the effect of zinc. RESULTS: Patients administered zinc lozenges recovered faster by rate ratio 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.1-4.7). The effect was not modified by age, sex, race, allergy, smoking, or baseline common cold severity. On the 5th day, 70% of the zinc patients had recovered compared with 27% of the placebo patients. Accordingly, 2.6 times more patients were cured in the zinc group. The difference also corresponds to the number needed to treat of 2.3 on the 5th day. None of the studies observed serious adverse effects of zinc. CONCLUSIONS: The 3-fold increase in the rate of recovery from the common cold is a clinically important effect. The optimal formulation of zinc lozenges and an ideal frequency of their administration should be examined. Given the evidence of efficacy, common cold patients may be instructed to try zinc acetate lozenges within 24 hours of onset of symptoms.

AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine whether the allergy status and other characteristics of common cold patients modify the effects of zinc acetate lozenges. METHODS: We had available individual patient data for three randomized placebo-controlled trials in which zinc acetate lozenges were administered to common cold patients. We used both one stage and two stage meta-analysis to estimate the effects of zinc lozenges. RESULTS: The total number of common cold patients was 199, the majority being females. Eighty percent of them fell into the age range 20-50 years. One third of the patients had allergies. The one stage meta-analysis gave an overall estimate of 2.73 days (95% CI 1.8, 3.3 days) shorter colds by zinc acetate lozenge usage. The two stage meta-analysis gave an estimate of 2.94 days (95% CI 2.1, 3.8 days) reduction in common cold duration. These estimates are to be compared with the 7 day average duration of colds in the three trials. The effect of zinc lozenges was not modified by allergy status, smoking, baseline severity of the common cold, age, gender or ethnic group. CONCLUSION: Since the effects of zinc acetate lozenges were consistent between the compared subgroups, the overall estimates for effect seemed applicable over a wide range of common cold patients. While the optimal composition of zinc lozenges and the best frequency of their administration should be further investigated, given the current evidence of efficacy, common cold patients may be encouraged to try zinc lozenges for treating their colds.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) are stockpiled and recommended by public health agencies for treating and preventing seasonal and pandemic influenza. They are used clinically worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To (1) describe the potential benefits and harms of NIs for influenza in all age groups by reviewing all clinical study reports (CSRs) of published and unpublished randomised, placebo-controlled trials and regulatory comments; and (2) determine the effect of oseltamivir (Tamiflu((R)), Roche) treatment on mortality in patients with 2009A/H1N1 influenza. METHODS: We searched trial registries, electronic databases and corresponded with regulators and sponsors to identify randomised trials of NIs. We requested full CSRs and accessed regulators' comments. We included only those trials for which we had CSRs. To examine the effects of oseltamivir on 2009A/H1N1 influenza mortality, we requested individual patient data (IPD) from corresponding authors of all included observational studies. RESULTS: Effect of oseltamivir and zanamivir (Relenza(R), GlaxoSmithKline) in the prevention and treatment of influenza: Oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults by 16.8 hours [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.4 to 25.1 hours]. Zanamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults by 0.60 days (95% CI 0.39 to 0.81 days). Oseltamivir reduced unverified pneumonia in adult treatment [risk difference (RD) 1.00%, 95% CI 0.22% to 1.49%]; similar findings were observed with zanamivir prophylaxis in adults (RD 0.32%, 95% CI 0.09% to 0.41%). Oseltamivir treatment of adults increased the risk of nausea (RD 3.66%, 95% CI 0.90% to 7.39%) and vomiting (RD 4.56%, 95% CI 2.39% to 7.58%). In the treatment of children, oseltamivir induced vomiting (RD 5.34%, 95% CI 1.75% to 10.29%). Both oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis reduced the risk of symptomatic influenza in individuals (oseltamivir RD 3.05%, 95% CI 1.83% to 3.88%; zanamivir RD 1.98%, 95% CI 0.98% to 2.54%) and in households (oseltamivir RD 13.6%, 95% CI 9.52% to 15.47%; zanamivir RD 14.84%, 95% CI 12.18% to 16.55%). Oseltamivir increased psychiatric adverse events in the combined on- and off-treatment periods (RD 1.06%, 95% CI 0.07% to 2.76%) and the risk of headaches while on treatment (RD 3.15%, 95% CI 0.88% to 5.78%). Effect of oseltamivir on mortality in patients with 2009A/H1N1 influenza: Analysis of summary data of 30 studies as well as IPD of four studies showed evidence of time-dependent bias. After adjusting for time-dependent bias and potential confounding variables, competing risks analysis of the IPD showed insufficient evidence that oseltamivir reduced the risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.65). CONCLUSIONS: Oseltamivir and zanamivir cause small reductions in the time to first alleviation of influenza symptoms in adults. The use of oseltamivir increases the risk of nausea, vomiting, psychiatric events in adults and vomiting in children. Oseltamivir has no protective effect on mortality among patients with 2009A/H1N1 influenza. Prophylaxis with either NI may reduce symptomatic influenza in individuals and in households. The balance between benefits and harms should be considered when making decisions about use of NIs for either prophylaxis or treatment of influenza.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preventing exacerbations is an important goal of asthma treatment. Long-term treatment with azithromycin may help achieve this. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of azithromycin in reducing exacerbations in asthma, and the sub-phenotypes of non-eosinophilic asthma, eosinophilic asthma and severe asthma. METHOD: We completed a systematic search of EMBASE, Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrails.gov and reference lists of previous systematic reviews in February 2019. We included parallel-group double-blind randomised controlled trials in adults comparing at least 8 weeks of azithromycin treatment with placebo, where the outcome of exacerbations was assessed over at least 6 months. Data were extracted from published sources, Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied and IPD were sought from authors. Reviews were undertaken in duplicate. We conducted an IPD meta-analysis on the primary outcome of exacerbations and a random effects meta-analysis for secondary outcomes. PROSPERO registration: CRD42018075259. RESULTS: Three studies were identified (N=597). In the IPD meta-analysis, treatment with azithromycin was associated with a reduced rate of exacerbations (oral corticosteroid course due to worsening asthma, antibiotic use for lower respiratory tract infection, hospitalisation, and/or emergency room visits) in asthma and in the non-eosinophilic, eosinophilic and severe asthma subgroups. Examining each exacerbation type separately, patients with eosinophilic asthma reported fewer oral corticosteroids courses and patients with non-eosinophilic and severe asthma reported fewer antibiotic courses. Azithromycin was well tolerated. DISCUSSION: Maintenance use of azithromycin reduces exacerbations in patients with eosinophilic, non-eosinophilic and severe asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the early time course of major bleeding and its subtypes in patients with cerebral ischemia on dual and single antiplatelet therapy. METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis on individual patient data from 6 randomized clinical trials (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events [CAPRIE], Second European Stroke Prevention Study [ESPS-2], Management of Atherothrombosis With Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients [MATCH], Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance [CHARISMA], European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischaemia Trial [ESPRIT], and Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes [PRoFESS]) including 45,195 patients with a TIA or noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. We studied incidence rates of bleeding per antiplatelet regimen stratified by time from randomization (</=30, 31-90, 91-180, 181-365, >365 days). We calculated incidence rates per trial and pooled estimates with random-effects meta-analysis. We performed Poisson regression to assess differences between time periods with adjustment for age and sex. RESULTS: The incidence of major bleeding on aspirin plus clopidogrel and aspirin plus -dipyridamole was highest in the first 30 days, 5.8 and 4.9 per 100 person-years, respectively, and was significantly higher than at 31 to 90 days (rate ratio 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.16-3.40 for aspirin plus clopidogrel; rate ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.24-3.03 for aspirin plus dipyridamole). Incidence rates on aspirin and clopidogrel monotherapy were 2.8 and 2.5 per 100 person-years, respectively, in the first 30 days, with no significant change over time. The time course was similar for gastrointestinal bleeds. There was no early excess of intracranial hemorrhage in patients on either dual or single antiplatelet therapy. CONCLUSION: Dual antiplatelet therapy is associated with high early risks of major and gastrointestinal bleeding that decline after the first month in trial cohorts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Age was reported to be an effect-modifier in four randomised controlled trials comparing carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA), with better CEA outcomes than CAS outcomes noted in the more elderly patients. We aimed to describe the association of age with treatment differences in symptomatic patients and provide age-specific estimates of the risk of stroke and death within narrow (5 year) age groups. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we analysed individual patient-level data from four randomised controlled trials within the Carotid Stenosis Trialists' Collaboration (CSTC) involving patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. We included only trials that randomly assigned patients to CAS or CEA and only patients with symptomatic stenosis. We assessed rates of stroke or death in 5-year age groups in the periprocedural period (between randomisation and 120 days) and ipsilateral stroke during long-term follow-up for patients assigned to CAS or CEA. We also assessed differences between CAS and CEA. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. FINDINGS: Collectively, 4754 patients were randomly assigned to either CEA or CAS treatment in the four studies. 433 events occurred over a median follow-up of 2.7 years. For patients assigned to CAS, the periprocedural hazard ratio (HR) for stroke and death in patients aged 65-69 years compared with patients younger than 60 years was 2.16 (95% CI 1.13-4.13), with HRs of roughly 4.0 for patients aged 70 years or older. We noted no evidence of an increased periprocedural risk by age group in the CEA group (p=0.34). These changes underpinned a CAS-versus CEA periprocedural HR of 1.61 (95% CI 0.90-2.88) for patients aged 65-69 years and an HR of 2.09 (1.32-3.32) for patients aged 70-74 years. Age was not associated with the postprocedural stroke risk either within treatment group (p>/=0.09 for CAS and 0.83 for CEA), or between treatment groups (p=0.84). INTERPRETATION: In these RCTs, CEA was clearly superior to CAS in patients aged 70-74 years and older. The difference in older patients was almost wholly attributable to increasing periprocedural stroke risk in patients treated with CAS. Age had little effect on CEA periprocedural risk or on postprocedural risk after either procedure. FUNDING: None.

AB  - Therapeutic-continuous positive airway pressure seems to increase weight compared with placebo-continuous positive airway pressure. It is not known whether weight gain with therapeutic-continuous positive airway pressure dose is dependent or whether it causes metabolic dysfunction. Data synthesis of three randomised placebo-continuous positive airway pressure-controlled trials (2-3 months) was performed to test whether there is a dose-dependent effect of continuous positive airway pressure on weight. Fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment), lipids and visceral abdominal fat were also tested to determine any effect on metabolic function. Mixed-model analysis of variance was used to quantify these effects. One-hundred and twenty-eight patients were analysed. Overall there was a small increase in weight with therapeutic-continuous positive airway pressure use compared with placebo-continuous positive airway pressure (difference: 1.17 kg; 0.37-1.97, p = 0.005), which was greater with high-use therapeutic-continuous positive airway pressure compared with high-use placebo-continuous positive airway pressure (1.45 kg; 0.10-2.80, p = 0.04). Continuous positive airway pressure use as a continuous variable was also significantly associated with weight change in continuous positive airway pressure users (0.30 kg hr(-1) night(-1) ; 0.04-0.56, p = 0.001), but not in placebo users (0.04 kg hr(-1) night(-1) ; -0.22 to 0.26, p = 0.76). Neither therapeutic-continuous positive airway pressure nor the dose of therapeutic-continuous positive airway pressure caused any changes to metabolic outcomes. The weight gain effects of medium-term therapeutic-continuous positive airway pressure appear modest and are not accompanied by any adverse metabolic effects.

AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) on reintubation in adult patients. PROCEDURES: Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched up to November 1, 2016, for RCTs comparing HFNC versus conventional oxygen therapy (COT) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in adult patients after extubation. The primary outcome was reintubation rate, and the secondary outcomes included complications, tolerance and comfort, time to reintubation, length of stay, and mortality. Dichotomous outcomes were presented as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous outcomes as weighted mean difference and 95% CIs. The random effects model was used for data pooling. FINDINGS: Seven RCTs involving 2781 patients were included in the analysis. The HFNC had a similar reintubation rate compared to either COT (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.21-1.60; P = .29; 5 RCTs, n = 1347) or NIV (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.88-1.40; P = .37; 2 RCTs, n = 1434). In subgroup of critically ill patients, the HFNC group had a significantly lower reintubation rate compared to the COT group (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.19-0.64; P = .0007; 2 RCTs, n = 632; interaction P = .07 compared to postoperative subgroup). Qualitative analysis suggested that HFNC might be associated with less complications and improved patient's tolerance and comfort. The HFNC might not delay reintubation. Trial sequential analysis on the primary outcome showed that required information size was not reached. CONCLUSION: The evidence suggests that COT may still be the first-line therapy in postoperative patients without acute respiratory failure. However, in critically ill patients, HFNC may be a potential alternative respiratory support to COT and NIV, with the latter often associating with patient intolerance and requiring a monitored setting. Because required information size was not reached, further high-quality studies are required to confirm these results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tenecteplase, a modified plasminogen activator with higher fibrin specificity and longer half-life, may have advantages over alteplase in acute ischemic stroke thrombolysis. AIMS: We undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared alteplase with tenecteplase in acute stroke. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified by a MEDLINE search, and individual patient data were acquired. We compared clinical outcomes including modified Rankin Scale at three months, early neurological improvement at 24 h, intracerebral hemorrhage, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and mortality at three months between all dose tiers of tenecteplase and alteplase. RESULTS: Three relevant studies (Haley et al., Parsons et al., and ATTEST) included 291 patients and investigated three doses of tenecteplase (0.1, 0.25, 0.4 mg/kg). There were no differences between any dose of tenecteplase and alteplase for either efficacy or safety end points. Tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg had the greatest odds to achieve early neurological improvement (OR [95%CI] 3.3 [1.5, 7.2], p = 0.093), excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-1) at three months (OR [95%CI] 1.9 [0.8, 4.4], p = 0.28), with reduced odds of intracerebral hemorrhage (OR [95%CI] 0.6 [0.2, 1.8], P = 0.43) compared with alteplase. Only 19 patients were treated with tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg, which showed increased odds of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage compared with alteplase (OR [95% CI] 6.2 [0.7, 56.3]). CONCLUSIONS: While no significant differences between tenecteplase and alteplase were found, point estimates suggest potentially greater efficacy of 0.25 and 0.1 mg/kg doses with no difference in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and potentially higher symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage risk with the 0.4 mg/kg dose. Further investigation of 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For over 2 decades, brief motivational interventions (BMIs) have been implemented on college campuses to reduce heavy drinking and related negative consequences. Such interventions include in-person motivational interviews (MIs), often incorporating personalized feedback (PF), and stand-alone PF interventions delivered via mail, computer, or the Web. Both narrative and meta-analytic reviews using aggregate data from published studies suggest at least short-term efficacy of BMIs, although overall effect sizes have been small. METHODS: This study was an individual participant-level data (IPD) meta-analysis of 17 randomized clinical trials evaluating BMIs. Unlike typical meta-analysis based on summary data, IPD meta-analysis allows for an analysis that correctly accommodates the sampling, sample characteristics, and distributions of the pooled data. In particular, highly skewed distributions with many zeroes are typical for drinking outcomes, but have not been adequately accounted for in existing studies. Data are from Project INTEGRATE, one of the largest IPD meta-analysis projects to date in alcohol intervention research, representing 6,713 individuals each with 2 to 5 repeated measures up to 12 months postbaseline. RESULTS: We used Bayesian multilevel over dispersed Poisson hurdle models to estimate intervention effects on drinks per week and peak drinking, and Gaussian models for alcohol problems. Estimates of overall intervention effects were very small and not statistically significant for any of the outcomes. We further conducted post hoc comparisons of 3 intervention types (individual MI with PF, PF only, and group MI) versus control. There was a small, statistically significant reduction in alcohol problems among participants who received an individual MI with PF. Short-term and long-term results were similar. CONCLUSIONS: This study questions the efficacy and magnitude of effects of BMIs for college drinking prevention and intervention and suggests a need for the development of more effective intervention strategies.

AB  - Purpose Following the Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomized Protocol (SHARP) trial, sorafenib has become the standard of care for patients with advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, but the relation between survival advantage and disease etiology remains unclear. To address this, we undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis of three large prospective randomized trials in which sorafenib was the control arm. Methods Of a total of 3,256 patients, 1,643 (50%) who received sorafenib were available. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). A Bayesian hierarchical approach for individual patient data meta-analyses was applied using a piecewise exponential model. Results are presented in terms of hazard ratios comparing sorafenib with alternative therapies according to hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) status. Results Hazard ratios show improved OS for sorafenib in patients who are both HBV negative and HCV positive (log [hazard ratio], -0.27; 95% CI, -0.46 to -0.06). Median unadjusted survival is 12.6 (11.15 to 13.8) months for sorafenib and 10.2 (8.88 to 12.2) months for "other" treatments in this subgroup. There was no evidence of improvement in OS for any other patient subgroups defined by HBV and HCV. Results were consistent across all trials with heterogeneity assessed using Cochran's Q statistic. Conclusion There is consistent evidence that the effect of sorafenib on OS is dependent on patients' hepatitis status. There is an improved OS for patients negative for HBV and positive for HCV when treated with sorafenib. There was no evidence of any improvement in OS attributable to sorafenib for patients positive for HBV and negative for HCV.

AB  - OBJECTIVETo determine whether probiotic prophylaxes reduce the odds of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in adults and children.DESIGNIndividual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), adjusting for risk factors.METHODSWe searched 6 databases and 11 grey literature sources from inception to April 2016. We identified 32 RCTs (n=8,713); among them, 18 RCTs provided IPD (n=6,851 participants) comparing probiotic prophylaxis to placebo or no treatment (standard care). One reviewer prepared the IPD, and 2 reviewers extracted data, rated study quality, and graded evidence quality.RESULTSProbiotics reduced CDI odds in the unadjusted model (n=6,645; odds ratio [OR] 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.55) and the adjusted model (n=5,074; OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.23-0.55). Using 2 or more antibiotics increased the odds of CDI (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.11-4.37), whereas age, sex, hospitalization status, and high-risk antibiotic exposure did not. Adjusted subgroup analyses suggested that, compared to no probiotics, multispecies probiotics were more beneficial than single-species probiotics, as was using probiotics in clinical settings where the CDI risk is >/=5%. Of 18 studies, 14 reported adverse events. In 11 of these 14 studies, the adverse events were retained in the adjusted model. Odds for serious adverse events were similar for both groups in the unadjusted analyses (n=4,990; OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.89-1.26) and adjusted analyses (n=4,718; OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.89-1.28). Missing outcome data for CDI ranged from 0% to 25.8%. Our analyses were robust to a sensitivity analysis for missingness.CONCLUSIONSModerate quality (ie, certainty) evidence suggests that probiotic prophylaxis may be a useful and safe CDI prevention strategy, particularly among participants taking 2 or more antibiotics and in hospital settings where the risk of CDI is >/=5%.TRIAL REGISTRATIONPROSPERO 2015 identifier: CRD42015015701Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2018;771-781.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous aggregate data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials showed that vitamin D supplementation reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Whether this effect is restricted to patients with low baseline vitamin D status is unknown. METHODS: For this systematic review and one-step and two-step meta-analysis of individual participant data, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science for double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trials of vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 supplementation in people with asthma that reported incidence of asthma exacerbation, published between database inception and Oct 26, 2016. We analysed individual participant data requested from the principal investigator for each eligible trial, adjusting for age and sex, and clustering by study. The primary outcome was the incidence of asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Mixed-effects regression models were used to obtain the pooled intervention effect with a 95% CI. Subgroup analyses were done to determine whether effects of vitamin D on risk of asthma exacerbation varied according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration, age, ethnic or racial origin, body-mass index, vitamin D dosing regimen, use of inhaled corticosteroids, or end-study 25(OH)D levels; post-hoc subgroup analyses were done according to sex and study duration. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014013953. FINDINGS: Our search identified 483 unique studies, eight of which were eligible randomised controlled trials (total 1078 participants). We sought individual participant data for each and obtained it for seven studies (955 participants). Vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids among all participants (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.97; p=0.03; 955 participants in seven studies; high-quality evidence). There were no significant differences between vitamin D and placebo in the proportion of participants with at least one exacerbation or time to first exacerbation. Subgroup analyses of the rate of asthma exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids revealed that protective effects were seen in participants with baseline 25(OH)D of less than 25 nmol/L (aIRR 0.33, 0.11-0.98; p=0.046; 92 participants in three studies; moderate-quality evidence) but not in participants with higher baseline 25(OH)D levels (aIRR 0.77, 0.58-1.03; p=0.08; 764 participants in six studies; moderate-quality evidence; pinteraction=0.25). p values for interaction for all other subgroup analyses were also higher than 0.05; therefore, we did not show that the effects of this intervention are stronger in any one subgroup than in another. Six studies were assessed as being at low risk of bias, and one was assessed as being at unclear risk of bias. The two-step meta-analysis did not reveal evidence of heterogeneity of effect (I(2)=0.0, p=0.56). INTERPRETATION: Vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids overall. We did not find definitive evidence that effects of this intervention differed across subgroups of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been widely used; however, recent trials have questioned its value and safety. In this meta-analysis, we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool the individual patient data from these trials to determine the benefits and risks of thrombus aspiration during PCI in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. METHODS: Included were large (n>/=1000), randomized, controlled trials comparing manual thrombectomy and PCI alone in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. Individual patient data were provided by the leadership of each trial. The prespecified primary efficacy outcome was cardiovascular mortality within 30 days, and the primary safety outcome was stroke or transient ischemic attack within 30 days. RESULTS: The 3 eligible randomized trials (TAPAS [Thrombus Aspiration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction], TASTE [Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia], and TOTAL [Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy With PCI Versus PCI Alone in Patients With STEMI]) enrolled 19 047 patients, of whom 18 306 underwent PCI and were included in the primary analysis. Cardiovascular death at 30 days occurred in 221 of 9155 patients (2.4%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 262 of 9151 (2.9%) randomized to PCI alone (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-1.01; P=0.06). Stroke or transient ischemic attack occurred in 66 (0.8%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 46 (0.5%) randomized to PCI alone (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-2.10; P=0.06). There were no significant differences in recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, heart failure, or target vessel revascularization. In the subgroup with high thrombus burden (TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction] thrombus grade >/=3), thrombus aspiration was associated with fewer cardiovascular deaths (170 [2.5%] versus 205 [3.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.98; P=0.03) and with more strokes or transient ischemic attacks (55 [0.9%] versus 34 [0.5%]; odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.42, P=0.04). However, the interaction P values were 0.32 and 0.34, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Routine thrombus aspiration during PCI for ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction did not improve clinical outcomes. In the high thrombus burden group, the trends toward reduced cardiovascular death and increased stroke or transient ischemic attack provide a rationale for future trials of improved thrombus aspiration technologies in this high-risk subgroup.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify those characteristics of self-management interventions in patients with heart failure (HF) that are effective in influencing health-related quality of life, mortality, and hospitalizations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Randomized trials on self-management interventions conducted between January 1985 and June 2013 were identified and individual patient data were requested for meta-analysis. Generalized mixed effects models and Cox proportional hazard models including frailty terms were used to assess the relation between characteristics of interventions and health-related outcomes. Twenty randomized trials (5624 patients) were included. Longer intervention duration reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-0.999 per month increase in duration), risk of HF-related hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-0.99), and HF-related hospitalization at 6 months (risk ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.995). Although results were not consistent across outcomes, interventions comprising standardized training of interventionists, peer contact, log keeping, or goal-setting skills appeared less effective than interventions without these characteristics. CONCLUSION: No specific program characteristics were consistently associated with better effects of self-management interventions, but longer duration seemed to improve the effect of self-management interventions on several outcomes. Future research using factorial trial designs and process evaluations is needed to understand the working mechanism of specific program characteristics of self-management interventions in HF patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management interventions are widely implemented in the care for patients with heart failure (HF). However, trials show inconsistent results, and whether specific patient groups respond differently is unknown. This individual patient data meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of self-management interventions in patients with HF and whether subgroups of patients respond differently. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic literature search identified randomized trials of self-management interventions. Data from 20 studies, representing 5624 patients, were included and analyzed with the use of mixed-effects models and Cox proportional-hazard models, including interaction terms. Self-management interventions reduced the risk of time to the combined end point of HF-related hospitalization or all-cause death (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.89), time to HF-related hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92), and improved 12-month HF-related quality of life (standardized mean difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00-0.30). Subgroup analysis revealed a protective effect of self-management on the number of HF-related hospital days in patients <65 years of age (mean, 0.70 versus 5.35 days; interaction P=0.03). Patients without depression did not show an effect of self-management on survival (hazard ratio for all-cause mortality, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.69-1.06), whereas in patients with moderate/severe depression, self-management reduced survival (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06-1.83, interaction P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that self-management interventions had a beneficial effect on time to HF-related hospitalization or all-cause death and HF-related hospitalization alone and elicited a small increase in HF-related quality of life. The findings do not endorse limiting self-management interventions to subgroups of patients with HF, but increased mortality in depressed patients warrants caution in applying self-management strategies in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management interventions are considered effective in patients with COPD, but trials have shown inconsistent results and it is unknown which patients benefit most. This study aimed to summarize the evidence on effectiveness of self-management interventions and identify subgroups of COPD patients who benefit most. METHODS: Randomized trials of self-management interventions between 1985 and 2013 were identified through a systematic literature search. Individual patient data of selected studies were requested from principal investigators and analyzed in an individual patient data meta-analysis using generalized mixed effects models. RESULTS: Fourteen trials representing 3,282 patients were included. Self-management interventions improved health-related quality of life at 12 months (standardized mean difference 0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.00-0.16) and time to first respiratory-related hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.94) and all-cause hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.90), but had no effect on mortality. Prespecified subgroup analyses showed that interventions were more effective in males (6-month COPD-related hospitalization: interaction P=0.006), patients with severe lung function (6-month all-cause hospitalization: interaction P=0.016), moderate self-efficacy (12-month COPD-related hospitalization: interaction P=0.036), and high body mass index (6-month COPD-related hospitalization: interaction P=0.028 and 6-month mortality: interaction P=0.026). In none of these subgroups, a consistent effect was shown on all relevant outcomes. CONCLUSION: Self-management interventions exert positive effects in patients with COPD on respiratory-related and all-cause hospitalizations and modest effects on 12-month health-related quality of life, supporting the implementation of self-management strategies in clinical practice. Benefits seem similar across the subgroups studied and limiting self-management interventions to specific patient subgroups cannot be recommended.

AB  - Background: Understanding factors associated with high placebo responses in clinical trials increases the likelihood of detecting a meaningful treatment effect. The aim of the present study was to identify subject-level factors that contribute to placebo variability in patients with neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods: Multiple regression analysis of patient data from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (duration >4 weeks) involving individuals with SCI was performed. Patient demographics, as well as injury and pain characteristics were examined for their association with changes in pain rating from baseline to the end of the trial (i.e., placebo response). The overall effect of individual predictors was quantified with meta-analysis statistics. Results: A total of 276 patients with SCI from six studies were included in the analysis. Based on the meta-analysis of subject-level predictors, larger placebo responses were associated with male subjects (beta=0.635; standard error [SE]=0.262; p=0.016) and higher baseline pain (beta=-0.146; SE=0.073; p=0.044). There were no significant effects for injury characteristics (i.e., severity, level, and time since injury) or pain characteristics (i.e., location and evoked). No significant publication bias was detected. Conclusion: The current meta-analysis of individual patient data demonstrated the importance of sex and baseline pain intensity on changes in pain ratings in the placebo arm of SCI central neuropathic pain randomized controlled clinical trials. Overall, our findings indicate that placebo responses occur independent of injury characteristics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of psychosocial interventions (PSI) on quality of life (QoL), emotional function (EF), and social function (SF) in patients with cancer, and to study moderator effects of demographic, clinical, personal, and intervention-related characteristics. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified via literature searches in 4 databases. We pooled IPD from 22 (n = 4217) of 61 eligible randomized controlled trials. Linear mixed-effect model analyses were used to study intervention effects on the post-intervention values of QoL, EF, and SF (z-scores), adjusting for baseline values, age, and cancer type. We studied moderator effects by testing interactions with the intervention for demographic, clinical, personal, and intervention-related characteristics, and conducted subsequent stratified analyses for significant moderator variables. RESULTS: PSI significantly improved QoL (beta = 0.14,95%CI = 0.06;0.21), EF (beta = 0.13,95%CI = 0.05;0.20), and SF (beta = 0.10,95%CI = 0.03;0.18). Significant differences in effects of different types of PSI were found, with largest effects of psychotherapy. The effects of coping skills training were moderated by age, treatment type, and targeted interventions. Effects of psychotherapy on EF may be moderated by cancer type, but these analyses were based on 2 randomized controlled trials with small sample sizes of some cancer types. CONCLUSIONS: PSI significantly improved QoL, EF, and SF, with small overall effects. However, the effects differed by several demographic, clinical, personal, and intervention-related characteristics. Our study highlights the beneficial effects of coping skills training in patients treated with chemotherapy, the importance of targeted interventions, and the need of developing interventions tailored to the specific needs of elderly patients.

AB  - Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, defined by the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel as a TG level of 177 to 885 mg/dl (2.0 to 10.0 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction remains the primary treatment goal. Using data from the indiVidual patient meta-analysis Of statin therapY in At risk Groups: Effects of Rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin (VOYAGER) meta-analysis, we analyzed LDL-C and TG reductions in patients with baseline TG >/=177 mg/dl (>/=2.0 mmol/L). Least squares mean percentage change from baseline in LDL-C and TG was compared using 15,800 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 5 to 40 mg, atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, and simvastatin 10 to 80 mg in patients with baseline TG >/=177 mg/dl (>/=2.0 mmol/L). Comparisons were made using mixed-effects models with data only from studies directly comparing treatments by randomized design. Mean LDL-C reductions ranged from -26.9% to -55.5%. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater LDL-C reductions than equal or double doses of atorvastatin and simvastatin (p <0.05). Mean TG reductions ranged from -15.1% to -31.3%. Rosuvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than atorvastatin 10 mg (p <0.05). Rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg resulted in TG reductions similar to those with equal doses of atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than equal or double doses of simvastatin (p <0.05). In conclusion, in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C reduction was substantial and dependent on the choice and dose of statin. TG reduction was numerically less than for LDL-C, and additional TG-lowering therapy may be considered to further reduce residual cardiovascular risk.

AB  - AIMS: Patient response to statin treatment is individual and varied. As a consequence, when using a specific-dose approach, as recommended in the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline, there will be a range of reductions in the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The aim of this study was to use individual patient data from the VOYAGER meta-analysis to determine the extent of the variability in LDL-C reduction in response to treatment across the recommended doses of different statins. METHODS AND RESULTS: The percentage change from baseline in LDL-C was calculated using individual subject data collected from 32 258 patients treated with atorvastatin 10-80 mg, rosuvastatin 5-40 mg, or simvastatin 10-80 mg. The percentage change in LDL-C for each patient was then used to generate waterfall plots that demonstrated the extent of the variability in response to treatment at all doses of the three statins. The standard deviation of LDL-C reduction for all statins and doses ranged from 12.8 to 17.9%. The percentage of patients experiencing a suboptimal response (<30% reduction in LDL-C) ranged from 5.3 to 53.3%. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that there is considerable individual variation in the LDL-C reduction at all doses of simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines have traditionally recommended blood pressure treatment based primarily on blood pressure thresholds. In contrast, using predicted cardiovascular risk has been advocated as a more effective strategy to guide treatment decisions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. We aimed to compare outcomes from a blood pressure-lowering treatment strategy based on predicted cardiovascular risk with one based on systolic blood pressure (SBP) level. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used individual participant data from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (BPLTTC) from 1995 to 2013. Trials randomly assigned participants to either blood pressure-lowering drugs versus placebo or more intensive versus less intensive blood pressure-lowering regimens. We estimated 5-y risk of CVD events using a multivariable Weibull model previously developed in this dataset. We compared the two strategies at specific SBP thresholds and across the spectrum of risk and blood pressure levels studied in BPLTTC trials. The primary outcome was number of CVD events avoided per persons treated. We included data from 11 trials (47,872 participants). During a median of 4.0 y of follow-up, 3,566 participants (7.5%) experienced a major cardiovascular event. Areas under the curve comparing the two treatment strategies throughout the range of possible thresholds for CVD risk and SBP demonstrated that, on average, a greater number of CVD events would be avoided for a given number of persons treated with the CVD risk strategy compared with the SBP strategy (area under the curve 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.72] for the CVD risk strategy versus 0.54 [95% CI 0.53-0.55] for the SBP strategy). Compared with treating everyone with SBP >/= 150 mmHg, a CVD risk strategy would require treatment of 29% (95% CI 26%-31%) fewer persons to prevent the same number of events or would prevent 16% (95% CI 14%-18%) more events for the same number of persons treated. Compared with treating everyone with SBP >/= 140 mmHg, a CVD risk strategy would require treatment of 3.8% (95% CI 12.5% fewer to 7.2% more) fewer persons to prevent the same number of events or would prevent 3.1% (95% CI 1.5%-5.0%) more events for the same number of persons treated, although the former estimate was not statistically significant. In subgroup analyses, the CVD risk strategy did not appear to be more beneficial than the SBP strategy in patients with diabetes mellitus or established CVD. CONCLUSIONS: A blood pressure-lowering treatment strategy based on predicted cardiovascular risk is more effective than one based on blood pressure levels alone across a range of thresholds. These results support using cardiovascular risk assessment to guide blood pressure treatment decision-making in moderate- to high-risk individuals, particularly for primary prevention.

AB  - Little is known about clinically relevant changes in guided Internet-based interventions for depression. Moreover, methodological and power limitations preclude the identification of patients' groups that may benefit more from these interventions. This study aimed to investigate response rates, remission rates, and their moderators in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of guided Internet-based interventions for adult depression to control groups using an individual patient data meta-analysis approach. Literature searches in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library resulted in 13,384 abstracts from database inception to January 1, 2016. Twenty-four RCTs (4889 participants) comparing a guided Internet-based intervention with a control group contributed data to the analysis. Missing data were multiply imputed. To examine treatment outcome on response and remission, mixed-effects models with participants nested within studies were used. Response and remission rates were calculated using the Reliable Change Index. The intervention group obtained significantly higher response rates (OR=2.49, 95% CI 2.17-2.85) and remission rates compared to controls (OR=2.41, 95% CI 2.07-2.79). The moderator analysis indicated that older participants (OR=1.01) and native-born participants (1.66) were more likely to respond to treatment compared to younger participants and ethnic minorities respectively. Age (OR=1.01) and ethnicity (1.73) also moderated the effects of treatment on remission.Moreover, adults with more severe depressive symptoms at baseline were more likely to remit after receiving internet-based treatment (OR=1.19). Guided Internet-based interventions lead to substantial positive treatment effects on treatment response and remission at post-treatment. Thus, such interventions may complement existing services for depression and potentially reduce the gap between the need and provision of evidence-based treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that web-based interventions can be effective treatments for depression. However, dropout rates in web-based interventions are typically high, especially in self-guided web-based interventions. Rigorous empirical evidence regarding factors influencing dropout in self-guided web-based interventions is lacking due to small study sample sizes. In this paper we examined predictors of dropout in an individual patient data meta-analysis to gain a better understanding of who may benefit from these interventions. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychotherapy for adults with depression from 2006 to January 2013 was conducted. Next, we approached authors to collect the primary data of the selected studies. Predictors of dropout, such as socio-demographic, clinical, and intervention characteristics were examined. RESULTS: Data from 2705 participants across ten RCTs of self-guided web-based interventions for depression were analysed. The multivariate analysis indicated that male gender [relative risk (RR) 1.08], lower educational level (primary education, RR 1.26) and co-morbid anxiety symptoms (RR 1.18) significantly increased the risk of dropping out, while for every additional 4 years of age, the risk of dropping out significantly decreased (RR 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Dropout can be predicted by several variables and is not randomly distributed. This knowledge may inform tailoring of online self-help interventions to prevent dropout in identified groups at risk.

AB  - Importance: Self-guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has the potential to increase access and availability of evidence-based therapy and reduce the cost of depression treatment. Objectives: To estimate the effect of self-guided iCBT in treating adults with depressive symptoms compared with controls and evaluate the moderating effects of treatment outcome and response. Data Sources: A total of 13384 abstracts were retrieved through a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library from database inception to January 1, 2016. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials in which self-guided iCBT was compared with a control (usual care, waiting list, or attention control) in individuals with symptoms of depression. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Primary authors provided individual participant data from 3876 participants from 13 of 16 eligible studies. Missing data were handled using multiple imputations. Mixed-effects models with participants nested within studies were used to examine treatment outcomes and moderators. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores. Scales were standardized across the pool of the included studies. Results: Of the 3876 study participants, the mean (SD) age was 42.0 (11.7) years, 2531 (66.0%) of 3832 were female, 1368 (53.1%) of 2574 completed secondary education, and 2262 (71.9%) of 3146 were employed. Self-guided iCBT was significantly more effective than controls on depressive symptoms severity (beta = -0.21; Hedges g = 0.27) and treatment response (beta = 0.53; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.52-2.50; number needed to treat, 8). Adherence to treatment was associated with lower depressive symptoms (beta = -0.19; P = .001) and greater response to treatment (beta = 0.90; P < .001). None of the examined participant and study-level variables moderated treatment outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: Self-guided iCBT is effective in treating depressive symptoms. The use of meta-analyses of individual participant data provides substantial evidence for clinical and policy decision making because self-guided iCBT can be considered as an evidence-based first-step approach in treating symptoms of depression. Several limitations of the iCBT should be addressed before it can be disseminated into routine care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of laparoscopy for major hepatectomies remains a matter of development to be further assessed. The purpose of this study is to compare the short- and long-term outcomes between laparoscopic and open major hepatectomies meta-analyzing individual patient data from published comparative studies. METHODS: All retrospective studies comparing between laparoscopic and open major hepatectomies published until March 2017 were identified independently by 2 reviewers by searching in PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Individual patient data were sought from all selected studies. Postoperative outcomes, including intraoperative blood loss, operative time, hospital stay, postoperative complications, mortality rates, and long-term survival were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 917 patients were divided into the laparoscopic (427) and open (490) groups from 8 selected studies. The hospital stay was significantly shorter, and the total morbidity was lower in the laparoscopic group. When classified by severity, the incidence of postoperative minor complications was lower; however, that of major complications was not significantly different. The operative time was longer in the laparoscopic group; however, intraoperative blood loss, perioperative mortality, and blood transfusions were comparable between the 2 groups. The overall survival in the patients with colorectal liver metastases and hepatocellular carcinoma was not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic major hepatectomies offer some perioperative advantages, including fewer complications and shorter hospital stay, without increasing the blood loss volume and mortality. Whether these results can anticipate the outcomes in future randomized controlled trials has not been determined.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Qutenza is a high-dose capsaicin patch used to relieve neuropathic pain from postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and HIV-associated neuropathy (HIV-AN). In clinical studies, some patients had a dramatic response to the capsaicin patch. Our objective was to determine the baseline characteristics of patients who best benefit from capsaicin patch treatment. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of 6 completed randomized and controlled Qutenza studies by pooling individual patient data. Sustained response was defined as>50% decrease in the mean pain intensity from baseline to weeks 2 to 12, and Complete Response as an average pain intensity score</=1 during weeks 2 to 12. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of response and Complete Response, and subgroups of patients who respond best to the capsaicin patch. RESULTS: Baseline pain intensity score (BPIS)</=4 was a predictor of Sustained and Complete Response in PHN and HIV-AN patients; absence of allodynia and presence of hypoesthesia, and a McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) sensory score <22 were predictors of Sustained Response in PHN patients; female sex was a predictor of Sustained and Complete Response in HIV-AN patients. Thus, characteristics associated with the highest chance of responding to the capsaicin patch were, for PHN, BPIS</=4, MPQ sensory score</=22, absence of allodynia, and presence of hypoesthesia; for HIV-AN, they were female sex and BPIS</=4. Patients with these characteristics had a statistically significantly greater chance of responding to the capsaicin patch than other patients. DISCUSSION: We identified subpopulations of PHN and HIV-AN patients likely to benefit from the capsaicin patch.

AB  - In order to evaluate the favorable effect of whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) on low back pain (LBP), an aspect which is frequently claimed by commercial providers, we performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data. The analysis is based on five of our recently conducted randomized controlled WB-EMS trials with adults 60 years+, all of which applied similar WB-EMS protocols (1.5 sessions/week, bipolar current, 16-25 min/session, 85 Hz, 350 mus, and 4-6 s impulse/4 s impulse-break) and used the same pain questionnaire. From these underlying trials, we included only subjects with frequent-chronic LBP in the present meta-analysis. Study endpoints were pain intensity and frequency at the lumbar spine. In summary, 23 participants of the underlying WB-EMS and 22 subjects of the control groups (CG) were pooled in a joint WB-EMS and CG. At baseline, no group differences with respect to LBP intensity and frequency were observed. Pain intensity improved significantly in the WB-EMS (p < .001) and was maintained (p = .997) in the CG. LBP frequency decreased significantly in the WB-EMS (p < .001) and improved nonsignificantly in the CG (p = .057). Group differences for both LBP parameters were significant (p </= .035). We concluded that WB-EMS appears to be an effective training tool for reducing LBP; however, RCTs should further address this issue with more specified study protocols.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The comparative effectiveness of percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone for cryptogenic stroke is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: The authors performed the first pooled analysis of individual participant data from completed randomized trials comparing PFO closure versus medical therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke. METHODS: The analysis included data on 2 devices (STARFlex [umbrella occluder] [NMT Medical, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts] and Amplatzer PFO Occluder [disc occluder] [AGA Medical/St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota]) evaluated in 3 trials. The primary composite outcome was stroke, transient ischemic attack, or death; the secondary outcome was stroke. We used log-rank tests and unadjusted and covariate-adjusted Cox regression models to compare device closure versus medical therapy. RESULTS: Among 2,303 patients, closure was not significantly associated with the primary composite outcome. The difference became significant after covariate adjustment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.68; p = 0.049). For the outcome of stroke, all comparisons were statistically significant, with unadjusted and adjusted HRs of 0.58 (p = 0.043) and 0.58 (p = 0.044), respectively. In analyses limited to the 2 disc occluder device trials, the effect of closure was not significant for the composite outcome, but was for the stroke outcome (unadjusted HR: 0.39; p = 0.013). Subgroup analyses did not identify significant heterogeneity of treatment effects. Atrial fibrillation was more common among closure patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke, closure reduced recurrent stroke and had a statistically significant effect on the composite of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and death in adjusted but not unadjusted analyses.

AB  - AIMS: The preferred antithrombotic strategy for secondary prevention in patients with cryptogenic stroke (CS) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) is unknown. We pooled multiple observational studies and used propensity score-based methods to estimate the comparative effectiveness of oral anticoagulation (OAC) compared with antiplatelet therapy (APT). METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual participant data from 12 databases of medically treated patients with CS and PFO were analysed with Cox regression models, to estimate database-specific hazard ratios (HRs) comparing OAC with APT, for both the primary composite outcome [recurrent stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), or death] and stroke alone. Propensity scores were applied via inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for confounding. We synthesized database-specific HRs using random-effects meta-analysis models. This analysis included 2385 (OAC = 804 and APT = 1581) patients with 227 composite endpoints (stroke/TIA/death). The difference between OAC and APT was not statistically significant for the primary composite outcome [adjusted HR = 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52-1.12] or for the secondary outcome of stroke alone (adjusted HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.44-1.27). Results were consistent in analyses applying alternative weighting schemes, with the exception that OAC had a statistically significant beneficial effect on the composite outcome in analyses standardized to the patient population who actually received APT (adjusted HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.99). Subgroup analyses did not detect statistically significant heterogeneity of treatment effects across clinically important patient groups. CONCLUSION: We did not find a statistically significant difference comparing OAC with APT; our results justify randomized trials comparing different antithrombotic approaches in these patients.

AB  - In a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 5 randomized controlled trials, endovascular treatment (EVT) mainly using a stent retriever achieved successful recanalization in 71.1% of patients suffering from acute stroke due to anterior circulation large artery occlusion (LAO). However, EVT still failed in 28.9% of LAO cases in those 5 successful trials. Stent retriever failure may occur due to anatomical challenges (e.g., a tortuous arterial tree from the aortic arch to a target occlusion site), a large quantity of clots, tandem occlusion, clot characteristics (fresh versus organized clots), different pathomechanisms (embolic versus non-embolic occlusion), etc. Given that recanalization success is the most important factor in the neurological outcome of acute stroke patients, it is important to seek solutions for such difficult cases. In this review, the basic technique of EVT is briefly summarized and then various difficult cases with diverse conditions are discussed along with suggested solutions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of local failure (LF) after treatment of high-grade prostate cancer (PCa) with definitive radiotherapy (RT) remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical implications of LF after definitive RT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Individual patient data meta-analysis of 992 patients (593 Gleason grade group [GG] 4 and 399 GG 5) enrolled in six randomized clinical trials. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were developed to evaluate the relationship between overall survival (OS), PCa-specific survival (PCSS), and distant metastasis (DM)-free survival (DMFS) and LF as a time-dependent covariate. Markov proportional hazard models were developed to evaluate the impact of specific transitions between disease states on these endpoints. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Median follow-up was 6.4yr overall and 7.2yr for surviving patients. LF was significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.70 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.37-2.10]), PCSS (3.10 [95% CI 2.33-4.12]), and DMFS (HR 1.92 [95% CI 1.54-2.39]), p<0.001 for all). Patients who had not transitioned to the LF state had a significantly lower hazard of transitioning to a PCa-specific death state than those who transitioned to the LF state (HR 0.13 [95% CI 0.04-0.41], p<0.001). Additionally, patients who transitioned to the LF state had a greater hazard of DM or death (HR 2.46 [95% CI 1.22-4.93], p=0.01) than those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: LF is an independent prognosticator of OS, PCSS, and DMFS in high-grade localized PCa and a subset of DM events that are anteceded by LF events. LF events warrant consideration for intervention, potentially suggesting a rationale for upfront treatment intensification. However, whether these findings apply to all men or just those without significant comorbidity remains to be determined. PATIENT SUMMARY: Men who experience a local recurrence of high-grade prostate cancer after receiving upfront radiation therapy are at significantly increased risks of developing metastases and dying of prostate cancer.

AB  - Importance: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves survival outcomes in patients with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) treated with radiotherapy (RT). Whether this benefit differs between patients with Gleason grade group (GG) 4 (formerly Gleason score 8) and GG 5 (formerly Gleason score 9-10) disease remains unknown. Objective: To determine whether the effectiveness of ADT duration varies between patients with GG 4 vs GG 5 PCa. Design, Setting, and Participants: Traditional and network individual patient data meta-analyses of 992 patients (593 GG 4 and 399 GG 5) who were enrolled in 6 randomized clinical trials were carried out. Main Outcomes and Measures: Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to obtain hazard ratio (HR) estimates of ADT duration effects on overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Cause-specific competing risk models were used to estimate HRs for cancer-specific survival (CSS). The interaction of ADT with GS was incorporated into the multivariable models. Traditional and network meta-analysis frameworks were used to compare outcomes of patients treated with RT alone, short-term ADT (STADT), long-term ADT (LTADT), and lifelong ADT. Results: Five hundred ninety-three male patients (mean age, 70 years; range, 43-88 years) with GG 4 and 399 with GG 5 were identified. Median follow-up was 6.4 years. Among GG 4 patients, LTADT and STADT improved OS over RT alone (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26-0.70 and HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.93, respectively; P = .03 for both), whereas lifelong ADT did not (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.54-1.30; P = .44). Among GG 5 patients, lifelong ADT improved OS (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.76; P = .04), whereas neither LTADT nor STADT did (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.45-1.44 and HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.69-1.87; P = .45 and P = .64, respectively). Among all patients, and among those receiving STADT, GG 5 patients had inferior OS compared with GG 4 patients (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.07-1.47 and HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05-1.88, respectively; P = .02). There was no significant OS difference between GG 5 and GG 4 patients receiving LTADT or lifelong ADT (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.89-1.65 and HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.53-1.37; P = .23 and P = .52, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: These data suggest that prolonged durations of ADT improve survival outcomes in both GG 4 disease and GG 5 disease, albeit with different optimal durations. Strategies to maintain the efficacy of ADT while minimizing its duration (potentially with enhanced potency agents) should be investigated.

AB  - Aim: Studies have reported less favourable outcomes in women compared with men after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Whether sex-specific differences in the magnitude or prognostic impact of infarct size or post-infarction cardiac function explain this finding is unknown. Methods and results: We pooled patient-level data from 10 randomized primary PCI trials in which infarct size was measured within 1 month (median 4 days) by either cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography. We assessed the association between sex, infarct size, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the composite rate of death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization within 1 year. Of 2632 patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI, 587 (22.3%) were women. Women were older than men and had a longer delay between symptom onset and reperfusion. Infarct size did not significantly differ between women and men, and women had higher LVEF. Nonetheless, women had a higher 1-year rate of death or HF hospitalization compared to men, and while infarct size was a strong independent predictor of 1-year death or HF hospitalization (P < 0.0001), no interaction was present between sex and infarct size or LVEF on the risk of death or HF hospitalization. Conclusions: In this large-scale, individual patient-level pooled analysis of patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI, women had a higher 1-year rate of death or HF hospitalization compared to men, a finding not explained by sex-specific differences in the magnitude or prognostic impact of infarct size or by differences in post-infarction cardiac function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between mortality and heart rate remains unclear for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in either sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVES: This analysis explored the prognostic importance of heart rate in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in randomized controlled trials comparing beta-blockers and placebo. METHODS: The Beta-Blockers in Heart Failure Collaborative Group performed a meta-analysis of harmonized individual patient data from 11 double-blind randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, analyzed with Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) modeling heart rate measured at baseline and approximately 6 months post-randomization. RESULTS: A higher heart rate at baseline was associated with greater all-cause mortality for patients in sinus rhythm (n = 14,166; adjusted HR: 1.11 per 10 beats/min; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 1.15; p < 0.0001) but not in AF (n = 3,034; HR: 1.03 per 10 beats/min; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.08; p = 0.38). Beta-blockers reduced ventricular rate by 12 beats/min in both sinus rhythm and AF. Mortality was lower for patients in sinus rhythm randomized to beta-blockers (HR: 0.73 vs. placebo; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.79; p < 0.001), regardless of baseline heart rate (interaction p = 0.35). Beta-blockers had no effect on mortality in patients with AF (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.12; p = 0.58) at any heart rate (interaction p = 0.48). A lower achieved resting heart rate, irrespective of treatment, was associated with better prognosis only for patients in sinus rhythm (HR: 1.16 per 10 beats/min increase, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.22; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of pre-treatment heart rate, beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in sinus rhythm. Achieving a lower heart rate is associated with better prognosis, but only for those in sinus rhythm.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of beta blockers in a broad age range of women and men with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) by pooling individual patient data from placebo controlled randomised trials. DESIGN: Prospectively designed meta-analysis of individual patient data from patients aged 40-85 in sinus rhythm at baseline, with left ventricular ejection fraction <0.45. PARTICIPANTS: 13,833 patients from 11 trials; median age 64; 24% women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was all cause mortality; the major secondary outcome was admission to hospital for heart failure. Analysis was by intention to treat with an adjusted one stage Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, beta blockers were effective in reducing mortality across all ages: hazard ratios were 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.83) for the first quarter of age distribution (median age 50); 0.71 (0.58 to 0.87) for the second quarter (median age 60); 0.65 (0.53 to 0.78) for the third quarter (median age 68); and 0.77 (0.64 to 0.92) for the fourth quarter (median age 75). There was no significant interaction when age was modelled continuously (P=0.1), and the absolute reduction in mortality was 4.3% over a median follow-up of 1.3 years (number needed to treat 23). Admission to hospital for heart failure was significantly reduced by beta blockers, although this effect was attenuated at older ages (interaction P=0.05). There was no evidence of an interaction between treatment effect and sex in any age group. Drug discontinuation was similar regardless of treatment allocation, age, or sex (14.4% in those give beta blockers, 15.6% in those receiving placebo). CONCLUSION: Irrespective of age or sex, patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm should receive beta blockers to reduce the risk of death and admission to hospital.Registration PROSPERO CRD42014010012; Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00832442.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Relapse prevention in recurrent depression is a significant public health problem, and antidepressants are the current first-line treatment approach. Identifying an equally efficacious nonpharmacological intervention would be an important development. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis on individual patient data to examine the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) compared with usual care and other active treatments, including antidepressants, in treating those with recurrent depression. DATA SOURCES: English-language studies published or accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals identified from EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from the first available year to November 22, 2014. Searches were conducted from November 2010 to November 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials of manualized MBCT for relapse prevention in recurrent depression in full or partial remission that compared MBCT with at least 1 non-MBCT treatment, including usual care. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: This was an update to a previous meta-analysis. We screened 2555 new records after removing duplicates. Abstracts were screened for full-text extraction (S.S.) and checked by another researcher (T.D.). There were no disagreements. Of the original 2555 studies, 766 were evaluated against full study inclusion criteria, and we acquired full text for 8. Of these, 4 studies were excluded, and the remaining 4 were combined with the 6 studies identified from the previous meta-analysis, yielding 10 studies for qualitative synthesis. Full patient data were not available for 1 of these studies, resulting in 9 studies with individual patient data, which were included in the quantitative synthesis. RESULTS: Of the 1258 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 47.1 (11.9) years, and 944 (75.0%) were female. A 2-stage random effects approach showed that patients receiving MBCT had a reduced risk of depressive relapse within a 60-week follow-up period compared with those who did not receive MBCT (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58-0.82). Furthermore, comparisons with active treatments suggest a reduced risk of depressive relapse within a 60-week follow-up period (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.97). Using a 1-stage approach, sociodemographic (ie, age, sex, education, and relationship status) and psychiatric (ie, age at onset and number of previous episodes of depression) variables showed no statistically significant interaction with MBCT treatment. However, there was some evidence to suggest that a greater severity of depressive symptoms prior to treatment was associated with a larger effect of MBCT compared with other treatments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy appears efficacious as a treatment for relapse prevention for those with recurrent depression, particularly those with more pronounced residual symptoms. Recommendations are made concerning how future trials can address remaining uncertainties and improve the rigor of the field.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No evidence exists to recommend a specific chemotherapy regimen in young breast cancer patients. We performed a pooled analysis of two randomised clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients and its impact on the risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the MIG1 study, node-positive or high-risk node-negative patients were randomised to 6 cycles of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 (dose-dense) or 3 (standard-interval) weeks. In the GIM2 study, node-positive patients were randomised to 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval EC or FEC followed by 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval paclitaxel. Using individual patient data, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival by means of a Cox proportional hazards model and the odds ratio for treatment-induced amenorrhoea through a logistic regression model were calculated for each study. A meta-analysis of the two studies was performed using the random effect model to compute the parameter estimates. RESULTS: A total of 1,549 patients were included. Dose-dense chemotherapy was associated with a significant improved overall survival as compared to standard-interval chemotherapy (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.54-0.95; p = 0.021). The pooled HRs were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.12) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.06) for patients with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumours, respectively (interaction p = 0.330). No increased risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea was observed with dose-dense chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.25; p = 0.989). CONCLUSION: Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered the preferred treatment option in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients.

AB  - Purpose The role of temporary ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) during chemotherapy as a strategy to preserve ovarian function and fertility in premenopausal women remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis using individual patient-level data was conducted to better assess the efficacy and safety of this strategy in patients with early breast cancer. Methods The trials in which premenopausal women with early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy alone or with concurrent GnRHa were eligible for inclusion. Primary end points were premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) rate and post-treatment pregnancy rate. Disease-free survival and overall survival were secondary end points. Because each study represents a cluster, statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Results A total of 873 patients from five trials were included. POI rate was 14.1% in the GnRHa group and 30.9% in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.57; P < .001). A total of 37 (10.3%) patients had at least one post-treatment pregnancy in the GnRHa group and 20 (5.5%) in the control group (incidence rate ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.06 to 3.15; P = .030). No significant differences in disease-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.42; P = .999) and overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.06; P = .083) were observed between groups. Conclusion Our findings provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of temporary ovarian suppression with GnRHa during chemotherapy as an available option to reduce the likelihood of chemotherapy-induced POI and potentially improve future fertility in premenopausal patients with early breast cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: Guidelines for shock recommend mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets for vasopressor therapy of at least 65 mmHg and, until recently, suggested that patients with underlying chronic hypertension and atherosclerosis may benefit from higher targets. We conducted an individual patient-data meta-analysis of recent trials to determine if patient variables modify the effect of different MAP targets. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomized controlled trials of higher versus lower blood pressure targets for vasopressor therapy in adult patients in shock (until November 2017). After obtaining individual patient data from both eligible trials, we used a modified version of the Cochrane Collaboration's instrument to assess the risk of bias of included trials. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Included trials enrolled 894 patients. Controlling for trial and site, the OR for 28-day mortality for the higher versus lower MAP targets was 1.15 (95% CI 0.87-1.52). Treatment effect varied by duration of vasopressors before randomization (interaction p = 0.017), but not by chronic hypertension, congestive heart failure or age. Risk of death increased in higher MAP groups among patients on vasopressors > 6 h before randomization (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.33-6.74). CONCLUSIONS: Targeting higher blood pressure targets may increase mortality in patients who have been treated with vasopressors for more than 6 h. Lower blood pressure targets were not associated with patient-important adverse events in any subgroup, including chronically hypertensive patients.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding a single bolus dose of insulin glulisine to basal insulin ('basal-plus') in persons with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Data from patients with poor glycemic control on oral antihyperglycemic drugs who were initiated on a 'basal-plus' regimen for up to 6 months were pooled from four randomized, multicenter studies. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose (PPG), insulin dose and demographics were measured at baseline and end of study. RESULTS: 711 patients with a mean age of 59.9 years and a mean duration of diabetes of 11.0 years were included in the analysis population. A 'basal-plus' regimen was associated with significant decreases in HbA1c and PPG at 6 months, an increase in glargine and glulisine doses and small, but statistically significant, changes in body weight and BMI in all patient subsets. The proportion of patients with HbA1c<7% also increased in all populations studied, while the prevalence of severe hypoglycemia was low and did not significantly differ across patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of 'basal-plus' can achieve a good therapeutic response with a low risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain, regardless of a patient's age or BMI.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized controlled trials of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in lumbar spinal fusion. OBJECTIVE: To determine how patient characteristics impact estimates of effectiveness and harms of rhBMP-2 versus iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) in lumbar spinal fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patient characteristics are thought to impact rates of fusion in spinal fusion surgery, but no analyses examining the effect of patient characteristics on efficacy and safety of rhBMP-2 as compared with ICBG have been conducted. METHODS: Using individual patient data obtained from the Yale Open Data Access Project, the impact of patient characteristics on the effects of rhBMP-2 on fusion, overall success, and harms were assessed using linear and generalized linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: Ten industry-sponsored randomized controlled trials of rhBMP-2 were included in the analysis. There is preliminary support for an association between rhBMP-2 and improved outcomes for smokers (P = 0.01), individuals under the age of 60 years (P < 0.01), and patients of normal weight (P = 0.03), but not in patients who are nonsmokers, over the age of 60 years, obese or severely obese. RhBMP-2 usage was associated with decreased harms in individuals with no previous back surgeries but this was not seen in individuals with a previous back surgery (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Effects of rhBMP-2 may vary according to patient characteristics. Future studies of rhBMP-2 should include planned subgroup analysis in patients over 60 years, smokers, patients that are obese and severely obese, and individuals with previous back surgeries to better identify those most likely to benefit.

AB  - Background: We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis to examine the impact of first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy on overall survival (OS) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Data from trials comparing EGFR-TKI against chemotherapy in exon 19 deletion (del19) or exon 21 L858R (L858R) EGFR mutations patients were used. We performed Cox regression to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Impact of postprogression therapies was examined in exploratory analyses. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Six eligible trials (gefitinib = 3, erlotinib = 3) included 1231 patients; 632 received EGFR-TKI and 599 received chemotherapy. At a median 35.0 months follow-up, there were 780 deaths and 1004 progressions. There was no difference in OS between EGFR-TKI and chemotherapy (HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.17, P = .84). There was also no difference in OS for Del19 (n = 682, HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.16, P = .68) and L858R (n = 540, HR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.86 to 1.32, P = .59) subgroups ( P interaction = .47), or according to smoking status, sex, performance status, age, ethnicity, or histology. However, EGFR-TKI statistically significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) overall (HR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.42, P < .001) and in all subgroups. Following progression, 73.8% from the chemotherapy arm received EGFR-TKI, and 65.9% from the EGFR-TKI arm received chemotherapy. Nine percent from the EGFR-TKI arm received no further treatment vs 0.6% from the chemotherapy arm. Following disease progression, patients randomly assigned to EGFR-TKI had shorter OS than those randomly assigned to chemotherapy (12.8 months, 95% CI = 11.4 to 14.3, vs 19.8 months, 95% CI = 17.6 to 21.7). Conclusions: Despite statistically significant PFS benefit, there is no relative OS advantage with frontline gefitinib or erlotinib vs chemotherapy in EGFR -mutated NSCLC. This finding is likely due to the high rate of crossover at progression.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The authors undertook a patient-level meta-analysis to compare long-term outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) in 3,280 patients with left main or multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). BACKGROUND: The relative efficacy and safety of CABG versus PCI with DES for left main or multivessel CAD remain controversial. METHODS: Data were pooled from the BEST (Randomized Comparison of Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery and Everolimus Eluting Stent Implantation in the Treatment of Patients With Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease), PRECOMBAT (Premier of Randomized Comparison of Bypass Surgery vs. Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting Stent in Patients With Left Main Coronary Artery Disease), and SYNTAX (Synergy Between PCI With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) trials. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 60 months, and follow-up was completed for 96.2% of patients. The rate of primary outcome was significantly lower with CABG than with PCI (13.0% vs. 16.0%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69 to 1.00; p = 0.046). The difference was mainly driven by reduction in myocardial infarction (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.64; p < 0.001). There was significant interaction between treatment effect and types of CAD, showing CABG to be superior compared with PCI with DES in patients with multivessel CAD (p = 0.001), but no between-group difference in those with left main CAD (p = 0.427). The rates for all-cause death and stroke were similar between the 2 groups. By contrast, the need for repeat revascularization was significantly lower in the CABG group compared with the PCI group. CONCLUSIONS: CABG, as compared with PCI with DES, reduced long-term rates of the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in patients with left main or multivessel CAD. The advantage of CABG over PCI with DES was particularly pronounced in those with multivessel CAD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after the implantation of a drug-eluting stent (DES) in elderly patients. BACKGROUND: Qualified studies to evaluate the optimal duration of DAPT in elderly patients have been very limited. METHODS: Using 6 randomized trials that compared short-term (</=6 months) and long-term (12 months) DAPT, individual participant data meta-analysis was performed in elderly patients (>/=65 years of age). The primary study outcome was the 12-month risk of a composite of myocardial infarction, definite or probable stent thrombosis, or stroke. The major secondary outcome was the 12-month risk of major bleeding. RESULTS: The primary outcome risk did not significantly differ between patients receiving short-term and long-term DAPT (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88 to 1.43; p = 0.3581) in the overall group of study participants. In subgroup analysis, a significant interaction between age and DAPT duration was observed for primary outcome risk (p for interaction = 0.0384). In the subset of younger patients (<65 years of age, n = 6,152), short-term DAPT was associated with higher risk of primary outcome (HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.44; p = 0.0082). In elderly patients (n = 5,319), however, the risk of primary outcome did not significantly differ between patients receiving short-term and long-term DAPT (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.16; p = 0.2856). Short-term DAPT was associated with a significant reduction in major bleeding compared with long-term DAPT (HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.84; p = 0.0081) in the overall group, and particularly in elderly patients (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.24-0.88; p = 0.0196). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term DAPT after new-generation DES implantation may be more beneficial in elderly patients than in younger patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parenting programs aim to reduce children's conduct problems through improvement of family dynamics. To date, research on the precise benefits and possible harms of parenting programs on family well-being has been unsystematic and likely to be subject to selective outcome reporting and publication bias. Better understanding of program benefits and harms requires full disclosure by researchers of all included measures, and large enough numbers of participants to be able to detect small effects and estimate them precisely. METHODS: We obtained individual participant data for 14 of 15 randomized controlled trials on the Incredible Years parenting program in Europe (total N = 1,799). We used multilevel modeling to estimate program effects on 13 parent-reported outcomes, including parenting practices, children's mental health, and parental mental health. RESULTS: Parental use of praise, corporal punishment, threats, and shouting improved, while parental use of tangible rewards, monitoring, or laxness did not. Children's conduct problems and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms improved, while emotional problems did not. Parental mental health (depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and stress) did not improve. There was no evidence of harmful effects. CONCLUSIONS: The Incredible Years parenting program improves the aspects of family well-being that it is primarily designed to improve: parenting and children's conduct problems. It also improves parent-reported ADHD symptoms in children. Wider benefits are limited: the program does not improve children's emotional problems or parental mental health. There are no signs of harm on any of the target outcomes.

AB  - Children vary in the extent to which they benefit from parenting programs for conduct problems. How does parental mental health change if children benefit less or more? We assessed whether changes in conduct problems and maternal depressive symptoms co-occur following participation in the Incredible Years parenting program. We integrated individual participant data from 10 randomized trials (N = 1280; children aged 2-10 years) and distinguished latent classes based on families' baseline and post-test conduct problems and maternal depressive symptoms, using repeated measures latent class analysis (RMLCA) and latent transition analysis (LTA). Classes differed mainly in severity of conduct problems and depression (RMLCA; 4 classes). Conduct problems reduced in all classes. Depressive symptoms did not change in most classes, except in a class of families where conduct problems and depression were particularly severe. Incredible Years led to a greater likelihood of families with particularly severe conduct problems and depression moving to a class with mild problems (LTA; 3 classes). Our findings suggest that for the majority of families, children's conduct problems reduce, but maternal depressive symptoms do not, suggesting relative independence, with the exception of families with severe depression and severe conduct problems where changes for the better do co-occur.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is considerable disagreement about the risk of recurrence following a first unprovoked epileptic seizure. A decision about whether to start antiepileptic drug treatment following a first seizure should be informed by information on the size of any reduction in risk of future seizures, the impact on long-term seizure remission, and the risk of adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: To review the probability of seizure recurrence, seizure remission, mortality, and adverse effects of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment given immediately after the first seizure compared to controls, in children and adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (accessed 13 October 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library September 2015, issue 9, accessed 13 October 2015), PUBMED (accessed 22 April 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 13 October 2015), EMBASE (accessed 22 April 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (accessed 15 October 2015), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, accessed 13 October 2015). There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that could be blinded or unblinded. People of any age with a first unprovoked seizure of any type. Included studies compared participants receiving immediate antiepileptic treatment versus those receiving deferred treatment, those assigned to placebo, and those untreated. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the studies identified by the search strategy for inclusion in the review and extracted data. The quality of the evidence was classified in four categories according to the GRADE approach. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as Risk Ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Time-to-event outcomes were expressed as Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95% CI. Only one trial used a double-blind design, and the two largest studies were unblinded. Most of the recurrences were generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a major type of seizures that is easily recognised, which should reduce the risk of outcome reporting bias. MAIN RESULTS: After exclusion of uninformative papers, only six studies (nine reports) were selected for inclusion. For the two largest studies data were available for individual participant meta-analysis. Compared to controls, participants randomised to immediate treatment had a lower probability of relapse at one year (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.58, high quality evidence), at five years (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89; high quality evidence) and a higher probability of an immediate five-year remission (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.54, high quality evidence). However there was no difference between immediate treatment and control in terms of five year remission at any time (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.21, high quality evidence). Antiepileptic drugs did not affect overall mortality after a first seizure (RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.95, high quality evidence). Compared to deferred treatment (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.79, moderate quality evidence), treatment of the first seizure was associated with a significantly higher risk of adverse events. Moderate to low quality imprecise evidence was available for the association of treatment of the first seizure compared to no treatment or placebo (RR 14.50, 95% CI 1.93 to 108.76) and(RR 4.91, 95% CI 1.10 to 21.93) respectively) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of the first unprovoked seizure reduces the risk of a subsequent seizure but does not affect the proportion of patients in remission in the long-term. Antiepileptic drugs are associated with adverse events, and there is no evidence that they reduce mortality. In light of this review, the decision to start antiepileptic drug treatment following a first unprovoked seizure should be individualized and based on patient preference, clinical, legal, and socio-cultural factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) can be effective in treating chronic pain. Despite evidence supporting the effectiveness of ACT, uncertainties remain regarding which subgroups in the chronic pain population are likely to benefit most and least. This protocol describes the application for two meta-analytic approaches, one at the level of individual participant data and the other at the level of aggregated data, from randomized controlled trials of ACT for chronic pain (ACT-CP-MA). METHODS: We will systematically conduct literature searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and trial registers. Two reviewers will independently select studies for inclusion and data extraction. ACT-CP-MA will include randomized controlled trials with ACT for chronic pain compared to control conditions for adults (>/= 18 years) with chronic pain (> 3 months). We will invite the authors of all eligible trials to share individual participant data. Outcomes will include standardized measures of pain interference, pain intensity, depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life, participants' rating of overall improvement, and ACT-related process variables. Using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and GRADE, reviewers will independently check for risk of bias, quality of evidence, and strength of recommendations. In the individual participant data meta-analysis, we will use a one-step approach where participants are clustered with studies and data from all studies are modeled simultaneously. For analyses, we will use mixed-effects models. Additionally, we will employ a meta-analysis with aggregate data and compare the results of both meta-analyses. DISCUSSION: This collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomized controlled trials of ACT for chronic pain versus control conditions will demonstrate how the known benefits of ACT for chronic pain vary across different subtypes of the chronic pain population. The results of the meta-analyses will be based on a comprehensive search of multiple databases and will help to inform future clinical trials and decision-making on the use of ACT in chronic pain and improve the quality, design, and reporting of future trials in this field.

AB  - AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with symptomatic heart failure and QRS prolongation but there is uncertainty about which patient characteristics predict short-term clinical response. METHODS AND RESULTS: In an individual patient meta-analysis of three double-blind, randomized trials, clinical composite score (CCS) at 6 months was compared in patients assigned to CRT programmed on or off. Treatment-covariate interactions were assessed to measure likelihood of improved CCS at 6 months. MIRACLE, MIRACLE ICD, and REVERSE trials contributed data for this analysis (n = 1591). Multivariable modelling identified QRS duration and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as predictors of CRT clinical response (P < 0.05). The odds ratio for a better CCS at 6 months increased by 3.7% for every 1% decrease in LVEF for patients assigned to CRT-on compared to CRT-off, and was greatest when QRS duration was between 160 and 180 ms. CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic chronic heart failure patients (NYHA class II-IV), longer QRS duration and lower LVEF independently predict early clinical response to CRT.

AB  - AIMS: To explore possible associations that may explain the greater benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) reported amongst women. METHODS AND RESULTS: In an individual-patient data meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials, all-cause mortality and the composite of all-cause mortality or first hospitalization for heart failure (HF) were compared among 794 women and 2702 men assigned to CRT or a control group. Multivariable analyses were performed to assess the impact of sex, QRS duration, HF aetiology, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and height on outcome. Women were shorter, had smaller LVEDD, more often left bundle branch block, and less often ischaemic heart disease, but QRS duration was similar between sexes. Women tended to obtain greater benefit from CRT but sex was not an independent predictor of either outcome. For all-cause mortality, QRS duration was the only independent predictor of CRT benefit. For the composite outcome, height and QRS duration, but not sex, were independent predictors of CRT benefit. Further analysis suggested increasing benefit with increasing QRS duration amongst shorter patients, of whom a great proportion were women. CONCLUSIONS: In this individual-patient data meta-analysis, CRT benefit was greater in shorter patients, which may explain reports of enhanced CRT benefit among women. Further analyses are required to determine whether recommendations on the QRS threshold for CRT should be adjusted for height. (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers: NCT00170300, NCT00271154, NCT00251251).

AB  - Young women with breast cancer (BC) have a worse survival partly due to more aggressive tumor characteristics; however, their response to chemotherapy seems better. We investigated to what extent the prognostic factor pathological complete remission (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is applicable to young women. 8949 patients with primary BC and follow-up from eight German neoadjuvant trials were included. A subgroup of 1453 patients <40 years was compared with women aged 40-49 and >/=50 years regarding pCR (ypT0 ypN0), as well as disease free survival (DFS), local recurrence free survival (LRFS), distant disease free survival (DDFS), and overall survival (OS) overall, according to pCR status and subtypes defined by hormone-receptor (HR) status and HER2. pCR was strongly associated with age without a clear age cut-off. The pCR rate was significantly higher in the young compared with other age groups (20.9 vs. 17.7 vs. 13.7 %; p < 0.001). This difference was confined to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HR +/HER2-. DFS, DDFS, LRFS, and OS were significantly worse for young women. Age was independently prognostic for survival in HR +/HER2-, with women <40 years without pCR having a worse DFS compared to their counterparts with pCR. Young women are more likely to achieve pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, especially in HR +/HER2- and TNBC. Age is not an important prognostic factor in TNBC and HR-/HER2 + but is in HR +/HER2-. Young women with a luminal-like BC seem to benefit more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy than older women, which needs to be taken into account.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 randomized controlled trials comparing corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, or their combination in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. We compared the effects of the treatments on survival for 28 days or 6 months, and response to treatment based on the Lille model. METHODS: We searched PubMed for randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic therapy for severe alcoholic hepatitis. Our final analysis comprised 11 studies, of 2111 patients. We performed 4 meta-analyses of the effects of corticosteroids vs placebo or control, corticosteroids vs pentoxifylline, corticosteroids and pentoxifylline vs corticosteroids and placebo or control, and pentoxifylline vs placebo. In each meta-analysis, the effect of treatment on the primary outcome (overall survival at 28 days, defined as the period from the first day of assigned treatment to 28 days) was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model, including trials as random effect. RESULTS: Corticosteroid treatment significantly decreased risk of death within 28 days compared with controls (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48-0.86) or to pentoxifylline (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.43-0.95). In multiple-imputation and complete case analyses, the effect of corticosteroids compared with controls remained significant. When we compared corticosteroids vs pentoxifylline, the corticosteroid effect remained significant in the complete case analysis (HR 0.66; P = .04) but not in multiple-imputation analysis (HR 0.71; P = .08). There was no difference in 28-day mortality when patients were given a combination of corticosteroids and pentoxifylline vs corticosteroids alone or between patients given pentoxifylline vs control. In our analysis of secondary outcomes, we found no significant differences in 6-month mortality when any treatments or controls were compared. Corticosteroids were significantly associated with increased response to therapy compared with controls (relative risk 1.24; 95% CI 1.10-1.41) or pentoxifylline (relative risk 1.43; 95% CI 1.20-1.68). We found no difference in response to therapy between patients given a combination of corticosteroids and pentoxifylline vs corticosteroids alone or pentoxifylline vs controls. CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis of 4 controlled trials, we found corticosteroid use to reduce risk of death within 28 days of treatment, but not in the following 6 months. This loss of efficacy over time indicates a need for new therapeutic strategies to improve medium-term outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pemetrexed plus platinum has become a standard of care in first-line treatment for patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer. However, elderly lung cancer patients are generally understudied and undertreated in clinical practice in East Asia because of safety concerns. This analysis aimed to provide a picture of the clinical benefit of pemetrexed/platinum in the first-line setting for elderly (age >/= 65 years) East Asian patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient data from 3 randomized controlled phase 3 trials that enrolled East Asian patients were analyzed in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: In elderly East Asian patients (63 in the pemetrexed/platinum group and 42 in the control group), pemetrexed/platinum treatment achieved more benefits compared to other platinum-based doublets, including better overall response rate (32.8% vs. 7.5%), favorable progression-free survival (not statistically significant in adjusted hazard ratio), and significantly longer (3.15 vs. 1.54 months) survival without drug-related grade 3/4 toxicity. Overall survival was numerically prolonged (16.33 vs. 13.77 months; not statistically significant). These benefit trends were similar to those in all-age East Asian patients. In elderly East Asians, pemetrexed/platinum treatment was also associated with a lower incidence rate of drug-related grade 3/4 adverse events. The adverse event profile was similar to that in all-age East Asians. There were no unexpected adverse events. CONCLUSION: Pemetrexed/platinum had good efficacy and also resulted in better overall response and tolerability than other platinum-based doublets as first-line treatment in nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in elderly East Asians, which was consistent with data observed in all-age East Asians.

AB  - There is uncertainty regarding how long the effects of acupuncture treatment persist after a course of treatment. We aimed to determine the trajectory of pain scores over time after acupuncture, using a large individual patient data set from high-quality randomized trials of acupuncture for chronic pain. The available individual patient data set included 29 trials and 17,922 patients. The chronic pain conditions included musculoskeletal pain (low back, neck, and shoulder), osteoarthritis of the knee, and headache/migraine. We used meta-analytic techniques to determine the trajectory of posttreatment pain scores. Data on longer term follow-up were available for 20 trials, including 6376 patients. In trials comparing acupuncture to no acupuncture control (wait-list, usual care, etc), effect sizes diminished by a nonsignificant 0.011 SD per 3 months (95% confidence interval: -0.014 to 0.037, P = 0.4) after treatment ended. The central estimate suggests that approximately 90% of the benefit of acupuncture relative to controls would be sustained at 12 months. For trials comparing acupuncture to sham, we observed a reduction in effect size of 0.025 SD per 3 months (95% confidence interval: 0.000-0.050, P = 0.050), suggesting approximately a 50% diminution at 12 months. The effects of a course of acupuncture treatment for patients with chronic pain do not seem to decrease importantly over 12 months. Patients can generally be reassured that treatment effects persist. Studies of the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture should take our findings into account when considering the time horizon of acupuncture effects. Further research should measure longer term outcomes of acupuncture.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Botulinum toxin A (BTA) injection into the glabellar region is currently being studied as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Here we explore efficacy data of this novel approach in a pooled analysis. METHODS: A literature search revealed 3 RCTs on this topic. Individual patient data and clinical end points shared by these 3 trials were pooled and analyzed as one study (n=134) using multiple regression models with random effects. RESULTS: In the pooled sample, the BTA (n=59) and the placebo group (n=75) did not differ in the baseline variables. Efficacy outcomes revealed BTA superiority over placebo: Improvement in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale 6 weeks after baseline was 45.7% for BTA vs. 14.6% for placebo (p<0.0001), corresponding to a BTA response rate of 54.2% (vs. 10.7%) and a BTA remission rate of 30.5% (vs. 6.7%). DISCUSSION: Equalling the status of a meta-analysis, this study increases evidence that a single treatment of BTA into the glabellar region can reduce symptoms of MDD. Further studies are needed to better understand how BTA exerts its mood-lifting effect.

AB  - Resected stage IIB-IIIC malignant melanoma has a poor prognosis with a high risk of relapse and death. Treatment with adjuvant interferon alfa-2b (IFN-alpha-2b) is associated with improved relapse-free and overall survivals (OS), but the most appropriate dose and duration of treatment are unknown. In this article, we present an individual patient data random effects meta-analysis of melanoma patients from the U.K., Greek, and Chinese randomized trials. All patients were randomized either to IFN-alpha-2b 15-20 MIU/m(2) IV daily 5 days per week for 4 weeks (IV) or to the same regimen followed by IFN-alpha-2b 9-10 MIU/m(2) administered three times per week for 48 weeks (IV and SC). Allowing for dose interruptions and reductions, an equivalent total dose of IFN-alpha-2b was delivered in all three studies. We assessed whether IV was noninferior to IV and SC in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS) and investigated tumor and patient characteristics that impacted on outcomes. Median follow-up of 716 stage IIB-IIIC patients was 5.4 years. Noninferiority of IV compared to IV and SC could not be conferred for RFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.52; noninferior P = 0.17). Stage (P < 0.0001), site (acral vs. other, P < 0.0001), and Breslow thickness (P = 0.02) were significant predictors of RFS. The HR for death was 1.13 for IV compared to IV and SC, (95% CI 0.91-1.39). Stage (P < 0.0001) and Breslow thickness (P = 0.001) were significant independent predictors of OS. The available data suggest that where adjuvant high-dose interferon is being considered there is no evidence to deviate from the year long regimen described in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and Intergroup studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Labour is a period of significant physical activity. The importance of carbohydrate intake to improve outcome has been recognised in sports medicine and general surgery. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of oral carbohydrate supplementation on labour outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966-2014), Embase, the Cochrane Library and clinical trial registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCT) of women randomised to receive oral carbohydrate in labour (<6 cm dilated), versus placebo or standard care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Authors were contacted to provide data. Individual patient data meta-analyses were performed to calculate pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS: Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Six authors responded, four supplied data (n = 691). Three studies used isotonic drinks (one placebo-controlled, two compared with standard care), and one an advice booklet regarding carbohydrate intake. The mean difference in energy intake between the intervention and control groups was small [three studies, 195 kilocalories (kcal), 95% CI 118-273]. There was no difference in the risk of caesarean section (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.83- 1.61), instrumental birth (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.96-1.66) or syntocinon augmentation (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86-1.13). Length of labour was similar (mean difference -3.15 minutes, 95% CI -35.14 to 41.95). Restricting the analysis to primigravid women did not affect the result. Oral carbohydrates did not increase the risk of vomiting (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.78-1.52) or 1-minute Apgar score <7 (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.82-1.83). AUTHORS' CONCLUSION: Oral carbohydrate supplements in small quantities did not alter labour outcome. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Oral carbohydrate does not affect labour. But the difference between intervention and control equals 10 teaspoons sugar.

AB  - Background: Oseltamivir has been used to treat children with influenza for nearly 2 decades, with treatment currently approved for infants aged >/=2 weeks. However, efficacy and safety remain controversial. Newer randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs), not included in previous meta-analyses, can add to the evidence base. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to identify RCTs of oseltamivir therapy in children. We obtained individual patient data and examined protocol-defined outcomes. We then conducted a 2-stage, random-effects meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of treatment in reducing the duration of illness, estimated using differences in restricted mean survival time (RMST) by treatment group. We also examined complications and safety. Results: We identified 5 trials that included 2561 patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and 1598 in the intention-to-treat infected (ITTI) populations. Overall, oseltamivir treatment significantly reduced the duration of illness in the ITTI population (RMST difference, -17.6 hours; 95% confidence interval [CI], -34.7 to -0.62 hours). In trials that enrolled patients without asthma, the difference was larger (-29.9 hours; 95% CI, -53.9 to -5.8 hours). Risk of otitis media was 34% lower in the ITTI population. Vomiting was the only adverse event with a significantly higher risk in the treatment group. Conclusions: Despite substantial heterogeneity in pediatric trials, we found that treatment with oseltamivir significantly reduced the duration of illness in those with influenza and lowered the risk of developing otitis media. Alternative endpoints may be required to evaluate the efficacy of oseltamivir in pediatric patients with asthma.

AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a promising new treatment for major depression. While recent randomised, sham-controlled studies found tDCS to have antidepressant effects, it remains to be determined whether a tDCS treatment course may also enhance cognitive function independent of mood effects in depressed patients. This systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis examined cognitive outcomes from randomised, sham-controlled trials of tDCS treatment for major depression. Seven randomised, sham-controlled trials (n=478 participants, 260 in active and 218 in sham) of tDCS for major depression were included. Results showed no cognitive enhancement after active tDCS compared to sham for the 12 cognitive outcomes investigated. Active relative to sham tDCS treatment was associated with reduced performance gains on a measure of processing speed (beta=-0.33, 95% CI -0.58; -0.08, p=0.011). Active tDCS treatment for depression did not show cognitive benefits independent of mood effects. Rather, tDCS treatment relative to sham stimulation for major depression may instead be associated with a reduced practice effect for processing speed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the potential of vitamin D to prevent acute respiratory infections have yielded mixed results. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis has the potential to identify factors that may explain this heterogeneity. OBJECTIVES: To assess the overall effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and to identify factors modifying this effect. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) registry. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of supplementation with vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 of any duration having incidence of acute respiratory infection as a prespecified efficacy outcome were selected. STUDY APPRAISAL: Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool to assess sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors, completeness of outcome data, evidence of selective outcome reporting and other potential threats to validity. RESULTS: We identified 25 eligible RCTs (a total of 11,321 participants, aged from 0 to 95 years). IPD were obtained for 10,933 out of 11,321 (96.6%) participants. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARI among all participants [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.96; heterogeneity p < 0.001]. Subgroup analysis revealed that protective effects were seen in individuals receiving daily or weekly vitamin D without additional bolus doses (aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.91), but not in those receiving one or more bolus doses (aOR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.10; p = 0.05). Among those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D, protective effects of vitamin D were stronger in individuals with a baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration of < 25 nmol/l (aOR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.53) than in those with a baseline 25(OH)D concentration of >/= 25 nmol/l (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95; p = 0.006). Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (aOR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.20; p = 0.83). The body of evidence contributing to these analyses was assessed as being of high quality. LIMITATIONS: Our study had limited power to detect the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of upper versus lower respiratory infection, analysed separately. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation was safe, and it protected against ARIs overall. Very deficient individuals and those not receiving bolus doses experienced the benefit. Incorporation of additional IPD from ongoing trials in the field has the potential to increase statistical power for analyses of secondary outcomes. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42014013953. FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.

AB  - Importance: Whether and under which conditions D-cycloserine (DCS) augments the effects of exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and posttraumatic stress disorders is unclear. Objective: To clarify whether DCS is superior to placebo in augmenting the effects of cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and posttraumatic stress disorders and to evaluate whether antidepressants interact with DCS and the effect of potential moderating variables. Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to February 10, 2016. Reference lists of previous reviews and meta-analyses and reports of randomized clinical trials were also checked. Study Selection: Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were (1) double-blind randomized clinical trials of DCS as an augmentation strategy for exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy and (2) conducted in humans diagnosed as having specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Raw data were obtained from the authors and quality controlled. Data were ranked to ensure a consistent metric across studies (score range, 0-100). We used a 3-level multilevel model nesting repeated measures of outcomes within participants, who were nested within studies. Results: Individual participant data were obtained for 21 of 22 eligible trials, representing 1047 of 1073 eligible participants. When controlling for antidepressant use, participants receiving DCS showed greater improvement from pretreatment to posttreatment (mean difference, -3.62; 95% CI, -0.81 to -6.43; P = .01; d = -0.25) but not from pretreatment to midtreatment (mean difference, -1.66; 95% CI, -4.92 to 1.60; P = .32; d = -0.14) or from pretreatment to follow-up (mean difference, -2.98, 95% CI, -5.99 to 0.03; P = .05; d = -0.19). Additional analyses showed that participants assigned to DCS were associated with lower symptom severity than those assigned to placebo at posttreatment and at follow-up. Antidepressants did not moderate the effects of DCS. None of the prespecified patient-level or study-level moderators was associated with outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: D-cycloserine is associated with a small augmentation effect on exposure-based therapy. This effect is not moderated by the concurrent use of antidepressants. Further research is needed to identify patient and/or therapy characteristics associated with DCS response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The European Medicines Agency makes clinical study reports publicly available and publishes reasons for not approving applications for marketing authorization. Duloxetine has been approved in Europe for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in women. The reported adverse effects of duloxetine include mental health problems and suicidality. We obtained clinical study reports from the European Medicines Agency concerning use of this drug for stress urinary incontinence. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 4 randomized placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine (involving a total of 1913 patients) submitted to the European Medicines Agency for marketing approval for the indication of stress urinary incontinence in women. We used data from the clinical study reports (totalling 6870 pages and including individual patient data) to assess benefits (including frequency of incontinence and changes in quality-of-life scores, such as Patient Global Impression of Improvement rating) and harms (both general harms, including discontinuation because of adverse events, and harms related to suicidality, violent behaviour and their potential precursors, such as akathisia and activation [stimulating effects such as insomnia, anxiety and agitation]). RESULTS: Duloxetine was significantly better than placebo in terms of percentage change in weekly incontinence episodes (mean difference -13.56%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -21.59% to -5.53%) and change in Incontinence Quality of Life total score (mean difference 3.24, 95% CI 2.00 to 4.48). However, the effect sizes were small, and a sensitivity analysis (with removal of one trial) showed that the number needed to treat for a Patient Global Impression of Improvement rating of "much better or very much better" was 8 (95% CI 6 to 13). The numbers needed to harm were 7 (95% CI 6 to 8) for discontinuing because of an adverse event and 7 (95% CI 6 to 9) for experiencing an activation event. No suicidality, violence or akathisia events were noted. INTERPRETATION: Although duloxetine is effective for stress urinary incontinence in women, the rates of associated harm were high when individual patient data were analyzed, and the harms outweighed the benefits.

AB  - The response to antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia appears to vary, and as such it has been proposed that different subtypes of schizophrenia exist, defined by treatment-response. This has not been formally examined using meta-analysis. Randomised controlled trials comparing placebo and antipsychotics in acute treatment of schizophrenia listed in PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO from inception until 30 November 2018 were examined. Relative variability of symptomatic improvement in antipsychotic-treated individuals compared to placebo-treated individuals was quantified using coefficient of variation ratio (CVR). Mean difference in symptom change was quantified using Hedges' g. In addition, individual patient data from two clinical trials was examined in terms of both the distribution of total symptom change, and the variability of individual symptoms and symptom factors. In total, 11,006 articles were identified. Sixty six met inclusion criteria, reporting on 17,202 patients. Compared with placebo, antipsychotic-treated patients demonstrated greater total symptom improvement (g = 0.47, p < 0.001) and reduced variability in symptomatic improvement for total (CVR = 0.86, p < 0.001), positive (CVR = 0.89, p < 0.001), and negative symptoms (CVR = 0.86, p = 0.001). Lower variability in antipsychotic-response relative to placebo was associated with studies published earlier (z = 3.98, p < 0.001), younger patients (z = 3.07, p = 0.002), higher dose treatments (z = -2.62, p = 0.009), and greater mean-difference in symptom-change (z = -5.70, p < 0.001). In the individual patient dataset (N = 522 patients), antipsychotic treated patients did not show significantly increased variability for any individual symptom, and there was no evidence of a bimodal distribution of response. Compared to placebo, antipsychotic treatment shows greater improvement and lower variability of change in total, positive and negative symptoms. This is contrary to the hypothesis that there is a subtype of antipsychotic non-responsive schizophrenia. Instead our findings, provide evidence for a relatively homogeneous effect of antipsychotic treatment in improving symptoms of schizophrenia.

AB  - RATIONALE: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is theoretically beneficial for lung protection, but the results of clinical trials are inconsistent, with study-level meta-analyses suggesting no significant effect on mortality. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this individual patient data meta-analysis was to identify acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patient subgroups with differential outcomes from HFOV. METHODS: After a comprehensive search for trials, two reviewers independently identified randomized trials comparing HFOV with conventional ventilation for adults with ARDS. Prespecified effect modifiers were tested using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression models, adjusting for important prognostic factors and clustering effects. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data from 1,552 patients in four trials were analyzed, applying uniform definitions for study variables and outcomes. Patients had a mean baseline PaO2/FiO2 of 114 +/- 39 mm Hg; 40% had severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <100 mm Hg). Mortality at 30 days was 321 of 785 (40.9%) for HFOV patients versus 288 of 767 (37.6%) for control subjects (adjusted odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.46; P = 0.16). This treatment effect varied, however, depending on baseline severity of hypoxemia (P = 0.0003), with harm increasing with PaO2/FiO2 among patients with mild-moderate ARDS, and the possibility of decreased mortality in patients with very severe ARDS. Compliance and body mass index did not modify the treatment effect. HFOV increased barotrauma risk compared with conventional ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.96; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: HFOV increases mortality for most patients with ARDS but may improve survival among patients with severe hypoxemia on conventional mechanical ventilation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend treating patients with an internal carotid artery near occlusion (ICANO) with best medical therapy (BMT) based on weak evidence. Consequently, patients with ICANO were excluded from randomized trials. The aim of this individual-patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was to determine the optimal treatment approach. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases in January 2018. The primary outcome was the occurrence of any stroke or death within the first 30 days of treatment, analysed by multivariable mixed-effect logistic regression. The secondary outcome was the occurrence of any stroke or death beyond 30 days up to 1 year after treatment, evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: The search yielded 1526 articles, of which 61 were retrieved for full-text review. Some 32 studies met the inclusion criteria and pooled IPD were available from 11 studies, including some 703 patients with ICANO. Within 30 days, any stroke or death was reported in six patients (1.8 per cent) in the carotid endarterectomy (CEA) group, five (2.2 per cent) in the carotid artery stenting (CAS) group and seven (4.9 per cent) in the BMT group. This resulted in a higher 30-day stroke or death rate after BMT than after CEA (odds ratio 5.63, 95 per cent c.i. 1.30 to 24.45; P = 0.021). No differences were found between CEA and CAS. The 1-year any stroke- or death-free survival rate was 96.1 per cent for CEA, 94.4 per cent for CAS and 81.2 per cent for BMT. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that BMT alone is not superior to CEA or CAS with respect to 30-day or 1-year stroke or death prevention in patients with ICANO. These patients do not appear to constitute a high-risk group for surgery, and consideration should made to including them in future RCTs of internal carotid artery interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimum time for commencing antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of preeclampsia and its complications is unclear. Aggregate data meta-analyses suggest that aspirin is more effective if given prior to 16 weeks' gestation, but data are limited because of an inability to place women in the correct gestational age subgroup from relevant trials. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to use the large existing individual participant data set from the Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies Collaboration to assess whether the treatment effects of antiplatelet agents on preeclampsia and its complications vary based on whether treatment is started before or after 16 weeks' gestation. STUDY DESIGN: A meta-analysis of individual participant data including 32,217 women and 32,819 babies recruited to 31 randomized trials comparing low-dose aspirin or other antiplatelet agents with placebo or no treatment for the prevention of preeclampsia has been published previously. Using this existing data set, we performed a prespecified subgroup analysis based on gestation at randomization to antiplatelet agents before 16 weeks, compared with at or after 16 weeks, for 4 of the main outcomes prespecified in the Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies protocol: preeclampsia, death of baby, preterm birth before 34 weeks, and small-for-gestational-age baby. Individual participant data for the subgroups were combined in a meta-analysis using RevMan software. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I(2) statistic. The chi(2) test for interaction was used to assess statistically significant (P < .05) differences in treatment effect between subgroups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the effects of antiplatelet therapy for women randomized before 16 weeks' gestation compared with those randomized at or after 16 weeks for any of the 4 prespecified outcomes: preeclampsia, relative risk, 0.90, (95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.03; 17 trials, 9241 women) for <16 weeks and relative risk, 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.98; 22 trials, 21,429 women) for >/=16 weeks (interaction test, P = .98); death of baby, relative risk, 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.73-1.09; 15 trials, 8626 women) for <16 weeks and relative risk, 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.07; 21 trials, 22,336 women) for >/=16 weeks (interaction test, P = .80); preterm birth prior to 34 weeks, relative risk, 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.04; 19 trials, 9155 women) for <16 weeks and relative risk, 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.00; 25 trials, 22,117 women) for >/=16 weeks (interaction test, P = .91); and small-for-gestational-age baby, relative risk, 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.94; 13 trials, 6393 women) for <16 weeks and relative risk, 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.08; 18 trials, 14,996 women) for >/=16 weeks (interaction test, P = .08). CONCLUSION: The effect of low-dose aspirin and other antiplatelet agents on preeclampsia and its complications is consistent, regardless of whether treatment is started before or after 16 weeks' gestation. Women at an increased risk of preeclampsia should be offered antiplatelet therapy, regardless of whether they are first seen before or after 16 weeks' gestation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation modality that has been increasingly used for major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment. Although studies in healthy volunteers showed that the technique is well-tolerated, tDCS safety and acceptability have not been sufficiently explored in patients with MDD. METHODS: We collected individual patient data from 6 randomized clinical trials that had been previously identified in a systematic review and meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were safety (rate of adverse events) and acceptability (rate of dropouts). Secondary outcomes were clinical, demographic and treatment predictors of the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Dropout rates between active (8.8%) and sham (12%) groups were not significantly different (OR= 0.7, p=0.38). Adverse event rates between active (73.5%) and sham (68.3%) groups were not significantly different (OR= 1.4, p= 0.23). Higher current densities were associated with lower adverse event rates. LIMITATIONS: Dropout reasons were not systematically reported and adverse events were not collected using questionnaires standardized across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Active tDCS is as acceptable and safe as sham tDCS, as found in randomized clinical trials of MDD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies of a putative association between hormonal contraception (HC) and HIV acquisition have produced conflicting results. We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies from sub-Saharan Africa to compare the incidence of HIV infection in women using combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or the injectable progestins depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) with women not using HC. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Eligible studies measured HC exposure and incident HIV infection prospectively using standardized measures, enrolled women aged 15-49 y, recorded >/=15 incident HIV infections, and measured prespecified covariates. Our primary analysis estimated the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) using two-stage random effects meta-analysis, controlling for region, marital status, age, number of sex partners, and condom use. We included 18 studies, including 37,124 women (43,613 woman-years) and 1,830 incident HIV infections. Relative to no HC use, the aHR for HIV acquisition was 1.50 (95% CI 1.24-1.83) for DMPA use, 1.24 (95% CI 0.84-1.82) for NET-EN use, and 1.03 (95% CI 0.88-1.20) for COC use. Between-study heterogeneity was mild (I(2) < 50%). DMPA use was associated with increased HIV acquisition compared with COC use (aHR 1.43, 95% CI 1.23-1.67) and NET-EN use (aHR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.61). Effect estimates were attenuated for studies at lower risk of methodological bias (compared with no HC use, aHR for DMPA use 1.22, 95% CI 0.99-1.50; for NET-EN use 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.96; and for COC use 0.91, 95% CI 0.73-1.41) compared to those at higher risk of bias (p(interaction) = 0.003). Neither age nor herpes simplex virus type 2 infection status modified the HC-HIV relationship. CONCLUSIONS: This IPD meta-analysis found no evidence that COC or NET-EN use increases women's risk of HIV but adds to the evidence that DMPA may increase HIV risk, underscoring the need for additional safe and effective contraceptive options for women at high HIV risk. A randomized controlled trial would provide more definitive evidence about the effects of hormonal contraception, particularly DMPA, on HIV risk.

AB  - PURPOSE: We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis to assess the possible benefits and harms of statin therapy in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and to investigate effects in specific ARDS subgroups. METHODS: We identified randomised clinical trials up to 31 October 2016 that had investigated statin therapy versus placebo in patients with ARDS. Individual patient data from each trial were compiled. Conventional two-stage meta-analyses were performed for primary and secondary outcomes, and one-stage regression models with single treatment-covariate interactions for subgroup analyses. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS: Six trials with a total of 1755 patients were included. For the primary outcomes, there was no significant effect of statin therapy on 28-day mortality [relative risk (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.86-1.23], ventilator-free days (mean difference 0.34 days, 95% CI -0.68 to 1.36) or serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.84-1.53). There was a significantly increased incidence of raised serum creatine kinase or transaminase levels with statin therapy (106/879; 12.1%) versus control (78/876; 8.9%) (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.83, p = 0.015). There were no significant treatment-covariate interactions in the predefined subgroups investigated. CONCLUSIONS: We found no clinical benefit from initiation of statin therapy in adult patients with ARDS, either overall or in predefined subgroups. While there was an increased incidence of raised serum creatine kinase and transaminase levels, there was no difference in serious adverse events among groups. Therefore, we do not recommend initiation of statin therapy for the treatment of ARDS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether patients with specific subgingival microbiological profiles benefit more from adjunctive systemic antibiotics. AIMS: To answer the question: "What is the clinical benefit in periodontitis patients taking adjunctive systemic antimicrobials to non-surgical therapy, depending on pre-treatment detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria?" MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search was conducted in four electronic databases for randomized controlled trials reporting clinical outcomes following adjunctive antibiotic therapy for patients divided by baseline microbiological profiles. RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 643 papers, reduced to five after screening and author contact. Four of these studies were suitable for a fixed effects two-stage individual participant data meta-analysis adjusted for baseline data. Collectively, adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole yielded superior clinical results (measured as reduction of PPDs) compared to placebo. No significant differences were detected for the effect of adjunctive antibiotics by the detection of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans on PPDs >/= 5 mm (WMD = 1.16, 95% CI [-5.37, 7.68], I(2) = 37.8%) or other clinical outcomes. All included studies had low risk of bias. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence to suggest that baseline detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria should be used as criterion for prescribing adjunctive antibiotics, although only limited information on microbial data and specific antimicrobials was available for analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biweekly irinotecan (CPT-11) plus cisplatin (CDDP) combination (BIRIP) and CPT-11 alone are both expectable options for treating advanced gastric cancer (AGC) in a second-line setting. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of these two regimens in patients enrolled two randomized phase III trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient-level data from two randomized phase III trials were collected for this study. In both trials, patients with AGC refractory to S-1-based chemotherapy were randomly allocated to BIRIP (CPT-11, 60 mg/m(2); CDDP, 30 mg/m(2), q2w) or to CPT-11 (150 mg/m(2), q2w). RESULTS: Cumulative data from 290 eligible patients were evaluated. The OS was 12.3 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.5-14.1] in the BIRIP group and 11.3 months (95% CI 10.0-13.2) in the CPT-11 group (hazard ratio 0.87; 95% CI 0.68-1.12, P = 0.272), while PFS was significantly longer in the BIRIP group (4.3 months [95% CI 3.5-5.1]) than in the CPT-11 group (3.3 months [2.9-4.1]; HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.61-0.98, P = 0.035). The response rate was 20.5% in the BIRIP group and 16.0% in the CPT-11 group (P = 0.361). However, the disease control rate was significantly better in the BIRIP group (72.1%) than in the CPT-11 group (59.2%) (P = 0.032). The two groups did not differ significantly in the incidences of grade 3 or worse adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Both BIRIP and CPT-11 may be good therapeutic options for patients with AGC as second-line treatment. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN 000025367.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is clinically important to know who are likely to respond more or less to antidepressants. However, meaningful effect modifiers (variables associated with differential response depending on the treatment) are yet to be identified. METHODS: We conducted individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis and meta-regression to explore effect modifiers in placebo-controlled antidepressant trials conducted so far in Japan. RESULTS: We obtained access to IPD from seven placebo-controlled trials comparing bupropion, duloxetine, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine or venlafaxine with placebo in the acute phase treatment of major depression (total n=2803). The higher the guilt subscale score of the baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), the greater the difference in reduction in depression severity between the antidepressants and placebo at week 6, while the older the current age or the age at onset, the smaller the difference. At week 8, the guilt subscale score of HRSD and presence of suicidal ideation at baseline predicted greater, and the anhedonia subscale and insomnia subscale scores of HRSD and early response at week 2 predicted smaller, difference in reduction. LIMITATIONS: Different studies measured different sets of baseline variables and we were able to analyze only a limited set of candidate variables for effect modification. CONCLUSION: Age, age at onset, several HRSD subscales including guilt, anhedonia and insomnia, presence of suicidal ideation at baseline and early response are potential effect modifiers for response to antidepressants in the acute phase antidepressant treatment of major depression. Future trials need to measure these and additional variables in concerted efforts to enable matching of treatments with individual characteristics in depression.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis of 4 randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine if patients with degenerative disc disease who achieve radiographic fusion after single-level lumbar interbody arthrodesis have better clinical outcomes than patients with radiographic pseudarthrosis at 12 and 24 months postoperative. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The clinical relevance of successful fusion after lumbar arthrodesis with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 or iliac crest bone autograft has recently been questioned in the literature. METHODS: Individual patient-level data of 4 RCTs were obtained from the Yale University Open Data Access Project project and analyzed. Clinical outcomes (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]; Numeric Rating Scales [NRSs] for back and leg pain) were compared between patients with radiographically confirmed fusion and those with radiographic nonunion 1 and 2 years postoperative. The results of each study were first analyzed separately, and then were pooled by meta-analysis. The GRADE approach was applied to evaluate the level of evidence. RESULTS: A total of 496 patients with clinical and radiographic data at 1- and 2-year follow-ups were identified. Of these, 5.5% (95% confidence interval: 3.7; 8.3) had radiographic nonunion which did not require reoperation. Patients with fusion had better improvements in ODI (P < 0.001) and NRS back pain scores (P < 0.001). The overall percentage of fused patients with ODI and NRS back pain scores that exceeded the criteria for minimal clinically important differences was also significantly higher than that of patients with nonunion (ODI, odds ratio [OR] = 2.7, P = 0.019; NRS back pain, OR = 3.5, P = 0.033). The predictive values of fusion for clinical outcomes, however, were poor, with low specificity and low negative predictive values. CONCLUSION: The presence of radiographic fusion is clinically significant, as patients with fusion had better clinical outcomes at 1 and 2 years postoperative than those with nonunion; however, patient-centered clinical outcomes should also be taken into consideration as independent, complimentary variables when assessing treatment success.

The aim of this collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data is to determine the impact of continuous control of P cuff on the incidence of VAP. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching PubMed and references of relevant articles. Data from 3 prospective controlled trials (two randomized and one quasi-randomized), which evaluated the impact of continuous control of P cuff on the incidence of VAP, were obtained and pooled together. Three different devices were used to continuously control P cuff. VAP was diagnosed using clinical, radiologic, and quantitative microbiological criteria. The impact of continuous control of P cuff on VAP was assessed by Cox regression analysis, stratified on trial. RESULTS: 263 (48.4 %) patients received continuous control of P cuff, and 280 (51.5 %) patients received routine control of P cuff using a manometer. 36 (13.6 %) VAP were diagnosed in continuous control group, and 72 (25.7 %) in routine care group (HR 0.47, 95 % CI 0.31-0.71, p < 0.001). However, heterogeneity was apparent in continuous control effect size across trials (I (2) = 58 %, p = 0.085). The number of patients needed to treat to prevent one VAP episode was 8. No significant impact of continuous control of P cuff was found on duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or mortality. CONCLUSION: Continuous control of P cuff might be beneficial in reducing the risk for VAP. However, no significant impact of continuous control of P cuff was found on duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or mortality.

AB  - Background: From an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis from four randomized controlled trials comparing haemodialysis (HD) with post-dilution online-haemodiafiltration (ol-HDF), previously it appeared that HDF decreases all-cause mortality by 14% (95% confidence interval 25; 1) and fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) by 23% (39; 3). Significant differences were not found for fatal infections and sudden death. So far, it is unclear, however, whether the reduced mortality risk of HDF is only due to a decrease in CVD events and if so, which CVD in particular is prevented, if compared with HD. Methods: The IPD base was used for the present study. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for cause-specific mortality overall and in thirds of the convection volume were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard regression models. Annualized mortality and numbers needed to treat (NNT) were calculated as well. Results: Besides 554 patients dying from CVD, fatal infections and sudden death, 215 participants died from 'other causes', such as withdrawal from treatment and malignancies. In this group, the mortality risk was comparable between HD and ol-HDF patients, both overall and in thirds of the convection volume. Subdivision of CVD mortality in fatal cardiac, non-cardiac and unclassified CVD showed that ol-HDF was only associated with a lower risk of cardiac casualties [0.64 (0.61; 0.90)]. Annual mortality rates also suggest that the reduction in CVD death is mainly due to a decrease in cardiac fatalities, including both ischaemic heart disease and congestion. Overall, 32 and 75 patients, respectively, need to be treated by high-volume HDF (HV-HDF) to prevent one all-cause and one CVD death, respectively, per year. Conclusion: The beneficial effect of ol-HDF on all-cause and CVD mortality appears to be mainly due to a reduction in fatal cardiac events, including ischaemic heart disease as well as congestion. In HV-HDF, the NNT to prevent one CVD death is 75 per year.

AB  - BACKGROUND: OK-432 has been used as a cancer treatment for 40 years, and the immunostimulatory effects of OK-432 therapy have been intensely investigated in Japan. Recently, it has received attention as a possible booster for cancer vaccine treatments. Our previous meta-analysis based on summary measures revealed a significant improvement in the survival of patients with curatively resected gastric cancer. However, it is impossible to exclude the possibility of bias due to several prognostic factors. METHODS: We collected individual data for patients with stage III or stage IV gastric cancer after curative resection from 14 trials that were identified in a previous meta-analysis. Immunochemotherapy with OK-432 was compared with treatment with standard chemotherapy on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary end point was overall survival. Stratified survival analyses were performed with the trial as the stratification factor. Subgroup analyses were also performed according to the potential prognostic factors, which included pathological factors, splenectomy, and delayed-type hypersensitivity. RESULTS: There were 796 and 726 patients in the OK-432 and control groups, respectively. The median overall survival was 42.6 months for the OK-432 group and 32.3 months for the control group. The overall hazard ratio was 0.88 (95 % confidence interval 0.77-1.00, p = 0.050). No factor showed a statistically significant interaction in the subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that immunochemotherapy treatment with OK-432 could have a borderline significant effect for patients with stage III or stage IV gastric cancer after curative resection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A dexamethasone-sparing regimen consisting of palonosetron plus 1-day dexamethasone for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) has been studied previously. Here, we evaluate the noninferiority of the dexamethasone-sparing regimen in overall antiemetic control using a meta-analysis based on individual patient data (IPD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review for randomized trials reporting CINV outcomes for the comparison of palonosetron plus 1-day dexamethasone (d1 arm) versus the same regimen followed by dexamethasone on days 2-3 after chemotherapy (d3 arm) in chemotherapy-naive adult patients undergoing either moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC)-containing chemotherapy. PubMed and MEDLINE were searched electronically. A manual search was also conducted. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR; no emesis and no rescue medication) in the overall 5-day study period. The noninferiority margin was set at -8.0% (d1 arm-d3 arm). RESULTS: Five studies (n = 1,194) were eligible for analysis and all IPD was collected. In the overall study period, the d1 arm showed noninferiority to the d3 arm for CR as well as complete control (pooled risk difference in CR rate - 1.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.1 to 4.0%, I(2) = 0%; in complete control rate - 2.4%, 95% CI -7.7 to 2.9%, I(2) = 0%). There was no significant interaction between dexamethasone regimen and risk factors (type of chemotherapy, sex, age, and alcohol consumption). CONCLUSION: This IPD meta-analysis indicates that the dexamethasone-sparing regimen is not associated with a significant loss in overall antiemetic control in patients undergoing MEC or AC-containing chemotherapy, irrespective of known risk factors for CINV. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Although dexamethasone in combination with other antiemetic agents has been used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), it is of clinical importance to minimize total dose of dexamethasone in patients undergoing multiple cycles of emetogenic chemotherapy. This individual-patient-data meta-analysis from five randomized controlled trials (1,194 patients) demonstrated a noninferiority of the dexamethasone-sparing regimen for complete response and complete control of CINV. The outcomes were comparable across patients with different characteristics. These findings thus help physicians minimize use of the steroid and further reduce the burden of dexamethasone-related side effects in patients undergoing multiple consecutive courses of emetogenic chemotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The soil-transmitted helminths (STH), Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms, infect 1.5 billion people worldwide and cause an estimated burden of 3.3 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Current control strategies focus on morbidity reduction through preventive chemotherapy (PC) but the most commonly used recommended drugs (albendazole and mebendazole) are particularly inefficacious against T. trichiura. This, together with the threat of emerging drug resistance, calls for new control strategies, including co-administration with other anthelminthics. Ivermectin plus albendazole is widely used against lymphatic filariasis, but its efficacy and safety against STH infections has not yet been fully understood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of ivermectin-albendazole co-administration in five different databases (i.e. PubMed, ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, CENTRAL and clinicaltrials.gov) from 1960 to January 2018. Four studies reporting efficacy of ivermectin-albendazole against STH infections and five studies on its safety met the selection criteria and were included for quantitative analysis. Ivermectin-albendazole was significantly associated with lower risk (risk ratio (RR) = 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.31-0.62) for T. trichiura infection after treatment compared to albendazole alone. The co-administration revealed no or only a marginal benefit on cure and egg reduction rates over albendazole alone for A. lumbricoides and hookworm infections. Adverse events (AEs) occurring after ivermectin-albendazole co-administration were mostly mild and transient. Overall, the number of individuals reporting any AE was not different (RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.87-1.36) in co-treated and albendazole-treated patients. However, although not statistically significant, sub-group analysis showed a tendency for slightly more AEs in patients with filariasis treated with ivermectin-albendazole compared to those treated with albendazole alone (RR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.81-2.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a good tolerability and higher efficacy of ivermectin-albendazole against T. trichiura compared to the current standard single-dose albendazole treatment, which supports the use of this co-administration in PC programs. Large-scale definitive randomized controlled trials are required to confirm our results.

AB  - Aim: We sought to determine whether the optimal dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration after drug-eluting stent (DES) placement varies according to clinical presentation. Methods and Results: We performed an individual patient data pairwise and network meta-analysis comparing short-term (</=6-months) versus long-term (1-year) DAPT as well as 3-month vs. 6-month vs 1-year DAPT. The primary study outcome was the 1-year composite risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST). Six trials were included in which DAPT after DES consisted of aspirin and clopidogrel. Among 11 473 randomized patients 6714 (58.5%) had stable CAD and 4758 (41.5%) presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the majority of whom (67.0%) had unstable angina. In ACS patients, </=6-month DAPT was associated with non-significantly higher 1-year rates of MI or ST compared with 1-year DAPT (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.48, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 0.98-2.22; P = 0.059), whereas in stable patients rates of MI and ST were similar between the two DAPT strategies (HR 0.93, 95%CI 0.65-1.35; P = 0.71; Pinteraction = 0.09). By network meta-analysis, 3-month DAPT, but not 6-month DAPT, was associated with higher rates of MI or ST in ACS, whereas no significant differences were apparent in stable patients. Short DAPT was associated with lower rates of major bleeding compared with 1-year DAPT, irrespective of clinical presentation. All-cause mortality was not significantly different with short vs. long DAPT in both patients with stable CAD and ACS. Conclusions: Optimal DAPT duration after DES differs according to clinical presentation. In the present meta-analysis, despite the fact that most enrolled ACS patients were relatively low risk, 3-month DAPT was associated with increased ischaemic risk, whereas 3-month DAPT appeared safe in stable CAD. Prolonged DAPT increases bleeding regardless of clinical presentation. Further study is required to identify the optimal duration of DAPT after DES in individual patients based on their relative ischaemic and bleeding risks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials comparing short- (</=6 months) with long-term (>/=1 year) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after drug-eluting stent(s) (DES) placement have been insufficiently powered to detect significant differences in the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare clinical outcomes between short- (</=6 months) and long-term (1 year) DAPT and among 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year of DAPT post-DES placement by performing an individual patient data pairwise and network meta-analysis. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing DAPT durations after DES placement were searched through the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases and in international meeting proceedings. The primary study outcome was 1-year risk of MACE (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or definite/probable stent thrombosis). RESULTS: Four trials including 8,180 randomized patients were identified. At 1-year follow-up, short-term DAPT was associated with similar rates of MACE (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86 to 1.43; p = 0.44), but significantly lower rates of bleeding (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.94; p = 0.03) versus prolonged DAPT. Comparable results were apparent in the landmark period between DAPT discontinuation and 1-year follow-up (for MACE: HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.89; p = 0.42) (for bleeding: HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.91; p = 0.03). There were no significant differences in 1-year rates of MACE among 3-month versus 1-year DAPT, 6-month versus 1-year DAPT, or 3-month versus 6-month DAPT. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with prolonged DAPT, short-term DAPT is associated with similar rates of MACE but lower rates of bleeding after DES placement.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Collaborative care is an intensive care model involving several health care professionals working together, typically a physician, a case manager, and a mental health professional. Meta-analyses of aggregate data have shown that collaborative care is particularly effective in people with depression and comorbid chronic physical conditions. However, only participant-level analyses can rigorously test whether the treatment effect is influenced by participant characteristics, such as chronic physical conditions. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the effectiveness of collaborative care for depression is moderated by the presence, type, and number of chronic physical conditions. DATA SOURCES: Data were obtained from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and references from relevant systematic reviews. The search and collection of eligible studies was ongoing until May 22, 2015. STUDY SELECTION: This was an update to a previous meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers were involved in the study selection process. Randomized clinical trials that compared the effectiveness of collaborative care with usual care in adults with depression and reported measured changes in depression severity symptoms at 4 to 6 months after randomization were included in the analysis. Key search terms included depression, dysthymia, anxiety, panic, phobia, obsession, compulsion, posttraumatic, care management, case management, collaborative care, enhanced care, and managed care. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Individual participant data on baseline demographics and chronic physical conditions as well as baseline and follow-up depression severity symptoms were requested from authors of the eligible studies. One-step meta-analysis of individual participant data using appropriate mixed-effects models was performed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Continuous outcomes of depression severity symptoms measured using self-reported or observer-rated measures. RESULTS: Data sets from 31 randomized clinical trials including 36 independent comparisons (N = 10962 participants) were analyzed. Individual participant data analyses found no significant interaction effects, indicating that the presence (interaction coefficient, 0.02 [95% CI, -0.10 to 0.13]), numbers (interaction coefficient, 0.01 [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.02]), and types of chronic physical conditions do not influence the treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is evidence that collaborative care is effective for people with depression alone and also for people with depression and chronic physical conditions. Existing guidance that recommends limiting collaborative care to people with depression and physical comorbidities is not supported by this individual participant data meta-analysis.

AB  - AIMS: Statin pretreatment in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is understood to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF). However, this is based on observational and limited randomized trial evidence, resulting in uncertainty about any genuine anti-arrhythmic benefits of these agents in this setting. We therefore aimed to quantify precisely the association between statin pretreatment and postoperative AF among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: A detailed search of MEDLINE and PubMed databases (1st January 1996 to 31st July 2012) was conducted, followed by a review of the reference lists of published studies and correspondence with trial investigators to obtain individual-participant data for meta-analysis. Evidence was combined across prospective, randomized clinical trials that compared the risk of postoperative AF among individuals randomized to statin pretreatment or placebo/control medication before elective cardiac surgery. Postoperative AF was defined as episodes of AF lasting >/=5 min. Overall, 1105 participants from 11 trials were included; of them, 552 received statin therapy preoperatively. Postoperative AF occurred in 19% of these participants when compared with 36% of those not treated with statins (odds ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.31-0.54, P < 0.00001, using a random-effects model). Atrial fibrillation prevention by statin pretreatment was consistent across different subgroups. CONCLUSION: Short-term statin pretreatment may reduce the risk of postoperative AF among patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of varied lifestyle intervention programs designed to ameliorate excess gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant women with overweight or obesity compared with standard care, including effects on pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Seven clinical centers conducted separate randomized clinical trials to test different lifestyle intervention strategies to modify GWG in diverse populations. Eligibility criteria, specific outcome measures, and assessment procedures were standardized across trials. The results of the separate trials were combined using an individual-participant data meta-analysis. RESULTS: For the 1,150 women randomized, the percent with excess GWG per week was significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the standard care group (61.8% vs. 75.0%; odds ratio [95% CI]: 0.52 [0.40 to 0.67]). Total GWG from enrollment to 36 weeks' gestation was also lower in the intervention group (8.1 +/- 5.2 vs. 9.7 +/- 5.4 kg; mean difference: -1.59 kg [95% CI:-2.18 to -0.99 kg]). The results from the individual trials were similar. The intervention and standard care groups did not differ in preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, or birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral lifestyle interventions focusing primarily on diet and physical activity among women with overweight and obesity resulted in a significantly lower proportion of women with excess GWG. This modest beneficial effect was consistent across diverse intervention modalities in a large, racially and socioeconomically diverse US population of pregnant women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe, early-onset fetal growth restriction due to placental insufficiency is associated with a high risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity with long-lasting sequelae. Placental insufficiency is the result of abnormal formation and function of the placenta with inadequate remodelling of the maternal spiral arteries. There is currently no effective therapy available. Some evidence suggests sildenafil citrate may improve uteroplacental blood flow, fetal growth, and meaningful infant outcomes. The objective of the Sildenafil TheRapy In Dismal prognosis Early onset fetal growth Restriction (STRIDER) collaboration is to evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil versus placebo in achieving healthy perinatal survival through the conduct of randomised clinical trials and systematic review including individual patient data meta-analysis. METHODS: Five national/bi-national multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trials have been launched. Women with a singleton pregnancy between 18 and 30 weeks with severe fetal growth restriction of likely placental origin, and where the likelihood of perinatal death/severe morbidity is estimated to be significant are included. Participants will receive either sildenafil 25 mg or matching placebo tablets orally three times daily from recruitment to 32 weeks gestation. DISCUSSION: The STRIDER trials were conceived and designed through international collaboration. Although the individual trials have different primary outcomes for reasons of sample size and feasibility, all trials will collect a standard set of outcomes including survival without severe neonatal morbidity at time of hospital discharge. This is a summary of all the STRIDER trial protocols and provides an example of a prospectively planned international clinical research collaboration. All five individual trials will contribute to a pre-planned systematic review of the topic including individual patient data meta-analysis.

AB  - Background: Dual therapy (DT) with a ritonavir-boosted PI (PI/r) plus lamivudine has proven non-inferior (12% margin) to triple therapy (TT) with PI/r plus two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [N(t)RTIs] in four clinical trials. It remains unclear whether DT is non-inferior based on the US FDA endpoint (virological failure with a margin of 4%) or in specific subgroups. Methods: We performed a systematic search (January 1990 to March 2017) of randomized controlled trials that compared switching of maintenance ART from TT to DT. The principal investigators were contacted and agreed to share study databases. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of DT to TT based on the current FDA endpoint (4% non-inferiority margin for virological failure at week 48). We also analysed whether efficacy was modified by gender, active HCV infection and type of PI. Effect estimates and 95% CIs were calculated using generalized estimating equation-based models. Results: We found 881 references that yielded eight articles corresponding to four clinical trials (1051 patients). At week 48, 4% of patients on DT versus 3.04% on TT had experienced virological failure (difference 0.9%; 95% CI -1.2% to 3.1%), and 84.7% of patients on DT versus 83.2% on TT had <50 copies of HIV RNA/mL (FDA snapshot algorithm) (difference 1.4%; 95% CI -2.8% to 5.8%). Gender, active HCV infection and type of PI had no effect on differences in treatment efficacy between DT and TT. Conclusions: DT was non-inferior to TT using both current and past FDA endpoints. The efficacy of DT was not influenced by gender, active HCV infection status, or type of PI.

AB  - Aims: The prevalence of insomnia ranges from 36% to 91% in alcohol-dependent patients and may persist after alcohol withdrawal. Acamprosate has been shown to decrease insomnia in abstinent patients. Based on a large clinical trial database, the aim of the present study is to assess the efficacy of acamprosate in reducing insomnia, and if indeed it does reduce insomnia, to better understand its action mechanism. Short Summary: The aim of the study is to confirm the efficacy of acamprosate to reduce insomnia using an individual patient data meta-analysis. Twelve studies were found including 3508 patients. After a 6-month follow-up, the mean insomnia decrease over baseline was -26% and -45% for the placebo and acamprosate groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Methods: An individual patient data meta-analysis selected all the randomized trials of acamprosate in which insomnia was documented. Our main endpoint was insomnia change after a 6-month follow-up, measured by the validated Short Sleep Index (SSI) derived from the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scale. The meta-analysis was conducted using a two-level multilevel (patient/trial) mixed model with random treatment effect, random study effect and adjusting for baseline severity covariates. Results: Twelve studies were found including 3508 patients, 59.8% of whom were suffering from insomnia (95% CI 58.1-61.4). Psychiatric history, severe addiction, living alone and abnormal gamma-GT levels were found to be the risk factors of insomnia. After 6 months, the mean SSI decrease over baseline was -26% and -45% for placebo and acamprosate, respectively (treatment effect = 19%, 12.5-25.5; P < 0.001). By using a univariate mediation model, we found that the mediating effect of abstinence on insomnia accounted for 55.7% of the overall effect of acamprosate on insomnia reduction. Conclusions: Insomnia is prevalent among alcohol-dependent patients. It decreases spontaneously with abstinence but more frequently with acamprosate treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Women with a strong family history of breast cancer (BC) and without a known gene mutation have an increased risk of developing BC. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of screening using annual mammography with or without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for these women outside the general population screening program. METHODS: An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was conducted using IPD from six prospective screening trials that had included women at increased risk for BC: only women with a strong familial risk for BC and without a known gene mutation were included in this analysis. A generalised linear mixed model was applied to estimate and compare screening accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values) for annual mammography with or without MRI. RESULTS: There were 2226 women (median age: 41 years, interquartile range 35-47) with 7478 woman-years of follow-up, with a BC rate of 12 (95% confidence interval 9.3-14) in 1000 woman-years. Mammography screening had a sensitivity of 55% (standard error of mean [SE] 7.0) and a specificity of 94% (SE 1.3). Screening with MRI alone had a sensitivity of 89% (SE 4.6) and a specificity of 83% (SE 2.8). Adding MRI to mammography increased sensitivity to 98% (SE 1.8, P < 0.01 compared to mammography alone) but lowered specificity to 79% (SE 2.7, P < 0.01 compared with mammography alone). CONCLUSION: In this population of women with strong familial BC risk but without a known gene mutation, in whom BC incidence was high both before and after age 50, adding MRI to mammography substantially increased screening sensitivity but also decreased its specificity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study sought to evaluate the presence of a clinically relevant rebound phenomenon after dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) discontinuation in randomized trials. BACKGROUND: It is currently unknown whether clopidogrel discontinuation after short-term DAPT is associated with an early hazard of ischemic events. METHODS: The authors performed an individual participant data analysis and aggregate meta-analysis. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), defined as the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke. RESULTS: The study included 11,473 PCI patients with individual participant data from 6 randomized trials comparing short-term DAPT (3 or 6 months) versus long-term DAPT (12 months or more). During the first 90 days following clopidogrel discontinuation, there was no significant increase in the risk of MACCE between patients randomized to short-term DAPT compared with long-term DAPT (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71 to 1.98; p = 0.52; absolute risk difference 0.10%; 95% CI: -0.16% to 0.36%). The risk of MI or stent thrombosis was similar among patients randomized to short-term DAPT versus long-term DAPT (HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.46 to 1.90; p = 0.85). In the aggregate data meta-analysis of 11 trials including 38,919 patients, a higher risk of early MACCE was observed after long-term (>/=12 months) DAPT duration (HR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.69 to 3.09; p < 0.001) but not short-term (<12 months) DAPT duration (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.74; p for interaction = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing PCI with predominantly new-generation DES, discontinuation of clopidogrel after 3 or 6 months DAPT duration was not associated with an early increase in adverse clinical events. An early increase in MACCE was observed after long-term (>/=12 months) DAPT exposure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare glycemic control during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) in people with type 2 diabetes to identify patient characteristics that determine those best treated by CSII. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were selected comparing HbA1c during CSII versus MDI in people with type 2 diabetes. Data sources included Cochrane database and Ovid Medline. We explored patient-level determinants of final HbA1c level and insulin dose using Bayesian meta-regression models of individual patient data and summary effects using two-step meta-analysis. Hypoglycemia data were unavailable. RESULTS: Five trials were identified, with 287 patients randomized to receive MDI and 303 to receive CSII. Baseline HbA1c was the best determinant of final HbA1c: HbA1c difference (%) = 1.575 - (0.216 [95% credible interval 0.371-0.043] x baseline HbA1c) for all trials, but with largest effect in the trial with prerandomization optimization of control. Baseline insulin dose was best predictor of final insulin dose: insulin dose difference (units/kg) = 0.1245 - (0.382 [0.510-0.254] x baseline insulin dose). Overall HbA1c difference was -0.40% (-0.86 to 0.05 [-4.4 mmol/mol (-9.4 to 0.6)]). Overall insulin dose was reduced by -0.25 units/kg (-0.31 to -0.19) (26% reduction on CSII), and by -24.0 units/day (-30.6 to -17.5). Mean weight did not differ between treatments (0.08 kg [-0.33 to 0.48]). CONCLUSIONS: CSII achieves better glycemic control than MDI in people with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, with approximately 26% reduction in insulin requirements and no weight change. The best effect is in those worst controlled and with the highest insulin dose at baseline.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Selective digestive decontamination (SDD) and selective oropharyngeal decontamination (SOD) improved intensive care unit (ICU), hospital and 28-day survival in ICUs with low levels of antibiotic resistance. Yet it is unclear whether the effect differs between medical and surgical ICU patients. METHODS: In an individual patient data meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed and included all randomized controlled studies published since 2000. We performed a two-stage meta-analysis with separate logistic regression models per study and per outcome (hospital survival and ICU survival) and subsequent pooling of main and interaction effects. RESULTS: Six studies, all performed in countries with low levels of antibiotic resistance, yielded 16 528 hospital admissions and 17 884 ICU admissions for complete case analysis. Compared to standard care or placebo, the pooled adjusted odds ratios for hospital mortality was 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.93) for SDD and 0.84 (95% CI 0.73-0.97) for SOD. Compared to SOD, the adjusted odds ratio for hospital mortality was 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-0.97) for SDD. The effects on hospital mortality were not modified by type of ICU admission (p values for interaction terms were 0.66 for SDD and control, 0.87 for SOD and control and 0.47 for SDD and SOD). Similar results were found for ICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In ICUs with low levels of antibiotic resistance, the effectiveness of SDD and SOD was not modified by type of ICU admission. SDD and SOD improved hospital and ICU survival compared to standard care in both patient populations, with SDD being more effective than SOD.

AB  - Background: Physical activity may be beneficial in Huntington's disease (HD); however, studies to date have been underpowered to detect change. We combined data from five randomized controlled feasibility trials using individual patient data meta-analyses. Methods/Design: All trial interventions comprised a combination of supervised and self-directed physical activity, with varied emphasis on aerobic, strength, endurance, flexibility, and task training. Duration ranged from 8 to 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the modified Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Motor Score. Secondary outcomes included the Symbol Digit Modality Test, Berg Balance Scale, 30-second Chair stand, Timed Up and Go, Gait Speed, Physical Performance Test, Six-Minute Walk, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, EuroQol Health Utility Index, and Short-Form 36 Health Related Quality of Life Scale. The primary analysis utilized a two-stage approach. A one-stage approach was explored as a sensitivity analysis using a cross-classified (by study site) linear mixed-effects model. Results: One hundred twenty-one participants provided complete data. Risk of bias was moderate; however, primary outcomes were blind assessed. Primary pooled effect estimates adjusted for baseline modified motor score (95% confidence interval) were 0.2 (-2.1 to 2.6) favoring control. There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies. Conclusions: There was no evidence of an exercise effect on the modified motor score in these relatively short-duration interventions. Longer-duration trials incorporating supervised components meeting frequency, intensity, time, and type principles are required. Lack of common outcomes limited the analysis and highlight the importance of a core outcome set for evaluating exercise in HD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this post hoc analysis was to determine key patient and treatment-related factors impacting glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and hypoglycemia in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who were initiated to basal insulin (neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH] or glargine). METHODS: Using individual patient-level data pooled from 6 treat-to-target trials, 2600 patients with type 2 diabetes on oral antidiabetic agents initiated to insulin glargine or NPH and treated for 24 to 36 weeks were analyzed. RESULTS: Both treatments led to significant reduction in A1C levels compared with baseline, with no differences between treatment groups (mean +/- standard deviation; glargine: -1.32 +/- 1.2% vs NPH: -1.26 +/- 1.2%; P = 0.15), with greater reduction in the BMI >/=30 kg/m group than in the BMI <30 kg/m group. Glargine reduced A1C significantly more than NPH in the BMI <30 kg/m group (-1.30 +/- 1.18% vs -1.14 +/- 1.22, respectively; P = 0.008), but not in the BMI >/= 30 kg/m group (-1.37 +/- 1.19 vs -1.48 +/- 1.22, respectively; P = 0.18). Similar proportions of patients achieved A1C target of <7% (glargine 30.6%, NPH 29.1%; P = 0.39). Incidence of severe and severe nocturnal hypoglycemia was significantly lower in glargine versus NPH-treated patients (2.0% vs 3.9%; P = 0.04, and 0.7% vs 2.1%; P = 0.002, respectively), and occurred primarily in the BMI <30 kg/m group. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of basal insulin is highly effective in lowering A1C after oral antidiabetic agent failure. Glargine decreases A1C more than NPH in nonobese patients, and reduces the risk for severe and severe nocturnal hypoglycemia versus NPH both in obese and nonobese patients, but more so in nonobese patients. Thus, it is the nonobese patients who may benefit more from initiation of basal insulin as glargine than NPH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The erosion of the early mortality advantage of elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) compared with open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm remains without a satisfactory explanation. METHODS: An individual-patient data meta-analysis of four multicentre randomized trials of EVAR versus open repair was conducted to a prespecified analysis plan, reporting on mortality, aneurysm-related mortality and reintervention. RESULTS: The analysis included 2783 patients, with 14 245 person-years of follow-up (median 5.5 years). Early (0-6 months after randomization) mortality was lower in the EVAR groups (46 of 1393 versus 73 of 1390 deaths; pooled hazard ratio 0.61, 95 per cent c.i. 0.42 to 0.89; P = 0.010), primarily because 30-day operative mortality was lower in the EVAR groups (16 deaths versus 40 for open repair; pooled odds ratio 0.40, 95 per cent c.i. 0.22 to 0.74). Later (within 3 years) the survival curves converged, remaining converged to 8 years. Beyond 3 years, aneurysm-related mortality was significantly higher in the EVAR groups (19 deaths versus 3 for open repair; pooled hazard ratio 5.16, 1.49 to 17.89; P = 0.010). Patients with moderate renal dysfunction or previous coronary artery disease had no early survival advantage under EVAR. Those with peripheral artery disease had lower mortality under open repair (39 deaths versus 62 for EVAR; P = 0.022) in the period from 6 months to 4 years after randomization. CONCLUSION: The early survival advantage in the EVAR group, and its subsequent erosion, were confirmed. Over 5 years, patients of marginal fitness had no early survival advantage from EVAR compared with open repair. Aneurysm-related mortality and patients with low ankle : brachial pressure index contributed to the erosion of the early survival advantage for the EVAR group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Results from studies evaluating the effectiveness of focused psychosocial support interventions in children exposed to traumatic events in humanitarian settings in low-income and middle-income countries have been inconsistent, showing varying results by setting and subgroup (eg, age or gender). We aimed to assess the effectiveness of these interventions, and to explore which children are likely to benefit most. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) from 3143 children recruited to 11 randomised controlled trials of focused psychosocial support interventions versus waiting list. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycArticles, Web of Science, and the main local low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) databases according to the list of databases relevant to LMIC developed collaboratively by Cochrane and WHO Library, up to November, 2016. We included randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of focused psychosocial support interventions in children exposed to traumatic events in LMICs, compared with waiting lists (eg, inactive controls). We excluded quasi-randomised trials, studies that did not focus on psychosocial support interventions, and studies that compared two active interventions without control conditions. We requested anonymised data from each trial for each of the prespecified variables for each child who was randomly assigned. The main outcomes considered were continuous scores in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms assessed with rating scales administered immediately (0-4 weeks) after the intervention. We harmonised all individual items from rating scales using item response theory methods. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42013006960. FINDINGS: We identified a beneficial effect of focused psychosocial support interventions on PTSD symptoms (standardised mean difference [SMD] -0.33, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.14) that was maintained at follow-up (-0.21, -0.42 to -0.01). We also identified benefits at the endpoint for functional impairment (-0.29, -0.43 to -0.15) and for strengths: coping (-0.22, -0.43 to -0.02), hope (-0.29, -0.48 to -0.09), and social support (-0.27, -0.52 to -0.02). In IPD meta-analyses focused on age, gender, displacement status, region, and household size we found a stronger improvement in PTSD symptoms in children aged 15-18 years (-0.43, -0.63 to -0.23), in non-displaced children (-0.40, -0.52 to -0.27), and in children living in smaller households (<6 members; -0.27, -0.42 to -0.11). INTERPRETATION: Overall, focused psychosocial interventions are effective in reducing PTSD and functional impairment, and in increasing hope, coping, and social support. Future studies should focus on strengthening interventions for younger children, displaced children, and children living in larger households.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of immediate delivery an expectant management among women whose pregnancies were complicated by preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) in the late preterm period (from 34 0/7 weeks until 36 6/7 weeks of gestation). DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception until December 2016. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We included all randomized controlled trials with individual participant data reporting on late preterm PROM with randomization to immediate delivery or expectant management. The primary outcome was a composite of adverse neonatal outcomes: probable or definitive neonatal sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, respiratory distress syndrome, stillbirth, or neonatal death. TABULATION, INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Of eight eligible trials (total n=3,203 mothers), three (2,563 mothers, 2,572 neonates) had individual participant data available. The composite adverse neonatal outcome occurred in 9.6% of neonates in the immediate delivery group and 8.3% in the expectant management group (relative risk [RR] 1.20, 95% CI 0.94-1.55). Neonatal sepsis rates were 2.6% and 3.5%, respectively (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.47-1.15). Neonates in the immediate delivery group were more likely to be diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.10-1.97), and to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit or special care nursery (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.23) and had longer admissions. Mothers randomized to immediate delivery were less likely to have an antepartum hemorrhage (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34-0.95) or chorioamnionitis (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.13-0.35), but more likely to undergo cesarean delivery (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.47). CONCLUSION: In women with late preterm PROM, immediate delivery and expectant management resulted in comparable rates of the composite of adverse neonatal outcomes. Effects on individual secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes were mixed. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO, 42016032972.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency in acid beta-glucosidase. GD exhibits a wide clinical spectrum of disease severity with an unpredictable natural course. Plasma chitotriosidase activity and CC chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) have been exchangeably used for monitoring GD activity and response to enzyme replacement therapy in conjunction with clinical assessment. Yet, a large-scale head-to-head comparison of these two biomarkers is currently lacking. We propose a collaborative systematic review with meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) to compare the accuracy of plasma chitotriosidase activity and CCL18 in assessing type I (i.e., non-neuropathic) GD severity. METHODS: Eligible studies include cross-sectional, cohort, and randomized controlled studies recording both plasma chitotriosidase activity and CCL18 level at baseline and/or at follow-up in consecutive children or adult patients with type I GD. Pre-specified surrogate outcomes reflecting GD activity include liver and spleen volume, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and symptomatic bone events with imaging confirmation. Primary studies will be identified by searching Medline (1995 onwards), EMBASE (1995 onwards), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Electronic search will be complemented by contacting research groups in order to identify unpublished relevant studies. Where possible, IPD will be extracted from published articles. Corresponding authors will be invited to collaborate by supplying IPD. The methodological quality of retrieved studies will be appraised for each study outcome, using a checklist adapted from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. The primary outcome will be a composite of liver volume >1.25 multiple of normal (MN), spleen volume >5 MN, hemoglobin concentration <11 g/dL, or platelet count <100 x 10(9)/L. Effect size estimates for biomarker comparative accuracy in predicting outcomes will be reported as differences in areas under receiver operating characteristic curves along with 95% confidence intervals. Effect size estimates will be reported as (weighted) mean differences along with 95% confidence intervals for each biomarker according to outcomes. IPD meta-analysis will be conducted with both one- and two-stage approaches. DISCUSSION: Valid and precise accuracy estimates will be derived for CCL18 relative to plasma chitotriosidase activity in discriminating patients according to GD severity.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with bilateral breast cancer (BBC) are usually excluded from participating in clinical trials and little is known about the response and outcome of BBC to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to unilateral BC (UBC). METHODS: We prospectively captured the information on patients with BBC in our database treated within four neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials and collected retrospectively the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) defined as ypT0 ypN0, ypT0/is ypN0, ypT0 ypNX, clinical and histologic parameters. Synchronous carcinoma in the contralateral breast was considered as the non-indicator lesion. Patients with UBC only treated within the same neoadjuvant trials performed the control group. RESULTS: From the 6727 patients treated within 4 German neoadjuvant trials 119 (1.8%) patients have been identified with the diagnosis of BBC. The pCR rate (ypT0 ypN0) was 12.6% in the non-indicator lesion group versus 10.9% the indicator lesion group versus 20.9% for patients with unilateral disease (p = 0.003). There were more advanced tumor stages and positive axillary lymph nodes in the indicator lesion than in the nonindicator lesion or in UBC. In 52.5% the molecular subtype was identical between indicator and non-indicator lesion with more triple negative and HER2 positive BC in the group of UBC. The disease free survival rate (DFS) was 25.8% for patients with UBC versus 39.6% for patients with BBC. CONCLUSION: The selection for the indicator lesion was based on tumor size, nodal status and inclusion criteria. Patients with BBC patients had a lower pCR rate and a lower DFS.

AB  - RATIONALE: Studies suggest that patients with connective tissue disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (CTD-PAH) have a poorer treatment response to therapies for PAH compared with patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH), but individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been underpowered to examine differences within these subgroups. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of therapy for PAH in CTD-PAH versus IPAH. METHODS: We obtained individual participant data from phase III placebo-controlled RCTs of therapies for PAH submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for drug approval. A treatment-by-diagnosis interaction term evaluated differences in treatment response between CTD-PAH and IPAH. Outcomes included change in 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD) from baseline to 12 weeks, clinical worsening, and all-cause mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The study sample included 827 participants with CTD-PAH and 1,935 with IPAH from 11 RCTs. Patients with CTD-PAH had less improvement in 6MWD when assigned to active treatment versus placebo compared with patients with IPAH (difference in treatment effect on 6MWD in CTD-PAH vs. IPAH, -17.3 m; 90% confidence interval, -31.3 to -3.3; P for interaction = 0.043). Treatment was less effective in reducing the occurrence of clinical worsening in CTD-PAH versus IPAH (P for interaction = 0.012), but there was no difference in the placebo-adjusted effect of treatment on mortality (P for interaction = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for PAH was less effective in CTD-PAH compared with IPAH in terms of increasing 6MWD and preventing clinical worsening. The heterogeneity of treatment response supports the need for identifying therapies that are more effective for CTD-PAH.

AB  - Purpose The role of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) or induction chemotherapy (IC) in the treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma is controversial. The individual patient data from the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Nasopharynx Carcinoma database were used to compare all available treatments. Methods All randomized trials of radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy in nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were considered. Overall, 20 trials and 5,144 patients were included. Treatments were grouped into seven categories: RT alone (RT), IC followed by RT (IC-RT), RT followed by AC (RT-AC), IC followed by RT followed by AC (IC-RT-AC), concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT), IC followed by CRT (IC-CRT), and CRT followed by AC (CRT-AC). P-score was used to rank the treatments. Fixed- and random-effects frequentist network meta-analysis models were applied. Results The three treatments with the highest probability of benefit on overall survival (OS) were CRT-AC, followed by CRT and IC-CRT, with respective hazard ratios (HRs [95% CIs]) compared with RT alone of 0.65 (0.56 to 0.75), 0.77 (0.64 to 0.92), and 0.81 (0.63 to 1.04). HRs (95% CIs) of CRT-AC compared with CRT for OS, progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control, and distant control (DC) were, respectively, 0.85 (0.68 to 1.05), 0.81 (0.66 to 0.98), 0.70 (0.48 to 1.02), and 0.87 (0.61 to 1.25). IC-CRT ranked second for PFS and the best for DC. CRT never ranked first. HRs of CRT compared with IC-CRT for OS, PFS, locoregional control, and DC were, respectively, 0.95 (0.72 to 1.25), 1.13 (0.88 to 1.46), 1.05 (0.70 to 1.59), and 1.55 (0.94 to 2.56). Regimens with more chemotherapy were associated with increased risk of acute toxicity. Conclusion The addition of AC to CRT achieved the highest survival benefit and consistent improvement for all end points. The addition of IC to CRT achieved the highest effect on DC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The dose-effect relationship of fixed-dose combinations of anti-hypertensive drugs has been only poorly explored. This pooled analysis investigates the dose-response relationship of fixed-dose lercanidipine + enalapril in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an individual patient data analysis of four randomized studies (n = 2340). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP). Secondary variables were change from baseline in sitting systolic BP (SSBP), proportion of responder patients, and safety. RESULTS: All fixed-dose combinations were superior to placebo in the reduction of SDBP. The greatest effect was observed with the market-available combination lercanidipine 20 mg/enalapril 20 mg (-15.3 mmHg vs. baseline; p < 0.05). The reduction in SDBP associated with the other two marketed fixed combinations of lercanidipine/enalapril were -10.7 mmHg for the 10 mg/20 mg combination and -9.8 mmHg for the 10 mg/10 mg combination (p < .05 for both comparisons). Similar findings were reported for SSBP reduction: the greatest effect was observed with lercanidipine 20 mg/enalapril 20 mg (-19.2 mmHg). The reduction in SSBP was -12.5 mmHg for the 10 mg/20 mg combination and -11.1 mmHg for the 10 mg/10 mg combination (p < .05 for all comparisons). The highest responder rate was reported with lercanidipine 20 mg/enalapril 20 mg (75.0%); this figure was 56.1% with the 10 mg/20 mg and 53.0% with the 10/10 mg combination. No safety concerns were reported. CONCLUSION: This pooled analysis of four randomized studies shows evidence of a dose-response effect in BP reduction with different fixed combinations of lercanidipine + enalapril. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis investigating the dose-response effect of a specific fixed-dose combination of anti-hypertensive agents. Further studies on this intriguing topic are however necessary.

AB  - RATIONALE: Optimization of beta-lactam antibiotic dosing for critically ill patients is an intervention that may improve outcomes in severe sepsis. OBJECTIVES: In this individual patient data meta-analysis of critically ill patients with severe sepsis, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of those treated with continuous versus intermittent infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics. METHODS: We identified relevant randomized controlled trials comparing continuous versus intermittent infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients with severe sepsis. We assessed the quality of the studies according to four criteria. We combined individual patient data from studies and assessed data integrity for common baseline demographics and study endpoints, including hospital mortality censored at 30 days and clinical cure. We then determined the pooled estimates of effect and investigated factors associated with hospital mortality in multivariable analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified three randomized controlled trials in which researchers recruited a total of 632 patients with severe sepsis. The two groups were well balanced in terms of age, sex, and illness severity. The rates of hospital mortality and clinical cure for the continuous versus intermittent infusion groups were 19.6% versus 26.3% (relative risk, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-1.00; P = 0.045) and 55.4% versus 46.3% (relative risk, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.40; P = 0.021), respectively. In a multivariable model, intermittent beta-lactam administration, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, use of renal replacement therapy, and infection by nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli were significantly associated with hospital mortality. Continuous beta-lactam administration was not independently associated with clinical cure. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with intermittent dosing, administration of beta-lactam antibiotics by continuous infusion in critically ill patients with severe sepsis is associated with decreased hospital mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Placenta-mediated pregnancy complications include pre-eclampsia, late pregnancy loss, placental abruption, and birth of a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonate. These complications are leading causes of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality in high-income countries. Affected women are at high risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies; however, effective strategies to prevent recurrence are absent. Findings from our previous study-level meta-analysis suggested that low-molecular-weight heparin reduced the risk of recurrent placenta-mediated pregnancy complications. However, we identified significant heterogeneity in the results, possibly due to trial design or inclusion criteria. To identify which patients benefit from, and which outcomes are prevented by, low-molecular-weight heparin, we did an individual patient data meta-analysis. METHODS: We did a systematic review in May, 2013, which identified eight eligible randomised trials done between 2000 and 2013 of low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent recurrent placenta-mediated pregnancy complications. We excluded studies on the basis of the wrong population, the study being ongoing, inability to confirm eligibility of participants, intervention stopped too early, and no response from the principal investigator. We requested individual patient data from the study authors for eligible women (women pregnant at the time of the study with a history of previous pregnancy that had been complicated by one or more of the following: pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, birth of an SGA neonate [<10th percentile], pregnancy loss after 16 weeks' gestation, or two losses after 12 weeks' gestation) and recoded, combined, and analysed the data for our meta-analysis. The primary outcome was a composite of early-onset (<34 weeks) or severe pre-eclampsia, birth of an SGA neonate (<5th percentile), late pregnancy loss (>/=20 weeks' gestation), or placental abruption leading to delivery, assessed on an intention-to-treat basis. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42013006249. FINDINGS: We analysed data from 963 eligible women in eight trials: 480 randomly assigned to low-molecular-weight heparin and 483 randomly assigned to no low-molecular-weight heparin. Overall, the risk of bias was not substantial enough to affect decisions regarding trial inclusion. Participants were mostly white (795/905; 88%) with a mean age of 30.9 years (SD 5.0) and 403/963 (42%) had thrombophilia. In the primary analysis, low-molecular-weight heparin did not significantly reduce the risk of recurrent placenta-mediated pregnancy complications (low-molecular-weight heparin 62/444 [14%] versus no low-molecular-weight heparin 95/443 (22%) absolute difference -8%, 95% CI -17.3 to 1.4, p=0.09; relative risk 0.64, 95% CI 0.36-1.11, p=0.11). We noted significant heterogeneity between single-centre and multicentre trials. In subgroup analyses, low-molecular-weight heparin in multicentre trials reduced the primary outcome in women with previous abruption (p=0.006) but not in any of the other subgroups of previous complications. INTERPRETATION: Low-molecular-weight heparin does not seem to reduce the risk of recurrent placenta-mediated pregnancy complications in at-risk women. However, some decreases in event rates might have been too small for the power of our study to explore. FUNDING: Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of vaginal progesterone for preventing preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with a short cervix has been questioned after publication of the OPPTIMUM study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vaginal progesterone prevents preterm birth and improves perinatal outcomes in asymptomatic women with a singleton gestation and a midtrimester sonographic short cervix. STUDY DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CINAHL (from their inception to September 2017); Cochrane databases; bibliographies; and conference proceedings for randomized controlled trials comparing vaginal progesterone vs placebo/no treatment in women with a singleton gestation and a midtrimester sonographic cervical length </=25 mm. This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data. The primary outcome was preterm birth <33 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcomes included adverse perinatal outcomes and neurodevelopmental and health outcomes at 2 years of age. Individual patient data were analyzed using a 2-stage approach. Pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. RESULTS: Data were available from 974 women (498 allocated to vaginal progesterone, 476 allocated to placebo) with a cervical length </=25 mm participating in 5 high-quality trials. Vaginal progesterone was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of preterm birth <33 weeks of gestation (relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.81; P = .0006; high-quality evidence). Moreover, vaginal progesterone significantly decreased the risk of preterm birth <36, <35, <34, <32, <30, and <28 weeks of gestation; spontaneous preterm birth <33 and <34 weeks of gestation; respiratory distress syndrome; composite neonatal morbidity and mortality; birthweight <1500 and <2500 g; and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (relative risks from 0.47-0.82; high-quality evidence for all). There were 7 (1.4%) neonatal deaths in the vaginal progesterone group and 15 (3.2%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-1.07; P = .07; low-quality evidence). Maternal adverse events, congenital anomalies, and adverse neurodevelopmental and health outcomes at 2 years of age did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: Vaginal progesterone decreases the risk of preterm birth and improves perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with a midtrimester sonographic short cervix, without any demonstrable deleterious effects on childhood neurodevelopment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of vaginal progesterone for the prevention of preterm birth and neonatal morbidity and mortality in asymptomatic women with a twin gestation and a sonographic short cervix (cervical length </= 25 mm) in the mid-trimester. METHODS: This was an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) from randomized controlled trials comparing vaginal progesterone with placebo/no treatment in women with a twin gestation and a mid-trimester sonographic cervical length </= 25 mm. MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, CINAHL and LILACS (all from inception to 31 December 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Research Registers of ongoing trials, Google Scholar, conference proceedings and reference lists of identified studies were searched. The primary outcome measure was preterm birth < 33 weeks' gestation. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: IPD were available for 303 women (159 assigned to vaginal progesterone and 144 assigned to placebo/no treatment) and their 606 fetuses/infants from six randomized controlled trials. One study, which included women with a cervical length between 20 and 25 mm, provided 74% of the total sample size of the IPD meta-analysis. Vaginal progesterone, compared with placebo/no treatment, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of preterm birth < 33 weeks' gestation (31.4% vs 43.1%; RR, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.51-0.93); moderate-quality evidence). Moreover, vaginal progesterone administration was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of preterm birth < 35, < 34, < 32 and < 30 weeks' gestation (RRs ranging from 0.47 to 0.83), neonatal death (RR, 0.53 (95% CI, 0.35-0.81)), respiratory distress syndrome (RR, 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56-0.89)), composite neonatal morbidity and mortality (RR, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.34-0.98)), use of mechanical ventilation (RR, 0.54 (95% CI, 0.36-0.81)) and birth weight < 1500 g (RR, 0.53 (95% CI, 0.35-0.80)) (all moderate-quality evidence). There were no significant differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 4-5 years of age between the vaginal progesterone and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: Administration of vaginal progesterone to asymptomatic women with a twin gestation and a sonographic short cervix in the mid-trimester reduces the risk of preterm birth occurring at < 30 to < 35 gestational weeks, neonatal mortality and some measures of neonatal morbidity, without any demonstrable deleterious effects on childhood neurodevelopment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves prognosis of patients with locally advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to identify predictors for postoperative survival following neoadjuvant therapy. These could be useful in deciding about postoperative continuation of chemotherapy. METHODS: This meta-analysis used IPD from RCTs comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with surgery alone for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Trials providing IPD on age, sex, performance status, pT/N stage, resection status, overall and recurrence-free survival were included. Survival was calculated in the entire study population and subgroups stratified by supposed predictors and compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable Cox models were used to identify independent survival predictors. RESULTS: Four RCTs providing IPD from 553 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. (y)pT and (y)pN stage and resection status strongly predicted postoperative survival both after neoadjuvant therapy and surgery alone. Patients with R1 resection after neoadjuvant therapy survived longer than those with R1 resection after surgery alone. Patients with stage pN0 after surgery alone had better prognosis than those with ypN0 after neoadjuvant therapy. Patients with stage ypT3/4 after neoadjuvant therapy survived longer than those with stage pT3/4 after surgery alone. Multivariable regression identified resection status and (y)pN stage as predictors of survival in both groups. (y)pT stage predicted survival only after surgery alone. CONCLUSION: After neoadjuvant therapy for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, survival is determined by the same factors as after surgery alone. However, ypT stage is not an independent predictor. These results can facilitate the decision about postoperative continuation of chemotherapy in pretreated patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Automated weaning systems may improve adaptation of mechanical support for a patient's ventilatory needs and facilitate systematic and early recognition of their ability to breathe spontaneously and the potential for discontinuation of ventilation. Our objective was to compare mechanical ventilator weaning duration for critically ill adults and children when managed with automated systems versus non-automated strategies. Secondary objectives were to determine differences in duration of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, and adverse events. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to 30 September 2013 without language restrictions. We also searched conference proceedings; trial registration websites; and article reference lists. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined data using random-effects modelling. RESULTS: We identified 21 eligible trials totalling 1,676 participants. Pooled data from 16 trials indicated that automated systems reduced the geometric mean weaning duration by 30% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13% to 45%), with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 87%, P <0.00001). Reduced weaning duration was found with mixed or medical ICU populations (42%, 95% CI 10% to 63%) and Smartcare/PS (28%, 95% CI 7% to 49%) but not with surgical populations or using other systems. Automated systems reduced ventilation duration with no heterogeneity (10%, 95% CI 3% to 16%) and ICU LOS (8%, 95% CI 0% to 15%). There was no strong evidence of effect on mortality, hospital LOS, reintubation, self-extubation and non-invasive ventilation following extubation. Automated systems reduced prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Overall quality of evidence was high. CONCLUSIONS: Automated systems may reduce weaning and ventilation duration and ICU stay. Due to substantial trial heterogeneity an adequately powered, high quality, multi-centre randomized controlled trial is needed.

AB  - The apparent efficacy of d-cycloserine (DCS) for enhancing exposure treatment for anxiety disorders appears to have declined over the past 14 years. We examined whether variations in how DCS has been administered can account for this "declining effect". We also investigated the association between DCS administration characteristics and treatment outcome to find optimal dosing parameters. We conducted a secondary analysis of individual participant data obtained from 1047 participants in 21 studies testing the efficacy of DCS-augmented exposure treatments. Different outcome measures in different studies were harmonized to a 0-100 scale. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that, in participants randomized to DCS augmentation (n=523), fewer DCS doses, later timing of DCS dose, and lower baseline severity appear to account for this decline effect. More DCS doses were related to better outcomes, but this advantage leveled-off at nine doses. Administering DCS more than 60minutes before exposures was also related to better outcomes. These predictors were not significant in the placebo arm (n=521). Results suggested that optimal DCS administration could increase pre-to-follow-up DCS effect size by 50%. In conclusion, the apparent declining effectiveness of DCS over time may be accounted for by how it has been administered. Optimal DCS administration may substantially improve outcomes.

AB  - Background: Negative effects of psychological treatments have recently received increased attention in both research and clinical practice. Most investigations have focused on determining the occurrence and characteristics of deterioration and other adverse and unwanted events, such as interpersonal issues, indicating that patients quite frequently experience such incidents in treatment. However, non-response is also negative if it might have prolonged an ongoing condition and caused unnecessary suffering. Yet few attempts have been made to directly explore non-response in psychological treatment or its plausible causes. Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has been found effective for a number of diagnoses but has not yet been systematically explored with regard to those patients who do not respond. Methods: The current study collected and aggregated data from 2,866 patients in 29 clinical randomized trials of ICBT for three categories of diagnoses: anxiety disorders, depression, and other (erectile dysfunction, relationship problems, and gambling disorder). Raw scores from each patient variable were used in an individual patient data meta-analysis to determine the rate of non-response on the primary outcome measure for each clinical trial, while its potential predictors were examined using binomial logistic regression. The reliable change index (RCI) was used to classify patients as non-responders. Results: Of the 2,118 patients receiving treatment, and when applying a RCI of z >/= 1.96, 567 (26.8%) were classified as non-responders. In terms of predictors, patients with higher symptom severity on the primary outcome measure at baseline, Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.04, having a primary anxiety disorder (OR = 5.75), and being of male gender (OR = 1.80), might have higher odds of not responding to treatment. Conclusion: Non-response seems to occur among approximately a quarter of all patients in ICBT, with predictors related to greater symptoms, anxiety disorders, and gender indicating increasing the odds of not responding. However, the results need to be replicated before establishing their clinical relevance, and the use of the RCI as a way of determining non-response needs to be validated by other means, such as by interviewing patients classified as non-responders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of oral glucosamine in subgroups of people with hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA) based on baseline pain severity, body mass index (BMI), sex, structural abnormalities and presence of inflammation using individual patient data. METHODS: After a systematic search of the literature and clinical trial registries, all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of any oral glucosamine substance in patients with clinically or radiographically defined hip or knee OA were contacted. As a minimum, pain, age, sex and BMI at baseline and pain as an outcome measure needed to be assessed. RESULTS: Of 21 eligible studies, six (n=1663) shared their trial data with the OA Trial Bank. Five trials (all independent of industry, n=1625) compared glucosamine with placebo, representing 55% of the total number of participants in all published placebo-controlled RCTs. Glucosamine was no better than placebo for pain or function at short (3 months) and long-term (24 months) follow-up. Glucosamine was also no better than placebo among the predefined subgroups. Stratification for knee OA and type of glucosamine did not alter these results. CONCLUSIONS: Although proposed and debated for several years, open trial data are not widely made available for studies of glucosamine for OA, especially those sponsored by industry. Currently, there is no good evidence to support the use of glucosamine for hip or knee OA and an absence of evidence to support specific consideration of glucosamine for any clinically relevant OA subgroup according to baseline pain severity, BMI, sex, structural abnormalities or presence of inflammation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of cerclage for preventing preterm birth in twin pregnancies with a short cervical length. DESIGN: We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis. Searches were performed in electronic databases. SETTING: Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA. POPULATION: Twin pregnancies in mothers with short cervical length. METHODS: We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized trials of twin pregnancies screened by transvaginal ultrasound in second trimester and where mothers had a short cervical length <25 mm before 24 weeks. Eligible women had to be randomized to cerclage vs. no-cerclage (control). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was preterm birth <34 weeks. RESULTS: Three trials with 49 twin gestations with a short cervical length were identified. All original databases for each included trial were obtained from the primary authors. Risk factors were similar in the cerclage and control groups, except that previous preterm birth was more frequent and gestational age at randomization and delivery were earlier in the cerclage group compared with the control group. Adjusting for previous preterm birth and gestational age at randomization, there were no statistically significant differences in primary (adjusted odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 0.23-3.79) and secondary outcomes. Rates of very low birthweight and of respiratory distress syndrome were significantly higher in the cerclage group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Based on these Level 1 data, cerclage cannot currently be recommended for clinical use in twin pregnancies with a maternal short cervical length in the second trimester. Large trials are still necessary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extra-corporeal life support (ECLS) is a life-saving intervention for patients with hypothermia induced cardiac arrest or severe cardiovascular instability. However, its application is highly variable due to a paucity of data in the literature to guide practice. Current guidelines and recommendations are based on expert opinion, single case reports, and small case series. Combining all of the published data in a patient-level analysis can provide a robust assessment of the influence of patient characteristics on survival with ECLS. OBJECTIVE: To develop a prediction model of survival with good neurologic outcome for accidental hypothermia treated with ECLS. METHODS: Electronic searches of PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL were conducted with a hand search of reference lists and major surgical and critical care conference abstracts. Studies had to report the use of ECLS configured with a circuit, blood pump and oxygenator with an integrated heat exchanger. Randomized and observational studies were eligible for inclusion. Non-human, non-English and review manuscripts were deemed ineligible. Study authors were requested to submit patient level data when aggregate or incomplete individual patient data was provided in a study. Survival with good neurologic outcome was categorized for patients to last follow-up based on the reported scores on the Cerebral Performance Category (1 or 2), Glasgow Outcome Scale (4 or 5) and Pediatric Overall Performance Category (1 or 2). A one-stage, individual patient data meta-analysis was performed with a mixed-effects multi-level logistic regression model reporting odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Data from 44 observational studies and 40 case reports (n=658) were combined and analyzed to identify independent predictors of survival with good neurologic outcome. The survival rate with good neurologic outcome of the entire cohort was 40.3% (265 of 658). ECLS rewarming rate (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.98; p=.007), female gender (OR: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.69, 4.58; p<0.001), asphyxiation (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.35; p<0.001) and serum potassium (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.73; p<0.001) were associated with survival with a good neurologic outcome. The logistic regression model demonstrated excellent discrimination (c-statistic: 0.849; 95% CI: 0.823, 0.875). CONCLUSIONS: The use of extracorporeal life support in the treatment of hypothermic cardiac arrest provides a favourable chance of survival with good neurologic outcome. When used in a weighted scoring system, asphyxiation, serum potassium and gender can help clinicians prognosticate the benefit of resuscitating hypothermic patients with ECLS.

AB  - PURPOSE: To perform an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with or without whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for patients presenting with 1 to 4 brain metastases. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Three trials were identified through a literature search, and IPD were obtained. Outcomes of interest were survival, local failure, and distant brain failure. The treatment effect was estimated after adjustments for age, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) score, number of brain metastases, and treatment arm. RESULTS: A total of 364 of the pooled 389 patients met eligibility criteria, of whom 51% were treated with SRS alone and 49% were treated with SRS plus WBRT. For survival, age was a significant effect modifier (P=.04) favoring SRS alone in patients </=50 years of age, and no significant differences were observed in older patients. Hazard ratios (HRs) for patients 35, 40, 45, and 50 years of age were 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24-0.90), 0.52 (95% CI = 0.29-0.92), 0.58 (95% CI = 0.35-0.95), and 0.64 (95% CI = 0.42-0.99), respectively. Patients with a single metastasis had significantly better survival than those who had 2 to 4 metastases. For distant brain failure, age was a significant effect modifier (P=.043), with similar rates in the 2 arms for patients </=50 of age; otherwise, the risk was reduced with WBRT for patients >50 years of age. Patients with a single metastasis also had a significantly lower risk of distant brain failure than patients who had 2 to 4 metastases. Local control significantly favored additional WBRT in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: For patients </=50 years of age, SRS alone favored survival, in addition, the initial omission of WBRT did not impact distant brain relapse rates. SRS alone may be the preferred treatment for this age group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of antipsychotics across the initial severity range in patients with acute mania remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the influence of baseline severity on the efficacy of olanzapine. METHODS: We did an individual participant data meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that compared olanzapine with placebo, identified through searches of the ClinicalStudyRequest.com database on Feb 2, 2016. We included patients with acute mania associated with bipolar I disorder. We examined the association between baseline and change scores on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; range 0-60) up to 3 weeks for olanzapine versus placebo groups using eight increasingly complex competing mixed-effects models for repeated measures. FINDINGS: We identified 33 reports, five (15%) of which were eligible and contained data for 939 patients (552 received olanzapine; 387 received placebo). The interaction between baseline severity and treatment was significant (beta=0.22, 95% CI 0.05-0.39; p=0.013). The greater the baseline severity, the greater the magnitude of the differences between olanzapine and placebo was expected. The mean estimated YMRS scores were reduced at 3 weeks in both groups, but were greater with olazapine than placebo by 2.56 points for patients with a baseline score of 20-25 (9.26 for olanzapine vs 6.70 for placebo; effect size 0.35, 95% CI 0.11-0.60), by 4.74 points for a baseline score of 25-35 (14.25 vs 9.51; 0.58, 0.34-0.86), and by 8.01 points for a baseline score of 35-60 (21.72 vs 13.71; 0.70, 0.31-1.23). INTERPRETATION: Benefits of olanzapine can be expected for patients across the full spectrum of symptom severity who are likely to be treated for acute mania. Less severely ill patients seem to benefit less in terms of olanzapine efficacy, but still experience the same side-effects as more severely ill patients. Thus, clinicians and patients should carefully consider the benefit-to-risk ratio of olanzapine and its additional, prophylactic effect against relapse in the long term. The generalisability of these results to other antipsychotics, trial designs, and medical conditions remains to be established. FUNDING: None.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Time-average proteinuria (TAp) is the strongest predictor of renal survival in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Little is known about the utility and safety of corticosteroids (CS) to obtain TAp<1 g/d in patients with advanced IgAN. This study sought to evaluate TAp at different degree of baseline renal function and histologic severity during CS use and to investigate treatment safety. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We performed one-stage individual-patient data meta-analysis among 325 patients with IgAN enrolled in three prospective, randomized clinical trials. Patients were divided into three groups according to treatment: no treatment (NT; supportive therapy), CS, and CS plus azathioprine (CS+A). Associations of TAp with histologic grading, treatment, and eGFR at baseline were performed with linear regression models for repeated measures. The median follow-up duration was 66.6 months (range, 12-144 months). RESULTS: In the first 6 months, proteinuria did not change in the NT group and decreased substantially in the other groups(CS: from a mean+/-SD of 2.20+/-1.0 to 0.8 [interquartile range, 0.4-1.2] g/d; CS+A: from 2.876+/-2.1 to 1.0 [interquartile range, 0.5-1.7] g/d), independent of the degree of histologic damage and baseline eGFR. The percentage of patients who maintained TAp<1 g/d was 30.2% in the NT, 67.3% in the CS, and 66.6% in the CS+A group. Thirty-four patients experienced adverse events: none in the NT, 11 (6.4%) in the CS, and 23 (20.7%) in the CS+A group. The risk of developing adverse events increased with decreasing levels of eGFR (from 2.3% to 15.4%). The addition of azathioprine to CS further increased the percentage of patients with adverse events (16.8% versus 5.7% in study 2 and 30.0% versus 15.4% in study 3; overall P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IgAN, CS can reduce proteinuria and increase the possibility of maintaining TAp<1 g/d, regardless of the stage of CKD and the histologic damage. The risk of major adverse events is low in patients with normal renal function but increases in those with impaired renal function and with the addition of azathioprine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes have increased cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol and other lipids, but specific efficacy for patients with diabetes is unknown. We compared the effect of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab on lipid parameters in patients with and without type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We did a random-effects meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials comparing the efficacy of evolocumab, placebo, and ezetimibe to improve lipid parameters in adult patients (age 18-80 years) with or without type 2 diabetes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase to identify eligible 12-week, phase 3 trials published between Jan 1, 2012, and Feb 28, 2015. We excluded trials that included patients who had homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. All analyses were based on individual participant data. We used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects meta-analyses to compare the mean changes from baseline in concentrations of LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), and HDL cholesterol at 12 weeks for evolocumab, placebo, and ezetimibe. We also assessed the effect of evolocumab therapy compared with placebo across subgroups of patients based on glycaemia, insulin use, renal function, and cardiovascular disease status at baseline. RESULTS: Three trials met our inclusion criteria, and included 413 patients with type 2 diabetes and 2119 patients without type 2 diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes evolocumab caused mean reductions in LDL cholesterol concentration that were 60% (95% CI 51-69) versus placebo and 39% (32-47) versus ezetimibe. In patients without type 2 diabetes, evolocumab caused mean reductions in LDL cholesterol that were 66% (62-70) versus placebo and 40% (36-45) versus ezetimibe. In patients with type 2 diabetes, evolocumab was associated with reductions in non-HDL cholesterol (55% [47-63] vs placebo and 34% [26-41] vs ezetimibe), total cholesterol (38% [32-44] vs placebo and 24% [16-31] vs ezetimibe), and lipoprotein(a) (31% [25-37] vs placebo and 26% [16-35] vs ezetimibe), and an increase in HDL cholesterol (7% [4-11] vs placebo and 8% [4-13] vs ezetimibe). Findings were similar across diabetes subgroups based on glycaemia, insulin use, renal function, and cardiovascular disease status. INTERPRETATION: Evolocumab markedly reduces atherogenic lipoproteins in patients with type 2 diabetes, an effect that is consistent across subgroups and similar to that seen in patients without type 2 diabetes. Results from ongoing cardiovascular outcome trials of PCSK9 inhibitors will provide additional data to inform the use of these drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes. FUNDING: Amgen.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Endovascular thrombectomy with second-generation devices is beneficial for patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusions. Delineation of the association of treatment time with outcomes would help to guide implementation. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the period in which endovascular thrombectomy is associated with benefit, and the extent to which treatment delay is related to functional outcomes, mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Demographic, clinical, and brain imaging data as well as functional and radiologic outcomes were pooled from randomized phase 3 trials involving stent retrievers or other second-generation devices in a peer-reviewed publication (by July 1, 2016). The identified 5 trials enrolled patients at 89 international sites. EXPOSURES: Endovascular thrombectomy plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone; time to treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was degree of disability (mRS range, 0-6; lower scores indicating less disability) at 3 months, analyzed with the common odds ratio (cOR) to detect ordinal shift in the distribution of disability over the range of the mRS; secondary outcomes included functional independence at 3 months, mortality by 3 months, and symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. RESULTS: Among all 1287 patients (endovascular thrombectomy + medical therapy [n = 634]; medical therapy alone [n = 653]) enrolled in the 5 trials (mean age, 66.5 years [SD, 13.1]; women, 47.0%), time from symptom onset to randomization was 196 minutes (IQR, 142 to 267). Among the endovascular group, symptom onset to arterial puncture was 238 minutes (IQR, 180 to 302) and symptom onset to reperfusion was 286 minutes (IQR, 215 to 363). At 90 days, the mean mRS score was 2.9 (95% CI, 2.7 to 3.1) in the endovascular group and 3.6 (95% CI, 3.5 to 3.8) in the medical therapy group. The odds of better disability outcomes at 90 days (mRS scale distribution) with the endovascular group declined with longer time from symptom onset to arterial puncture: cOR at 3 hours, 2.79 (95% CI, 1.96 to 3.98), absolute risk difference (ARD) for lower disability scores, 39.2%; cOR at 6 hours, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.30 to 3.00), ARD, 30.2%; cOR at 8 hours,1.57 (95% CI, 0.86 to 2.88), ARD, 15.7%; retaining statistical significance through 7 hours and 18 minutes. Among 390 patients who achieved substantial reperfusion with endovascular thrombectomy, each 1-hour delay to reperfusion was associated with a less favorable degree of disability (cOR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.93]; ARD, -6.7%) and less functional independence (OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.92], ARD, -5.2% [95% CI, -8.3% to -2.1%]), but no change in mortality (OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.34]; ARD, 1.5% [95% CI, -0.9% to 4.2%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this individual patient data meta-analysis of patients with large-vessel ischemic stroke, earlier treatment with endovascular thrombectomy + medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone was associated with lower degrees of disability at 3 months. Benefit became nonsignificant after 7.3 hours.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether the efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) are uniform between sexes is unclear. We sought to compare clinical outcomes between short- (</=6 months) versus long-term (>/=1 year) DAPT after drug-eluting stent (DES) placement in women and men. METHODS AND RESULTS: We pooled individual patient data from 6 randomized trials of DAPT (EXCELLENT, OPTIMIZE, PRODIGY, RESET, SECURITY, ITALIC PLUS). The primary outcome was 1-year risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The main secondary outcome was 1-year risk of any bleeding. Out of the 11,473 randomized patients included in the pooled dataset, 3,454 (30%) were females. At 1-year follow-up, women had higher risk of MACE (3.6% vs. 2.8%; P = 0.01) but similar risk of bleeding (1.9% vs. 1.6%; P = 0.16) as compared with men. Compared with long-term DAPT, short-term DAPT was associated with similar rates of MACE in both women (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.62-1.25) and men (HR 1.25; 95% CI 0.95-1.6; P interaction = 0.08)]. At 1-year follow-up, short-term DAPT was associated with lower rates of bleeding as compared with long-term DAPT in both women (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.51-1.37) and men (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.40-0.84; P-interaction = 0.25). The presence of MVD was associated with higher MACE rates in the short-term DAPT group in women (HR: 1.16; CI 0.60-2.23) and men (HR: 2.29; CI 1.22-4.29; P interaction = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term DAPT is associated with similar rates of MACE but lower risk of bleeding when as compared with prolonged DAPT. There was no significant difference between sexes in the population studied. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Five years of prospective clinical trials confirm that the paclitaxel drug-coated balloon (DCB) (IN.PACT Admiral, Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) is safe and effective to treat femoropopliteal artery disease. A recent meta-analysis of heterogeneous trials of paclitaxel-based balloons and stents reported that they are associated with increased mortality and that higher doses are linked to higher mortality from 2 to 5 years. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a correlation between paclitaxel exposure and mortality by conducting an independent patient-level meta-analysis of 1,980 patients with up to 5-year follow-up. METHODS: Data from 2 single-arm and 2 randomized independently adjudicated prospective studies of a paclitaxel DCB (n = 1,837) and uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (n = 143) were included. Analyses of baseline, procedure, and follow-up data of individual patients were performed to explore correlations of paclitaxel dose with long-term mortality. Survival time by paclitaxel dose tercile was analyzed with adjustment of inverse probability weighting to correct baseline imbalances and study as random effect. A standard cohort was defined to compare DCB- and PTA-treated patients with similar characteristics by applying criteria from pivotal studies (n = 712 DCB, n = 143 PTA). RESULTS: A survival analysis stratified nominal paclitaxel dose by low, mid, and upper terciles; mean doses were 5,019.0, 10,007.5, and 19,978.2 mug, respectively. Rates of freedom from all-cause mortality between the 3 groups through 5 years were 85.8%, 84.2%, and 88.2%, respectively (p = 0.731). There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between DCB and PTA through 5 years comparing all patients (unadjusted p = 0.092) or patients with similar characteristics (adjusted p = 0.188). CONCLUSIONS: This independent patient-level meta-analysis demonstrates that this paclitaxel DCB is safe. Within DCB patients, there was no correlation between level of paclitaxel exposure and mortality.

AB  - Importance: General anesthesia during thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke has been associated with poor neurological outcome in nonrandomized studies. Three single-center randomized trials reported no significantly different or improved outcomes for patients who received general anesthesia compared with procedural sedation. Objective: To detect differences in functional outcome at 3 months between patients who received general anesthesia vs procedural sedation during thrombectomy for anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke. Data Source: MEDLINE search for English-language articles published from January 1, 1980, to July 31, 2019. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of adults with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of at least 10 and anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke assigned to receive general anesthesia or procedural sedation during thrombectomy. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Individual patient data were obtained from 3 single-center, randomized, parallel-group, open-label treatment trials with blinded end point evaluation that met inclusion criteria and were analyzed using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Degree of disability, measured via the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (range 0-6; lower scores indicate less disability), analyzed with the common odds ratio (cOR) to detect the ordinal shift in the distribution of disability over the range of mRS scores. Results: A total of 368 patients (mean [SD] age, 71.5 [12.9] years; 163 [44.3%] women; median [interquartile range] National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 17 [14-21]) were included in the analysis, including 183 (49.7%) who received general anesthesia and 185 (50.3%) who received procedural sedation. The mean 3-month mRS score was 2.8 (95% CI, 2.5-3.1) in the general anesthesia group vs 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0-3.5) in the procedural sedation group (difference, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.03-0.83]; cOR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.09-2.29]; P = .02). Among prespecified adverse events, only hypotension (decline in systolic blood pressure of more than 20% from baseline) (80.8% vs 53.1%; OR, 4.26 [95% CI, 2.55-7.09]; P < .001) and blood pressure variability (systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg or <120 mm Hg) (79.7 vs 62.3%; OR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.49-3.93]; P < .001) were significantly more common in the general anesthesia group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with acute ischemic stroke involving the anterior circulation undergoing thrombectomy, the use of protocol-based general anesthesia, compared with procedural sedation, was significantly associated with less disability at 3 months. These findings should be interpreted tentatively, given that the individual trials examined were single-center trials and disability was the primary outcome in only 1 trial.

AB  - Non-intervention-related effects have long been recognized in an array of medical interventions, to which surgical procedures like deep-brain stimulation are no exception. While the existence of placebo and micro-lesion effects has been convincingly demonstrated in DBS for major depression and Parkinson's disease, systematic investigations for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are currently lacking. We therefore undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis with the aim of quantifying the effect of DBS for severe, treatment-resistant OCD that is not due to the electrical stimulation of brain tissue. The MEDLINE/PubMed database was searched for double-blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical trials published in English between 1998 and 2018. Individual patient data was obtained from the original authors and combined in a meta-analysis. We assessed differences from baseline in obsessive-compulsive symptoms following sham treatment, as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Four studies met the inclusion criteria, randomizing 49 patients to two periods of active or sham stimulation. To preclude confounding by period effects, our estimate was based only on data from those patients who underwent sham stimulation first (n = 24). We found that sham stimulation induced a significant change in the Y-BOCS score (t = -3.15, P < 0.005), lowering it by 4.9 +/- 1.6 points [95% CI = (-8.0, -1.8)]. We conclude that non-stimulation-related effects of DBS exist also in OCD. The identification of the factors determining the magnitude and occurrence of these effects will help to design strategies that will ultimately lead to a betterment of future randomized clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In February, 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the blood infection marker procalcitonin for guiding antibiotic therapy in patients with acute respiratory infections. This meta-analysis of patient data from 26 randomised controlled trials was designed to assess safety of procalcitonin-guided treatment in patients with acute respiratory infections from different clinical settings. METHODS: Based on a prespecified Cochrane protocol, we did a systematic literature search on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase, and pooled individual patient data from trials in which patients with respiratory infections were randomly assigned to receive antibiotics based on procalcitonin concentrations (procalcitonin-guided group) or control. The coprimary endpoints were 30-day mortality and setting-specific treatment failure. Secondary endpoints were antibiotic use, length of stay, and antibiotic side-effects. FINDINGS: We identified 990 records from the literature search, of which 71 articles were assessed for eligibility after exclusion of 919 records. We collected data on 6708 patients from 26 eligible trials in 12 countries. Mortality at 30 days was significantly lower in procalcitonin-guided patients than in control patients (286 [9%] deaths in 3336 procalcitonin-guided patients vs 336 [10%] in 3372 controls; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.83 [95% CI 0.70 to 0.99], p=0.037). This mortality benefit was similar across subgroups by setting and type of infection (pinteractions>0.05), although mortality was very low in primary care and in patients with acute bronchitis. Procalcitonin guidance was also associated with a 2.4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure (5.7 vs 8.1 days [95% CI -2.71 to -2.15], p<0.0001) and a reduction in antibiotic-related side-effects (16% vs 22%, adjusted OR 0.68 [95% CI 0.57 to 0.82], p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Use of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic treatment in patients with acute respiratory infections reduces antibiotic exposure and side-effects, and improves survival. Widespread implementation of procalcitonin protocols in patients with acute respiratory infections thus has the potential to improve antibiotic management with positive effects on clinical outcomes and on the current threat of increasing antibiotic multiresistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In twin pregnancies, the rates of adverse perinatal outcome and subsequent long-term morbidity are substantial, and mainly result from preterm birth (PTB). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of progestogen treatment in the prevention of neonatal morbidity or PTB in twin pregnancies using individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched international scientific databases, trial registration websites, and references of identified articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17Pc) or vaginally administered natural progesterone, compared with placebo or no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Investigators of identified RCTs were asked to share their IPD. The primary outcome was a composite of perinatal mortality and severe neonatal morbidity. Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed for chorionicity, cervical length, and prior spontaneous PTB. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen trials included 3768 women and their 7536 babies. Neither 17Pc nor vaginal progesterone reduced the incidence of adverse perinatal outcome (17Pc relative risk, RR 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 0.97-1.4, vaginal progesterone RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.77-1.2). In a subgroup of women with a cervical length of </=25 mm, vaginal progesterone reduced adverse perinatal outcome when cervical length was measured at randomisation (15/56 versus 22/60; RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.47-0.70) or before 24 weeks of gestation (14/52 versus 21/56; RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.42-0.75). AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: In unselected women with an uncomplicated twin gestation, treatment with progestogens (intramuscular 17Pc or vaginal natural progesterone) does not improve perinatal outcome. Vaginal progesterone may be effective in the reduction of adverse perinatal outcome in women with a cervical length of </=25 mm; however, further research is warranted to confirm this finding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical benefit of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes remains uncertain. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality events in people with diabetes, we conducted an updated meta-analysis of published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and a pooled analysis of individual participant data (IPD) from three trials. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials of aspirin compared with placebo (or no treatment) in participants with diabetes with no known CVD were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and manual search of bibliographies to January 2019. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were used as the summary measures of associations. RESULTS: We included 12 RCTs based on 34,227 participants with a median treatment duration of 5.0 years. Comparing aspirin use with no aspirin, there was a significant reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)0.89 (0.83-0.95), with a number needed to treat (NNT)of 95 (95% CI 61 to 208) to prevent one MACE over 5 years average follow-up. Evidence was lacking of heterogeneity and publication bias among contributing trials for MACE. Aspirin use had no effect on other endpoints including all-cause mortality; however, there was a significant reduction in stroke for aspirin dosage </= 100 mg/day 0.75 (0.59-0.95). There were no significant effects of aspirin use on major bleeding and other bleeding events, though some of the estimates were imprecise. Pooled IPD from the three trials (2306 participants) showed no significant evidence of an effect of aspirin on any of the outcomes evaluated; however, aspirin reduced the risk of MACE in non-smokers 0.70 (0.51-0.96) with a NNT of 33 (95% CI 20 to 246) to prevent one MACE. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin has potential benefits in cardiovascular primary prevention in diabetes. The use of low dose aspirin may need to be individualised and based on each individual's baseline CVD and bleeding risk. Systematic review registration PROSPERO: CRD42019122326.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies show that intraoperative mechanical ventilation using low tidal volumes (VT) can prevent postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). The aim of this individual patient data meta-analysis is to evaluate the individual associations between VT size and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level and occurrence of PPC. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing protective ventilation (low VT with or without high levels of PEEP) and conventional ventilation (high VT with low PEEP) in patients undergoing general surgery. The primary outcome was development of PPC. Predefined prognostic factors were tested using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Fifteen randomized controlled trials were included (2,127 patients). There were 97 cases of PPC in 1,118 patients (8.7%) assigned to protective ventilation and 148 cases in 1,009 patients (14.7%) assigned to conventional ventilation (adjusted relative risk, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.88; P < 0.01). There were 85 cases of PPC in 957 patients (8.9%) assigned to ventilation with low VT and high PEEP levels and 63 cases in 525 patients (12%) assigned to ventilation with low VT and low PEEP levels (adjusted relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.37; P = 0.72). A dose-response relationship was found between the appearance of PPC and VT size (R2 = 0.39) but not between the appearance of PPC and PEEP level (R2 = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: These data support the beneficial effects of ventilation with use of low VT in patients undergoing surgery. Further trials are necessary to define the role of intraoperative higher PEEP to prevent PPC during nonopen abdominal surgery.

AB  - Background: Transfusion of blood products and mechanical ventilation with injurious settings are considered risk factors for postoperative lung injury in surgical Patients. Methods: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis was done to determine the independent effects of peri-operative transfusion of blood products, intra-operative tidal volume and airway pressure in adult patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for general surgery, as well as their interactions on the occurrence of postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Observational studies and randomized trials were identified by a systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and CENTRAL and screened for inclusion into a meta-analysis. Individual patient data were obtained from the corresponding authors. Patients were stratified according to whether they received transfusion in the peri-operative period [red blood cell concentrates (RBC) and/or fresh frozen plasma (FFP)], tidal volume size [</=7 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW), 7-10 and >10 mL/kg PBW] and airway pressure level used during surgery (</=15, 15-20 and >20 cmH2O). The primary outcome was development of postoperative ARDS. Results: Seventeen investigations were included (3,659 patients). Postoperative ARDS occurred in 40 (7.2%) patients who received at least one blood product compared to 40 patients (2.5%) who did not [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 2.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-4.33; P=0.008]. Incidence of postoperative ARDS was highest in patients ventilated with tidal volumes of >10 mL/kg PBW and having airway pressures of >20 cmH2O receiving both RBC and FFP, and lowest in patients ventilated with tidal volume of </=7 mL/kg PBW and having airway pressures of </=15 cmH2O with no transfusion. There was a significant interaction between transfusion and airway pressure level (P=0.002) on the risk of postoperative ARDS. Conclusions: Peri-operative transfusion of blood products is associated with an increased risk of postoperative ARDS, which seems more dependent on airway pressure than tidal volume size.

AB  - AIMS: To study the short-term cardiovascular effects of the once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist taspoglutide. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of individual-participant data from nine randomized controlled trials in the T-Emerge programme, which assessed the efficacy and safety of taspoglutide in type 2 diabetes. Our primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and acute myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalization for unstable angina. RESULTS: Overall, 7056 individuals were included in the analysis, and there were 67 primary endpoint events during 7478 person-years of follow-up (40 vs 27 events in the intervention vs control groups, respectively). The odds ratio for the composite endpoint among people randomized to taspoglutide was 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.57-1.56), which was robust across multiple subgroups. Longer-term data were not available as the development of taspoglutide was stopped because of gastrointestinal intolerance and serious hypersensitivity reactions. CONCLUSIONS: The available data suggest that short-term, once-weekly administration of taspoglutide was not associated with an excess risk of CVD, and provide insights relevant to the development of other novel once-weekly incretin mimetics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of prophylaxis for early adrenal insufficiency using low-dose hydrocortisone on survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in very preterm infants using an individual patient data meta-analysis. STUDY DESIGN: All existing randomized controlled trials testing the efficacy of the prophylaxis of early adrenal insufficiency using low-dose hydrocortisone on survival without BPD were considered for inclusion when data were available. The primary outcome was the binary variable survival without BPD at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. RESULTS: Among 5 eligible studies, 4 randomized controlled trials had individual patient data available (96% of participants identified; n = 982). Early low-dose hydrocortisone treatment for 10-15 days was associated with a significant increase in survival without BPD (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11-1.90; P = .007; I(2) = 0%), as well as with decreases in medical treatment for patent ductus arteriosus (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.93; P = .01; I(2) = 0%) and death before discharge (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.97; P = .03; I(2) = 0%). The therapy was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.33-4.69; P = .004; I(2) = 31.9%) when hydrocortisone was given in association with indomethacin exposure. The incidence of late-onset sepsis was increased in infants exposed to hydrocortisone (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.02-1.75; P = .04; I(2) = 0%), but no adverse effects were reported for either death or 2-year neurodevelopmental outcomes as assessed in an aggregate meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This individual patient data meta-analysis showed that early low-dose hydrocortisone therapy is beneficial for survival without BPD in very preterm infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided new-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation using a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from randomized trials. BACKGROUND: Published randomized trials that compare IVUS-guided versus angiography-guided new-generation DES implantation are scarce. METHODS: Searches of the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were performed to find randomized trials that compared IVUS-guided versus angiography-guided new-generation DES implantation. A total of 2,345 patients from 3 randomized trials were identified, and all patients were treated for long lesions or chronic total occlusions. Individual patient-level data were obtained. The primary endpoint was a major adverse cardiac event, a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis. An intention-to-treat analysis and per protocol analysis were performed. RESULTS: By 1 year post-procedure, major adverse cardiac events had occurred in 0.4% of the patients who underwent IVUS-guided DES implantation versus 1.2% of those who underwent angiography-guided DES implantation (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13 to 0.99; p = 0.040). For the IVUS-guided group, favorable clinical outcomes were observed for myocardial infarction (0% vs. 0.4%; HR: 0.09; p = 0.026). In addition, the clinical benefit of IVUS guidance was stronger in the per protocol analysis (HR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.89; p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with angiographic guidance, IVUS-guided new-generation DES implantation was associated with favorable outcomes in terms of major adverse cardiac events, the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis. These findings must be interpreted only for complex lesions, because all identified patients had long lesions or chronic total occlusions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lixisenatide is a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Its efficacy and safety have been assessed in a series of phase 3 studies included in the GetGoal program. In these studies, lixisenatide was found to be superior to placebo in glycemic control. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy of lixisenatide as an adjunct therapy in Asian patients with T2DM in adequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis from five lixisenatide phase 3 studies. In each of these multiethnic studies, patients with T2DM inadequately controlled (glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c >/=7%) with established OADs were randomized to lixisenatide or placebo for 24 weeks, with a balanced distribution of Asian patients in these two arms (503 and 338 patients in the intent-to-treat population, respectively). RESULTS: Lixisenatide was superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c (weighted, total mean difference -0.57%; P = 0.002). More patients treated with lixisenatide versus placebo achieved HbA1c targets of </=7% (49.1% vs. 28.4%, P = 0.003). Lixisenatide was superior to placebo in lowering 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG) (weighted, total mean difference -5.50 mmol/l, P = 0.0005). More patients treated with lixisenatide versus placebo achieved 2-h PPG targets of </=7.8 mmol/l (39.2% vs. 2.2%, P < 0.0001). More patients treated with lixisenatide versus placebo achieved both an HbA1c target of </=7% and a 2-h PPG target of </=10 mmol/l (34.8% vs. 2.69%, P < 0.00001). The body weight of the lixisenatide group tended to decrease. Lixisenatide was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Lixisenatide as an adjunct therapy can significantly improve the glycemic control of Asian patients with type 2 DM who do not meet targets for glycemic control with an established OAD regimen.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Abnormal circadian oscillations of blood pressure (BP) and nocturnal-diurnal BP differences (i.e., dipping) increase cardiovascular risk. Whether inorganic nitrate supplementation influences 24-hr BP variability is currently unknown. We studied the effects of high-nitrate beetroot juice supplementation on BP variability measured by 24-hr ambulatory BP monitoring (24-hr ABPM) in older subjects. METHODS: Data from four independent randomised clinical trials were collated. Eighty-five older participants (age range: 55-76 years) were included in the final database. Two trials had an open-label, parallel design and two trials had a cross-over, double-blind design. Participants were randomised to either beetroot juice or placebo. Changes in 24-hr ABPM (daily, diurnal, nocturnal), variability (weighted-SDs), night-dipping, morning surge for systolic and diastolic BP were measured. Meta-analysis was conducted to obtain pooled estimates of the effect size for each BP outcome. Sub-group analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of age, BMI, gender, BP status and changes in nitrite concentrations on the effect size. RESULTS: The pooled effect of beetroot juice on all BP outcomes was not significant. Beetroot juice ingestion determined a significant decrease in nocturnal systolic BP variability in subjects aged less than 65 y (2.8 mmHg, -4.5 -1.0, p = 0.002) compared to the older group (>/= 65 y; 1.0 mmHg, -2.2 4.2, p = 0.54). A greater change in NO2(-) concentrations after beetroot supplementation was associated with significant differences for nocturnal mean (-3.4 mmHg, -0.6 -2.4, p = 0.02) and variability (-0.8 mmHg, -1.5 -0.06, p = 0.03) of systolic BP. CONCLUSIONS: The vascular responsiveness to inorganic nitrate may be modified by mechanisms of vascular ageing influencing the reducing capacity to convert inorganic nitrate into nitrite and tissue-specific responses to dietary nitrate supplementation.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Low vitamin B12 and folate levels in community-dwelling older people are usually corrected with supplements. However, the effect of this supplementation on haematological parameters in older persons is not known. Therefore, we executed a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). SUBJECTS/METHODS: We performed a systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane and CENTRAL for RCTs published between January 1950 and April 2016, where community-dwelling elderly (60+ years) who were treated with vitamin B12 or folic acid or placebo. The presence of anaemia was not required. We analysed the data on haematological parameters with a two-stage IPD meta-analysis. RESULTS: We found 494 full papers covering 14 studies. Data were shared by the authors of four RCTs comparing vitamin B12 with placebo (n = 343) and of three RCTs comparing folic acid with placebo (n = 929). We found no effect of vitamin B12 supplementation on haemoglobin (change 0.00 g/dL, 95% CI: -0.19;0.18), and no effect of folic acid supplementation (change -0.09 g/dL, 95% CI: -0.19;0.01). The effects of supplementation on other haematological parameters were similar. The effects did not differ by sex or by age group. Also, no effect was found in a subgroup of patients with anaemia and a subgroup of patients who were treated >4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the effects of supplementation of low concentrations of vitamin B12 and folate on haematological parameters in community-dwelling older people is inconclusive. Further research is needed before firm recommendations can be made concerning the supplementation of vitamin B12 and folate.

AB  - People with schizophrenia are at considerably higher risk of cardiometabolic morbidity than the general population. Second-generation antipsychotic drugs contribute to that risk partly through their weight gain effects, exacerbating an already high burden of disease. While standard 'as-randomized' analyses of clinical trials provide valuable information, they ignore adherence patterns across treatment arms, confounding estimates of realized treatment exposure on outcome. We assess the effect of specific second-generation antipsychotics on weight gain, defined as at least a 7% increase in weight from randomization, using a Bayesian hierarchical model network meta-analysis with individual patient level data. Our data consisted of 14 randomized clinical trials contributing 5923 subjects (mean age = 39 [SD = 12]) assessing various combinations of olanzapine (n = 533), paliperidone (n = 3482), risperidone (n = 540), and placebo (n = 1368). The median time from randomization to dropout or trial completion was 6 weeks (range: 0-60 weeks). The unadjusted probability of weight gain in the placebo group was 4.8% across trials. For each 10 g chlorpromazine equivalent dose increase in olanzapine, the odds of weight gain increased by 5 (95% credible interval: 1.4, 5.3); the effect of risperidone (odds ratio = 1.6 [0.25, 9.1]) was estimated with considerable uncertainty but no different from paliperidone (odds ratio = 1.3 [1.2, 1.5]).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a negative prognostic factor in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is associated with permanent shunt dependency in a substantial proportion of patients post-ICH. IVH treatment by intraventricular fibrinolysis (IVF) was recently linked to reduced mortality rates in the CLEAR III study and IVF represents a safe and effective strategy to hasten clot resolution that may reduce shunt rates. Additionally, promising results from observational studies reported reductions in shunt dependency for a combined treatment approach of IVF plus lumbar drains (LDs). The present randomized, controlled trial investigated efficacy and safety of a combined strategy-IVF plus LD versus IVF alone-on shunt dependency in patients with ICH and severe IVH. METHODS: This randomized, open-label, parallel-group study included patients aged 18 to 85 years, prehospital modified Rankin Scale </=3, ICH volume < 60ml, Glasgow Coma Scale of <9, and severe IVH with tamponade of the third and fourth ventricles requiring placement of external ventricular drainage (EVD). Over a 3-year recruitment period, patients were allocated to either standard treatment (control group receiving IVF consisting of 1mg of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator every 8 hours until clot clearance of third and fourth ventricles) or a combined treatment approach of IVF and-upon clot clearance of third and fourth ventricles-subsequent placement of an LD for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; intervention group). The primary endpoint consisted of permanent shunt placement indicated after a total of three unsuccessful EVD clamping attempts or need for CSF drainage longer than 14 days in both groups. Secondary endpoints included IVF- and LD-related safety, such as bleeding or infections, and functional outcome at 90 and 180 days. Conducted endpoint analyses used individual patient data meta-analyses. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01041950). RESULTS: The trial was stopped upon predefined interim analysis after 30 patients because of significant efficacy of tested intervention. The primary endpoint was analyzed without dropouts and was reached in 43% (7 of 16) of the control group versus 0% (0 of 14) of the intervention group (p = 0.007). Meta-analyses were based on overall 97 patients, 45 patients receiving IVF plus LD versus 42 with IVF only. Meta-analyses on shunt dependency showed an absolute risk reduction of 24% for the intervention (LD, 2.2% [1 of 45] vs no-LD, 26.2% [11 of 42]; odds ratio [OR] = 0.062; confidence interval [CI], 0.011-0.361; p = 0.002). Secondary endpoints did not show significant differences for CSF infections (OR = 0.869;CI, 0.445-1.695; p = 0.680) and functional outcome at 90 days (OR = 0.478; CI, 0.190-1.201; p = 0.116), yet bleeding complications were significantly reduced in favor of the intervention (OR = 0.401; CI, 0.302-0.532; p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: The present trial and individual patient data meta-analyses provide evidence that, in patients with severe IVH, as compared to IVF alone, a combined approach of IVF plus LD treatment is feasible and safe and significantly reduces rates of permanent shunt dependency for aresorptive hydrocephalus post-ICH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chagas disease is a neglected chronic condition caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, with high prevalence and burden in Latin America. Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, and amiodarone has been widely used for this purpose. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of amiodarone in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. METHODOLOGY: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS up to January 2018. Data from randomized and observational studies evaluating amiodarone use in Chagas cardiomyopathy were included. Two reviewers selected the studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Overall quality of evidence was accessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We included 9 studies (3 before-after studies, 5 case series and 1 randomized controlled trial). Two studies with a total of 38 patients had the full dataset, allowing individual patient data (IPD) analysis. In 24-hour Holter, amiodarone reduced the number of ventricular tachycardia episodes in 99.9% (95%CI 99.8%-100%), ventricular premature beats in 93.1% (95%CI 82%-97.4%) and the incidence of ventricular couplets in 79% (RR 0.21, 95%CI 0.11-0.39). Studies not included in the IPD analysis showed a reduction of ventricular premature beats (5 studies), ventricular tachycardia (6 studies) and ventricular couplets (1 study). We pooled the incidence of adverse side effects with random effects meta-analysis; amiodarone was associated with corneal microdeposits (61.1%, 95%CI 19.0-91.3, 5 studies), gastrointestinal events (16.1%, 95%CI 6.61-34.2, 3 studies), sinus bradycardia (12.7%, 95%CI 3.71-35.5, 6 studies), dermatological events (10.6%, 95%CI 4.77-21.9, 3 studies) and drug discontinuation (7.68%, 95%CI 4.17-13.7, 5 studies). Quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. CONCLUSIONS: Amiodarone is effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias, but there is no evidence for hard endpoints (sudden death, hospitalization). Although our findings support the use of amiodarone, it is important to balance the potential benefits and harms at the individual level for decision-making.

AB  - Importance: Bioresorbable scaffolds were designed to provide clinical benefits after their complete bioresorption. Prior studies demonstrated early risks with the Absorb polymeric bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS). Whether this risk profile changes over time during the course of its bioresorption is unknown. Objective: To examine outcomes of the first-generation BVS before and after 3 years, the point of its complete bioresorption in animals. Data Sources: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane database, conference proceedings, and public websites for relevant studies. Study Selection: Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials of BVS vs metallic drug-eluting stents in patients with coronary artery disease with at least 5-year follow-up. Four trials of BVS vs everolimus-eluting stents (EES) with 3384 patients met criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Individual patient data from the 4 trials were pooled, and summary-level meta-analysis was performed. Main Outcomes and Measures: The major effectiveness and safety measures were target lesion failure (TLF; cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization) and device thrombosis. Outcomes were examined through 5-year follow-up and between 0 to 3 and 3 to 5 years. Results: Mean age for the 3384 patients was 62.8 years; 2452 patients were men (72.5%), and diabetes was present in 1020 patients (30.2%). Through 5-year follow-up, treatment with BVS compared with EES was associated with higher rates of TLF (14.9% vs 11.6%; HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.03-1.54; P = .03) and device thrombosis (2.5% vs 0.8%; HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.46-5.65; P = .002). Target lesion failure occurred in 11.6% of BVS-treated patients vs 7.9% of EES-treated patients between 0 to 3 years (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.12-1.80), and 4.3% of BVS-treated patients vs 4.5% of EES-treated patients between 3 to 5 years (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.64-1.31) (P for interaction = .046). Device thrombosis occurred in 2.4% of BVS-treated patients vs 0.6% of EES-treated patients between 0 to 3 years (HR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.75-8.50) and 0.1% of BVS-treated patients vs 0.3% of EES-treated patients between 3 to 5 years (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.07-2.70) (P for interaction = .03). These results were consistent by spline analysis and after multiple imputation and multivariable analysis. Conclusions and Relevance: The period of excess risk for the first-generation Absorb BVS ends at 3 years. These data provide mechanistic insights into the timing of adverse events after BVS and identify the hurdles to be overcome for bioresorbable technology to be accepted as a valid alternative for patients with coronary artery disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Effects of blood pressure reduction in persons with grade 1 hypertension are unclear. PURPOSE: To investigate whether pharmacologic blood pressure reduction prevents cardiovascular events and deaths in persons with grade 1 hypertension. DATA SOURCES: Trials included in the BPLTTC (Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration) and trials identified from a previous review and electronic database searches. STUDY SELECTION: Patients without cardiovascular disease with blood pressures in the grade 1 hypertension range (140 to 159/90 to 99 mm Hg) who were randomly assigned to an active (antihypertensive drug or more intensive regimen) or control (placebo or less intensive regimen) blood pressure-lowering regimen. DATA EXTRACTION: Individual-patient data from BPLTTC trials and aggregate data from other trials were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed for all trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Individual-patient data involved 10 comparisons from trials where most patients had diabetes, and aggregate data involved 3 comparisons from trials of patients without diabetes. The average blood pressure reduction was about 3.6/2.4 mm Hg. Over 5 years, odds ratios were 0.86 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.01) for total cardiovascular events, 0.72 (CI, 0.55 to 0.94) for strokes, 0.91 (CI, 0.74 to 1.12) for coronary events, 0.80 (CI, 0.57 to 1.12) for heart failure, 0.75 (CI, 0.57 to 0.98) for cardiovascular deaths, and 0.78 (CI, 0.67 to 0.92) for total deaths. Results were similar in secondary analyses. Withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects was more common in the active groups. LIMITATION: Blood pressure reductions and numbers of events were small. CONCLUSION: Blood pressure-lowering therapy is likely to prevent stroke and death in patients with uncomplicated grade 1 hypertension.

AB  - CONTEXT: Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 has shown promise in managing colic, but conflicting study results have prevented a consensus on whether it is truly effective. OBJECTIVE: Through an individual participant data meta-analysis, we sought to definitively determine if L reuteri DSM17938 effectively reduces crying and/or fussing time in infants with colic and whether effects vary by feeding type. DATA SOURCES: We searched online databases (PubMed, Medline, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Cochrane), e-abstracts, and clinical trial registries. STUDY SELECTION: These were double-blind randomized controlled trials (published by June 2017) of L reuteri DSM17398 versus a placebo, delivered orally to infants with colic, with outcomes of infant crying and/or fussing duration and treatment success at 21 days. DATA EXTRACTION: We collected individual participant raw data from included studies modeled simultaneously in multilevel generalized linear mixed-effects regression models. RESULTS: Four double-blind trials involving 345 infants with colic (174 probiotic and 171 placebo) were included. The probiotic group averaged less crying and/or fussing time than the placebo group at all time points (day 21 adjusted mean difference in change from baseline [minutes] -25.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): -47.3 to -3.5]). The probiotic group was almost twice as likely as the placebo group to experience treatment success at all time points (day 21 adjusted incidence ratio 1.7 [95% CI: 1.4 to 2.2]). Intervention effects were dramatic in breastfed infants (number needed to treat for day 21 success 2.6 [95% CI: 2.0 to 3.6]) but were insignificant in formula-fed infants. LIMITATIONS: There were insufficient data to make conclusions for formula-fed infants with colic. CONCLUSIONS: L reuteri DSM17938 is effective and can be recommended for breastfed infants with colic. Its role in formula-fed infants with colic needs further research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensified antimicrobial treatment with higher rifampicin doses may improve outcome of tuberculous meningitis, but the desirable exposure and necessary dose are unknown. Our objective was to characterize the relationship between rifampicin exposures and mortality in order to identify optimal dosing for tuberculous meningitis. METHODS: An individual patient meta-analysis was performed on data from three Indonesian randomized controlled phase II trials comparing oral rifampicin 450mg (~10mg/kg) to intensified regimens including 750-1350mg orally, or a 600mg intravenous infusion. Pharmacokinetic data from plasma and CSF was analyzed with nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Six-month survival was described with parametric time-to-event models. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analyses included 133 individuals (1150 concentration measurements, 170 from CSF). The final model featured two disposition-compartments, saturable clearance and autoinduction. Rifampicin CSF concentrations were described by a partition coefficient (5.5% [95%CI 4.4-6.4]) and half-life for distribution plasma to CSF (2.1 h [1.3-2.9]). Higher CSF protein concentration increased the partition coefficient. Survival of 148 individuals (58 died, 15 drop-outs) was well described by an exponentially declining hazard, with lower age, higher baseline Glasgow Coma Scale score and higher individual rifampicin plasma exposure reducing the hazard. Simulations predicted an increase in 6-month survival from ~50% to ~70% upon increasing the oral rifampicin dose from 10 to 30mg/kg, and that higher doses would further increase survival. CONCLUSIONS: Higher rifampicin exposure substantially decreased the risk of death, and the maximal effect was not reached within the studied range. We suggest a rifampicin dose of at least 30mg/kg to be investigated in phase III clinical trials.

AB  - Background: Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the causal role of vitamin D on noncommunicable disease outcomes is inconclusive. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are beneficial or harmful effects of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) supplementation according to subgroups of remeasured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] on cardiovascular and glucometabolic surrogate markers with the use of individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of RCTs. Design: Twelve RCTs (16 wk to 1 y of follow-up) were included. For standardization, 25(OH)D concentrations for all participants (n = 2994) at baseline and postintervention were re-measured in bio-banked serum samples with the use of a certified liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method traceable to a reference measurement procedure. IPD meta-analyses were performed according to subgroups of remeasured 25(OH)D. Main outcomes were blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes were LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol and triglycerides; parathyroid hormone (PTH); fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide; and 2-h glucose. In secondary analyses, other potential effect modifiers were studied. Results: Remeasurement of 25(OH)D resulted in a lower mean 25(OH)D concentration in 10 of 12 RCTs. Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the main outcomes of blood pressure and HbA1c. Supplementation resulted in 10-20% lower PTH concentrations, irrespective of the 25(OH)D subgroups. The subgroup analyses according to achieved 25(OH)D concentrations showed a significant decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentrations after vitamin D supplementation in 25(OH)D subgroups with <75, <100, and <125 nmol of -0.10 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.20, -0.00 mmol/L), -0.10 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.18, -0.02 mmol/L), and -0.07 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.14, -0.00 mmol/L), respectively. Patient features that modified the treatment effect could not be identified. Conclusions: For the main outcomes of blood pressure and HbA1c, the data support no benefit for vitamin D supplementation. For the secondary outcomes, in addition to its effect on PTH, we observed indications for a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation only on LDL cholesterol, which warrants further investigation. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02551835.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefits of endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm remain controversial, without any strong evidence about advantages in specific subgroups. METHODS: An individual-patient data meta-analysis of three recent randomized trials of endovascular versus open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm was conducted according to a prespecified analysis plan, reporting on results to 90 days after the index event. RESULTS: The trials included a total of 836 patients. The mortality rate across the three trials was 31.3 per cent for patients randomized to endovascular repair/strategy and 34.0 per cent for those randomized to open repair at 30 days (pooled odds ratio 0.88, 95 per cent c.i. 0.66 to 1.18), and 34.3 and 38.0 per cent respectively at 90 days (pooled odds ratio 0.85, 0.64 to 1.13). There was no evidence of significant heterogeneity in the odds ratios between trials. Mean(s.d.) aneurysm diameter was 8.2(1.9) cm and the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 34.8 per cent. There was no significant effect modification with age or Hardman index, but there was indication of an early benefit from an endovascular strategy for women. Discharge from the primary hospital was faster after endovascular repair (hazard ratio 1.24, 95 per cent c.i. 1.04 to 1.47). For open repair, 30-day mortality diminished with increasing aneurysm neck length (adjusted odds ratio 0.69 (95 per cent c.i. 0.53 to 0.89) per 15 mm), but aortic diameter was not associated with mortality for either type of repair. CONCLUSION: Survival to 90 days following an endovascular or open repair strategy is similar for all patients and for the restricted population anatomically suitable for endovascular repair. Women may benefit more from an endovascular strategy than men and patients are, on average, discharged sooner after endovascular repair.

AB  - CONTEXT: The European Association of Urology non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) guidelines recommend that all low- and intermediate-risk patients receive a single immediate instillation of chemotherapy after transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), but its use remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To identify which NMIBC patients benefit from a single immediate instillation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing the efficacy of a single instillation after TURB with TURB alone in NMIBC patients was carried out. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 13 eligible studies were identified. IPD were obtained for 11 studies randomizing 2278 eligible patients, 1161 to TURB and 1117 to a single instillation of epirubicin, mitomycin C, pirarubicin, or thiotepa. A total of 1128 recurrences, 108 progressions, and 460 deaths (59 due to bladder cancer [BCa]) occurred. A single instillation reduced the risk of recurrence by 35% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.74; p<0.001) and the 5-yr recurrence rate from 58.8% to 44.8%. The instillation did not reduce recurrences in patients with a prior recurrence rate of more than one recurrence per year or in patients with an European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recurrence score >/=5. The instillation did not prolong either the time to progression or death from BCa, but it resulted in an increase in the overall risk of death (HR: 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.51; p=0.015; 5-yr death rates 12.0% vs 11.2%), with the difference appearing in patients with an EORTC recurrence score >/=5. CONCLUSIONS: A single immediate instillation reduced the risk of recurrence, except in patients with a prior recurrence rate of more than one recurrence per year or an EORTC recurrence score >/=5. It does not prolong either time to progression or death from BCa. The instillation may be associated with an increase in the risk of death in patients at high risk of recurrence in whom the instillation is not effective or recommended. PATIENT SUMMARY: A single instillation of chemotherapy immediately after resection reduces the risk of recurrence in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer; however, it should not be given to patients at high risk of recurrence due to its lack of efficacy in this subgroup.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform an individual participant data meta-analysis using randomized trials and propensity-score matched (PSM) studies which compared laparoscopic versus open hepatectomy for patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). BACKGROUND: Randomized trials and PSM studies constitute the highest level of evidence in addressing the long-term oncologic efficacy of laparoscopic versus open resection for CLM. However, individual studies are limited by the reporting of overall survival in ways not amenable to traditional methods of meta-analysis, and violation of the proportional hazards assumption. METHODS: Survival information of individual patients was reconstructed from the published Kaplan-Meier curves with the aid of a computer vision program. Frequentist and Bayesian survival models (taking into account random-effects and nonproportional hazards) were fitted to compare overall survival of patients who underwent laparoscopic versus open surgery. To handle long plateaus in the tails of survival curves, we also exploited "cure models" to estimate the fraction of patients effectively "cured" of disease. RESULTS: Individual patient data from 2 randomized trials and 13 PSM studies involving 3148 participants were reconstructed. Laparoscopic resection was associated with a lower hazard rate of death (stratified hazard ratio = 0.853, 95% confidence interval: 0.754-0.965, P = 0.0114), and there was evidence of time-varying effects (P = 0.0324) in which the magnitude of hazard ratios increased over time. The fractions of long-term cancer survivors were estimated to be 47.4% and 18.0% in the laparoscopy and open surgery groups, respectively. At 10-year follow-up, the restricted mean survival time was 8.6 months (or 12.1%) longer in the laparoscopy arm (P < 0.0001). In a subgroup analysis, elderly patients (>/=65 years old) treated with laparoscopy experienced longer 3-year average life expectancy (+6.2%, P = 0.018), and those who live past the 5-year milestone (46.1%) seem to be cured of disease. CONCLUSIONS: This patient-level meta-analysis of high-quality studies demonstrated an unexpected survival benefit in favor of laparoscopic over open resection for CLM in the long-term. From a conservative viewpoint, these results can be interpreted to indicate that laparoscopy is at least not inferior to the standard open approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials of adults hospitalized with pneumonia outcomes research team (PORT) risk class 3-4 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) receiving ceftaroline fosamil versus ceftriaxone. METHODS: Three Phase III trials (clinicaltrials.gov registration numbers NCT00621504, NCT00509106 and NCT01371838) including 1916 hospitalized patients with CAP randomized 1:1 to empirical ceftaroline fosamil (600 mg every 12 h) or ceftriaxone (1-2 g every 24 h) for 5-7 days were included in the meta-analysis. Primary outcome was clinical response at the test-of-cure visit (8-15 days after end of treatment) in the PORT risk class 3-4 modified ITT (MITT) and clinically evaluable (CE) populations. Data were tested for heterogeneity (chi(2) test) and, if not significant, results were pooled and OR and 95% CI constructed. A logistic regression analysis assessed factors impacting cure rate and treatment interactions. RESULTS: Clinical cure rates in each trial consistently favoured ceftaroline fosamil versus ceftriaxone, with no evidence of heterogeneity. In the meta-analysis, ceftaroline fosamil was superior to ceftriaxone in the MITT (OR: 1.66; 95% CI 1.34, 2.06; P < 0.001) and CE (OR: 1.65; 95% CI 1.26, 2.16; P < 0.001) populations. Results were consistent across various patient- and disease-related factors including patients' age and PORT score. Prior antimicrobial use within 96 h of starting study treatment was associated with diminished differences in cure rates between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline fosamil was superior to ceftriaxone for empirical treatment of adults hospitalized with CAP. Receipt of prior antimicrobial therapy appeared to diminish the observed treatment effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and may be associated with poor outcomes. The magnitude of the association between pulmonary hypertension and mortality is uncertain due to the small size and variable findings of observational studies. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies using subgroup analyses and metaregression. SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with ESRD or earlier stages of CKD. SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: Observational studies reporting clinical outcomes in patients with co-existing pulmonary hypertension and CKD or ESRD identified using a systematic search of PubMed and Embase. PREDICTOR: Pulmonary hypertension diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography. OUTCOMES: All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events. RESULTS: 16 studies, with 7,112 patients with an overall pulmonary hypertension prevalence of 23%, were included. Pulmonary hypertension was associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality among patients with CKD (relative risk [RR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.17-1.76), with ESRD receiving maintenance dialysis (RR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.91-2.83), and with a functioning kidney transplant (RR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.35-3.20). Pulmonary hypertension was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events in patients with CKD (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.07-2.60) and ESRD receiving dialysis (RR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.76-3.08). There was an association between pulmonary hypertension and increased risk for cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD or ESRD (RR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.53-3.15). LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity of included studies, possibility of residual confounding, unavailability of individual patient-level data, and possibility of outcome reporting bias. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension is associated with a substantially increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD and ESRD. Risk is higher in patients with ESRD receiving dialysis compared with patients with CKD stages 1 to 5. Understanding the effect of interventions to lower pulmonary artery pressure on the survival of these patents awaits their evaluation in randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Consumption of live bacteria as probiotic supplements is increasing. There is, however, a lack of information on the safety of ingested probiotics. The main objective of this study was to investigate the adverse events (AEs) of specific probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) alone or LGG in combination with L. rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium freudenreichii JS, Bifidobacterium lactis BB12, or Bifidobacterium breve 99) studied in six of our study groups' clinical trials, by analysing individual participant data. A secondary objective was to study AEs associated with the consumed probiotic species and mixtures in three specific categories; 'gastrointestinal disorders', 'respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders' and 'infections and infestations'. Six randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies by our study group were included in this AE analysis (study population n=1,909). All AE data were classified according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. From the 26 CTCAE System Organ Classes, we identified AEs in 20 classes among 1,909 subjects. Probiotic ingestion did not result in statistically significant differences in AEs in different groups, when compared to placebo. A subgroup analysis of gastrointestinal, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, infections and infestations, found no differences between the intervention groups or for different probiotic combinations (risk ratio (RR) = 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.02, P=0.30; RR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.01, P=0.35; RR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.93-1.06, P=0.62, respectively). As a conclusion, ingestion of probiotic supplementations containing LGG alone, or LGG in combination with L. rhamnosus Lc705, P. freudenreichii JS, B. breve 99, or B. lactis BB12 did not seem to cause AEs in young and elderly subjects in this analysis.

AB  - Purpose Radiotherapy reduces the absolute risk of breast cancer mortality by a few percentage points in suitable women but can cause a second cancer or heart disease decades later. We estimated the absolute long-term risks of modern breast cancer radiotherapy. Methods First, a systematic literature review was performed of lung and heart doses in breast cancer regimens published during 2010 to 2015. Second, individual patient data meta-analyses of 40,781 women randomly assigned to breast cancer radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy in 75 trials yielded rate ratios (RRs) for second primary cancers and cause-specific mortality and excess RRs (ERRs) per Gy for incident lung cancer and cardiac mortality. Smoking status was unavailable. Third, the lung or heart ERRs per Gy in the trials and the 2010 to 2015 doses were combined and applied to current smoker and nonsmoker lung cancer and cardiac mortality rates in population-based data. Results Average doses from 647 regimens published during 2010 to 2015 were 5.7 Gy for whole lung and 4.4 Gy for whole heart. The median year of irradiation was 2010 (interquartile range [IQR], 2008 to 2011). Meta-analyses yielded lung cancer incidence >/= 10 years after radiotherapy RR of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.48 to 2.98; P < .001) on the basis of 134 cancers, indicating 0.11 (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.20) ERR per Gy whole-lung dose. For cardiac mortality, RR was 1.30 (95% CI, 1.15 to 1.46; P < .001) on the basis of 1,253 cardiac deaths. Detailed analyses indicated 0.04 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.06) ERR per Gy whole-heart dose. Estimated absolute risks from modern radiotherapy were as follows: lung cancer, approximately 4% for long-term continuing smokers and 0.3% for nonsmokers; and cardiac mortality, approximately 1% for smokers and 0.3% for nonsmokers. Conclusion For long-term smokers, the absolute risks of modern radiotherapy may outweigh the benefits, yet for most nonsmokers (and ex-smokers), the benefits of radiotherapy far outweigh the risks. Hence, smoking can determine the net effect of radiotherapy on mortality, but smoking cessation substantially reduces radiotherapy risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous systematic reviews have indicated that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) for patients with heart failure (HF) has a beneficial effect on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and exercise capacity. However, there is uncertainty regarding potential differential effects of ExCR across HF patient subgroups. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to undertake an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to: 1) assess the impact of ExCR on HRQoL and exercise capacity in patients with HF; and 2) investigate differential effects of ExCR according to a range of patient characteristics: age, sex, ethnicity, New York Heart Association functional class, ischemic etiology, ejection fraction, and exercise capacity. METHODS: A single dataset was produced, comprising randomized trials where ExCR (delivered for 3 weeks or more) was compared with a no exercise control group. Each trial provided IPD on HRQoL or exercise capacity (or both), with follow-up of 6 months or more. One- and 2-stage meta-analysis models were used to investigate the effect of ExCR overall and the interactions between ExCR and participant characteristics. RESULTS: IPD was obtained from 13 trials for 3,990 patients, predominantly (97%) with reduced ejection fraction HF. Compared with the control group, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of ExCR for HRQoL and exercise capacity. At 12-month follow-up, improvements were seen in 6-min walk test (mean 21.0 m; 95% confidence interval: 1.57 to 40.4 m; p = 0.034) and Minnesota Living With HF score (mean improvement 5.9; 95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 10.9; p = 0.018). No consistent evidence was found of differential intervention effects across patient subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: These results, based on an IPD meta-analysis of randomized trials, confirm the benefit of ExCR on HRQoL and exercise capacity and support the Class I recommendation of current international clinical guidelines that ExCR should be offered to all HF patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspirin is of moderate overall benefit for patients with acute disabling ischemic stroke. It is unclear whether functional outcome could be improved after stroke by targeting aspirin to patients with a high risk of recurrent thrombosis or a low risk of haemorrhage. AIMS: We aimed to determine whether patients at higher risk of thrombotic events or poor functional outcome, or lower risk of major haemorrhage had a greater absolute risk reduction of poor functional outcome with aspirin than the average patient. METHODS: We used data on individual ischemic stroke patients from three large trials of aspirin vs. placebo in acute ischemic stroke: the first International Stroke Trial (n = 18,372), the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial (n = 20,172) and the Multicentre Acute Stroke Trial (n = 622). We developed and evaluated clinical prediction models for the following: early thrombotic events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism); early haemorrhagic events (significant intracranial haemorrhage, major extracranial haemorrhage, or haemorrhagic transformation of an infarct); and late poor functional outcome. We calculated the absolute risk reduction of poor functional outcome (death or dependence) at final follow-up in: quartiles of early thrombotic risk; quartiles of early haemorrhagic risk; and deciles of poor functional outcome risk. RESULTS: Ischemic stroke patients who were older, had lower blood pressure, computerized tomography evidence of infarct or more severe deficits due to stroke had increased risk of thrombotic and haemorrhagic events and poor functional outcome. Prediction models built with all baseline variables (including onset to treatment time) discriminated weakly between patients with and without recurrent thrombotic events (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.56, 95% CI:0.53-0.59) and haemorrhagic events (0.57, 0.52-0.64), though well between patients with and without poor functional outcome (0.77, 0.76-0.78) in the International Stroke Trial. We found no evidence that the net benefit of aspirin increased with increasing risk of thrombosis, haemorrhage or poor functional outcome in all three trials. CONCLUSIONS: Using simple clinical variables to target aspirin to patients after acute disabling stroke by risk of thrombosis, haemorrhage or poor functional outcome does not lead to greater net clinical benefit. We suggest future risk stratification schemes include new risk factors for thrombosis and intracranial haemorrhage.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increasing protein or amino acid intake has been promoted as a promising strategy to increase muscle mass and strength in elderly people, however, long-term intervention studies show inconsistent findings. Therefore, we aim to determine the impact of protein or amino acid supplementation compared to placebo on muscle mass and strength in older adults by combining the results from published trials in a meta-analysis and pooled individual participant data analysis. DESIGN: We searched Medline and Cochrane databases and performed a meta-analysis on eight available trials on the effect of protein or amino acid supplementation on muscle mass and strength in older adults. Furthermore, we pooled individual data of six of these randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials. The main outcomes were change in lean body mass and change in muscle strength for both the meta-analysis and the pooled analysis. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of eight studies (n=557) showed no significant positive effects of protein or amino acid supplementation on lean body mass (mean difference: 0.014 kg: 95% CI -0.152; 0.18), leg press strength (mean difference: 2.26 kg: 95% CI -0.56; 5.08), leg extension strength (mean difference: 0.75 kg: 95% CI: -1.96, 3.47) or handgrip strength (mean difference: -0.002 kg: 95% CI -0.182; 0.179). Likewise, the pooled analysis showed no significant difference between protein and placebo treatment on lean body mass (n=412: p=0.78), leg press strength (n=121: p=0.50), leg extension strength (n=121: p=0.16) and handgrip strength (n=318: p=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no evidence to suggest that protein or amino acid supplementation without concomitant nutritional or exercise interventions increases muscle mass or strength in predominantly healthy elderly people.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy, safety, and tolerability of an oral enzyme combination (OEC) containing proteolytic enzymes and bioflavonoid vs diclofenac (DIC), a nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an individual patient-level pooled reanalysis of patient-reported data from prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies in adult patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis of the knee treated for at least 3 weeks with OEC or DIC. Appropriate trials were identified with a systemic literature and database search. Data were extracted from the original case-report forms and reanalyzed by a blinded evaluation committee. The primary end point was the improvement of the Lequesne algofunctional index (LAFI) score at study end vs baseline. Secondary end points addressed LAFI response rates, treatment-related pain-intensity changes, adverse events, and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Six trials were identified that enrolled in total 774 patients, of whom 759 had post-baseline data for safety analysis, 697 (n=348/349 with OEC/DIC) for intent to treat, 524 for per protocol efficacy analysis, and 500 for laboratory evaluation. LAFI scores - the primary efficacy end point - decreased comparably with both treatments and improved with both treatments significantly vs baseline (OEC 12.6+/-2.4 to 9.1+/-3.9, DIC 12.7+/-2.4 to 9.1+/-4.2, effect size 0.9/0.88; P<0.001 for each). In parallel, movement-related 11-point numeric rating-scale pain intensity improved significantly (P<0.001) and comparably with both treatments from baseline (6.4+/-1.9/6.6+/-1.8) to study end (3.8+/-2.7/3.9+/-2.5). Overall, 55/81 OEC/DIC patients of the safety-analysis population (14.7%/21.1%, P=0.022) reported 90/133 treatment-emergent adverse events, followed by premature treatment discontinuations in 22/39 patients (5.9%/10.2%, P=0.030). Changes in laboratory parameters were significantly less with OEC vs DIC: on average 18.8% vs 86.3% of patients presented a decrease with respect to hemoglobin, hematocrit, or erythrocyte count (P<0.001), and 28.2% vs 72.6% showed an increase in AST, ALT, or GGT (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: When compared with DIC, OEC showed comparable efficacy and a superior tolerability/safety profile associated with a significantly lower risk of treatment-emergent adverse events, related study discontinuations, and changes in laboratory parameters.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether genetic subgroups in recent amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) trials responded to treatment with lithium carbonate, but that the treatment effect was lost in a large cohort of nonresponders. METHODS: Individual participant data were obtained from 3 randomized trials investigating the efficacy of lithium carbonate. We matched clinical data with data regarding the UNC13A and C9orf72 genotype. Our primary outcome was survival at 12 months. On an exploratory basis, we assessed whether the effect of lithium depended on the genotype. RESULTS: Clinical data were available for 518 of the 606 participants. Overall, treatment with lithium carbonate did not improve 12-month survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-1.4; p = 0.96). Both the UNC13A and C9orf72 genotype were independent predictors of survival (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.3; p = 0.006 and HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.2; p = 0.032, respectively). The effect of lithium was different for UNC13A carriers (p = 0.027), but not for C9orf72 carriers (p = 0.22). The 12-month survival probability for UNC13A carriers treated with lithium carbonate improved from 40.1% (95% CI 23.2-69.1) to 69.7% (95% CI 50.4-96.3). CONCLUSIONS: This study incorporated genetic data into past ALS trials to determine treatment effects in a genetic post hoc analysis. Our results suggest that we should reorient our strategies toward finding treatments for ALS, start focusing on genotype-targeted treatments, and standardize genotyping in order to optimize randomization and analysis for future clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of intra-articular (IA) glucocorticoids for knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA) in specific subgroups of patients with severe pain and inflammatory signs using individual patient data (IPD) from existing trials. DESIGN: Randomized trials evaluating one or more IA glucocorticoid preparation in patients with knee or hip OA, published from 1995 up to June 2012 were selected from the literature. IPD obtained from original trials included patient and disease characteristics and outcomes measured. The primary outcome was pain severity at short-term follow-up (up to 4 weeks). The subgroup factors assessed included severe pain (>/=70 points, 0-100 scale) and signs of inflammation (dichotomized in present or not) at baseline. Multilevel regression analyses were applied to estimate the magnitude of the effects in the subgroups with the individuals nested within each study. RESULTS: Seven out of 43 published randomized clinical trials (n = 620) were included. Patients with severe baseline pain had a significantly larger reduction in short-term pain, but not in mid- and long-term pain, compared to those with less severe pain at baseline (Mean Difference 13.91; 95% Confidence Interval 1.50-26.31) when receiving IA glucocorticoid injection compared to placebo. No statistical significant interaction effects were found between inflammatory signs and IA glucocorticoid injections compared to placebo and to tidal irrigation at all follow-up points. CONCLUSIONS: This IPD meta-analysis demonstrates that patients with severe knee pain at baseline derive more benefit from IA glucocorticoid injection at short-term follow-up than those with less severe pain at baseline.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity in developed countries. Whether continued tocolysis after 48 hours of rescue tocolysis improves neonatal outcome is unproven. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of maintenance tocolytic therapy with oral nifedipine on the reduction of adverse neonatal outcomes and the prolongation of pregnancy by performing an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for randomised controlled trials of maintenance tocolysis therapy with nifedipine in preterm labour. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected trials including pregnant women between 24 and 36(6/7) weeks of gestation (gestational age, GA) with imminent preterm labour who had not delivered after 48 hours of initial tocolysis, and compared maintenance nifedipine tocolysis with placebo/no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was perinatal mortality. Secondary outcome measures were intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), prolongation of pregnancy, GA at delivery, birthweight, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and number of days on ventilation support. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed. MAIN RESULTS: Six randomised controlled trials were included in this IPDMA, encompassing data from 787 patients (n = 390 for nifedipine; n = 397 for placebo/no treatment). There was no difference between the groups for the incidence of perinatal death (risk ratio, RR 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 0.35-5.33), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) >/= grade II (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.16-2.67), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.50-2.65), infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.51-1.85), and prolongation of pregnancy (hazard ratio, HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.55-1.01). CONCLUSION: Maintenance tocolysis is not associated with improved perinatal outcome and is therefore not recommended for routine practice. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Nifedipine maintenance tocolysis is not associated with improved perinatal outcome or pregnancy prolongation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous preterm birth is an important cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. An increasing body of evidence suggests that uteroplacental ischemia plays an important role in the etiology of spontaneous preterm birth. We aimed to study whether antiplatelet agents reduce the risk of spontaneous preterm birth. DATA SOURCES: We included data from an individual participant data meta-analysis of studies that had evaluated the effect of antiplatelet agents to reduce preeclampsia (Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies Individual Participant Data). METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: The meta-analysis included 31 studies that randomized women to low-dose aspirin-dipyridamole or placebo-no treatment as a primary preventive strategy for preeclampsia. For the current study we analyzed data from 17 trials (28,797 women) that supplied data on type of delivery (spontaneous compared with indicated birth). TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Primary endpoints were spontaneous preterm birth at less than 37 weeks, less than 34 weeks, and less than 28 weeks of gestation. We analyzed outcomes for each trial separately using chi statistics and combined in an individual participant data meta-analysis using a binary logistic regression model. Women assigned to antiplatelet treatment compared with placebo or no treatment had a lower risk of spontaneous preterm birth at less than 37 weeks (relative risk [RR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.996) and less than 34 weeks of gestation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.99). The RR of having a spontaneous preterm birth at less than 37 weeks of gestation was 0.83 (95% CI 0.73-0.95) for women who have had a previous pregnancy and 0.98 (95% CI 0.89-1.09) for women in their first pregnancy. The treatment effect was stable in all other prespecified subgroups. CONCLUSION: Antiplatelet agents reduce spontaneous preterm birth in pregnant women at risk for preeclampsia.

AB  - PURPOSE: Fatigue is a common and potentially disabling symptom in patients with cancer. It can often be effectively reduced by exercise. Yet, effects of exercise interventions might differ across subgroups. We conducted a meta-analysis using individual patient data of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate moderators of exercise intervention effects on cancer-related fatigue. METHODS: We used individual patient data from 31 exercise RCTs worldwide, representing 4,366 patients, of whom 3,846 had complete fatigue data. We performed a one-step individual patient data meta-analysis, using linear mixed-effect models to analyze the effects of exercise interventions on fatigue (z-score) and to identify demographic, clinical, intervention- and exercise-related moderators. Models were adjusted for baseline fatigue and included a random intercept on study level to account for clustering of patients within studies. We identified potential moderators by testing their interaction with group allocation, using a likelihood ratio test. RESULTS: Exercise interventions had statistically significant beneficial effects on fatigue (beta= -0.17 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.22;-0.12]). There was no evidence of moderation by demographic or clinical characteristics. Supervised exercise interventions had significantly larger effects on fatigue than unsupervised exercise interventions (betadifference= -0.18 [95%CI -0.28;-0.08]). Supervised interventions with a duration </=12 weeks showed larger effects on fatigue (beta= -0.29 [95% CI -0.39;-0.20]) than supervised interventions with a longer duration. Conclusions - In this individual patient data meta-analysis, we found statistically significant beneficial effects of exercise interventions on fatigue, irrespective of demographic and clinical characteristics. These findings support a role for exercise, preferably supervised exercise interventions, in clinical practice. Reasons for differential effects in duration require further exploration.PROSPERO, CRD42013003805.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for AOM varies from 56% in the Netherlands to 95% in the USA, Canada and Australia. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 1997 and previously updated in 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to April week 3, 2015), OLDMEDLINE (1958 to 1965), EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2015), Current Contents (1966 to April 2015), CINAHL (2008 to April 2015) and LILACS (2008 to April 2015). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: For the review of antibiotics against placebo, 13 RCTs (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries were eligible and had generally low risk of bias. The combined results of the trials revealed that by 24 hours from the start of treatment, 60% of the children had recovered whether or not they had placebo or antibiotics. Pain was not reduced by antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20). A quarter fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91; NNTB 16) and two-thirds fewer had pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7) compared with placebo. Antibiotics did reduce the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; NNTB 11), at six to eight weeks (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; NNTB 16) and the number of children with tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11) compared with placebo. However, antibiotics neither reduced the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at three months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24) nor the number of children with late AOM recurrences (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10) when compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo. Adverse events (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) occurred more often in children taking antibiotics (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.59; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14). Funnel plots do not suggest publication bias. Individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of included trials found antibiotics to be most beneficial in children aged less than two years with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea.For the review of immediate antibiotics against expectant observation, five trials (1149 children) from high-income countries were eligible and had low to moderate risk of bias. Four trials (1007 children) reported outcome data that could be used for this review. From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis of pain at three to seven days. No difference in pain was detectable at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12). One trial (247 children) reported data on pain at 11 to 14 days. Immediate antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in the number of children with pain (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10) compared with expectant observation. Additionally, no differences in the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks, tympanic membrane perforations and AOM recurrence were observed between groups. No serious complications occurred in either the antibiotic or the expectant observation group. Immediate antibiotics were associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash compared with expectant observation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36; NNTH 9).Results from an individual patient data meta-analysis including data from six high-quality trials (1643 children) that were also included as individual trials in our review showed that antibiotics seem to be most beneficial in children younger than two years of age with bilateral AOM (NNTB 4) and in children with both AOM and otorrhoea (NNTB 3). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals that antibiotics have no early effect on pain, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks and at six to eight weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. Therefore clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics. Antibiotics are most useful in children under two years of age with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified.

AB  - Despite wide use in clinical practice, acupuncture remains a controversial treatment for chronic pain. Our objective was to update an individual patient data meta-analysis to determine the effect size of acupuncture for 4 chronic pain conditions. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials randomized trials published up until December 31, 2015. We included randomized trials of acupuncture needling versus either sham acupuncture or no acupuncture control for nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis, chronic headache, or shoulder pain. Trials were only included if allocation concealment was unambiguously determined to be adequate. Raw data were obtained from study authors and entered into an individual patient data meta-analysis. The main outcome measures were pain and function. An additional 13 trials were identified, with data received for a total of 20,827 patients from 39 trials. Acupuncture was superior to sham as well as no acupuncture control for each pain condition (all P < .001) with differences between groups close to .5 SDs compared with no acupuncture control and close to .2 SDs compared with sham. We also found clear evidence that the effects of acupuncture persist over time with only a small decrease, approximately 15%, in treatment effect at 1 year. In secondary analyses, we found no obvious association between trial outcome and characteristics of acupuncture treatment, but effect sizes of acupuncture were associated with the type of control group, with smaller effects sizes for sham controlled trials that used a penetrating needle for sham, and for trials that had high intensity of intervention in the control arm. We conclude that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain, with treatment effects persisting over time. Although factors in addition to the specific effects of needling at correct acupuncture point locations are important contributors to the treatment effect, decreases in pain after acupuncture cannot be explained solely in terms of placebo effects. Variations in the effect size of acupuncture in different trials are driven predominantly by differences in treatments received by the control group rather than by differences in the characteristics of acupuncture treatment. PERSPECTIVE: Acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal, headache, and osteoarthritis pain. Treatment effects of acupuncture persist over time and cannot be explained solely in terms of placebo effects. Referral for a course of acupuncture treatment is a reasonable option for a patient with chronic pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine whether online family problem-solving treatment (OFPST) is more effective in improving behavioral outcomes after pediatric traumatic brain injury with increasing time since injury. METHODS: This was an individual participant data meta-analysis of outcome data from 5 randomized controlled trials of OFPST conducted between 2003 and 2016. We included 359 children ages 5 to 18 years who were hospitalized for moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury 1 to 24 months earlier. Outcomes, assessed pre- and posttreatment, included parent-reported measures of externalizing, internalizing, and executive function behaviors and social competence. RESULTS: Participants included 231 boys and 128 girls with an average age at injury of 13.6 years. Time since injury and age at injury moderated OFPST efficacy. For earlier ages and short time since injury, control participants demonstrated better externalizing problem scores than those receiving OFPST (Cohen's d = 0.44; P = .008; n = 295), whereas at older ages and longer time since injury, children receiving OFPST had better scores (Cohen's d = -0.60; P = .002). Children receiving OFPST were rated as having better executive functioning relative to control participants at a later age at injury, with greater effects seen at longer (Cohen's d = -0.66; P = .009; n = 298) than shorter (Cohen's d = -0. 28; P = .028) time since injury. CONCLUSIONS: OFPST may be more beneficial for older children and when begun after the initial months postinjury. With these findings, we shed light on the optimal application of family problem-solving treatments within the first 2 years after injury.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Results from two long-term studies (ROADMAP and ORIENT) indicated a numerical imbalance in the number of cardiovascular deaths between the olmesartan medoxomil (OM) and placebo groups. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct an individual patient data meta-analysis to provide more complete information regarding OM-associated cardiovascular risks and/or benefits. METHODS: We created an integrated database based on 191 clinical trials from the OM development program. Events were identified and adjudicated by an independent, blinded clinical events committee. The incidence of major cardiovascular events and total mortality for OM versus placebo/active control were evaluated, and the effect of OM on cardiovascular mortality (main endpoint of interest) and morbidity was calculated using a two-stage approach (Tian method). RESULTS: A total of 46 studies (~27,000 patients) met the US FDA-specified inclusion criteria (phase II-IV randomized, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies [OM-based monotherapy or combination, double-blind period >/=28 days] and adult patients). The incidence of known adjudicated endpoints in the analysis of all studies combined was low among OM (0.11-0.53 %) and placebo/active control (0.08-0.76 %) groups. For cardiovascular mortality, the estimated risk difference (OM vs. control) was 0.00070 (95 % confidence interval [CI] -0.0011 to 0.0024; p = 0.60); the risk difference for each endpoint was <1/1000, with no statistically significant difference between groups. Results were similar with and without ROADMAP and ORIENT. DISCUSSION: The results from this meta-analysis did not show a clinically meaningful or statistically significant difference in cardiovascular risk between OM and the placebo/active control groups, and thus did not corroborate the numerical imbalance observed in ROADMAP and ORIENT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most frequent cause of anovulatory infertility. In women with PCOS, effective ovulation induction serves as an important first-line treatment for anovulatory infertility. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis is considered as the gold standard for evidence synthesis which provides accurate assessments of outcomes from primary randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and allows additional analyses for time-to-event outcomes. It also facilitates treatment-covariate interaction analyses and therefore offers an opportunity for personalised medicine. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different ovulation induction agents, in particular letrozole alone and clomiphene citrate (CC) plus metformin, as compared to CC alone, as the first-line choice for ovulation induction in women with PCOS and infertility, and to explore interactions between treatment and participant-level baseline characteristics. SEARCH METHODS: We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 20 December 2018. We included RCTs comparing the following interventions with each other or placebo/no treatment in women with PCOS and infertility: CC, metformin, CC plus metformin, letrozole, gonadotrophin and tamoxifen. We excluded studies on treatment-resistant women. The primary outcome was live birth. We contacted the investigators of eligible RCTs to share the IPD and performed IPD meta-analyses. We assessed the risk of bias by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs. OUTCOMES: IPD of 20 RCTs including 3962 women with PCOS were obtained. Six RCTs compared letrozole and CC in 1284 women. Compared with CC, letrozole improved live birth rates (3 RCTs, 1043 women, risk ratio [RR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.75, moderate-certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy rates (6 RCTs, 1284 women, RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.23-1.70, moderate-certainty evidence) and reduced time-to-pregnancy (6 RCTs, 1235 women, hazard ratio [HR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.38-2.15, moderate-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive interaction between baseline serum total testosterone levels and treatment effects on live birth (interaction RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.65). Eight RCTs compared CC plus metformin to CC alone in 1039 women. Compared with CC alone, CC plus metformin might improve clinical pregnancy rates (8 RCTs, 1039 women, RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.39, low-certainty evidence) and might reduce time-to-pregnancy (7 RCTs, 898 women, HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00-1.57, low-certainty evidence), but there was insufficient evidence of a difference on live birth rates (5 RCTs, 907 women, RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87-1.35, low-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive interaction between baseline insulin levels and treatment effects on live birth in the comparison between CC plus metformin and CC (interaction RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06). WIDER IMPLICATIONS: In women with PCOS, letrozole improves live birth and clinical pregnancy rates and reduces time-to-pregnancy compared to CC and therefore can be recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for women with PCOS and infertility. CC plus metformin may increase clinical pregnancy and may reduce time-to-pregnancy compared to CC alone, while there is insufficient evidence of a difference on live birth. Treatment effects of letrozole are influenced by baseline serum levels of total testosterone, while those of CC plus metformin are affected by baseline serum levels of insulin. These interactions between treatments and biomarkers on hyperandrogenaemia and insulin resistance provide further insights into a personalised approach for the management of anovulatory infertility related to PCOS.

AB  - Background: There is no consensus whether higher intensity dose renal replacement therapy (RRT) compared with standard intensity RRT has survival benefit and achieves better renal recovery in acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods: In an individual patient data meta-analysis, we merged individual patient data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing high with standard intensity RRT in intensive care unit patients with severe AKI. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcome was renal recovery assessed as the proportion of patients who were RRT dependent at key trial endpoints and by time to the end of RRT dependence. Results: Of the eight prospective RCTs assessing different RRT intensities, seven contributed individual patient data (n = 3682) to the analysis. Mortality was similar between the two groups at 28 days [769/1884 (40.8%) and 744/1798 (41.4%), respectively; P = 0.40] after randomization. However, more participants assigned to higher intensity therapy remained RRT dependent at the most common key study point of 28 days [e.g. 292/983 (29.7%) versus 235/943 (24.9%); relative risk 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.00-1.33); P = 0.05]. Time to cessation of RRT through 28 days was longer in patients receiving higher intensity RRT (log-rank test P = 0.02) and when continuous renal replacement therapy was used as the initial modality of RRT (log-rank test P = 0.03). Conclusions: In severe AKI patients, higher intensity RRT does not affect mortality but appears to delay renal recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fixed dose combinations of cardiovascular therapy ('polypills') have now been launched in several dozen countries. There is considerable clinical interest in the effects of switching to polypill-based care from typical current treatment regimens, especially if polypills contain components at sub-maximal dosage. METHODS: The SPACE Collaboration includes three trials of polypill based care vs usual care in patients with established CVD or at high calculated risk. Individual patient data for 3140 trial participants were combined. Patients were categorized according to the potency of the statin and the number of BP lowering medications they were taking at baseline. Effects on adherence to anti-platelet medication, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and LDL cholesterol stratified by baseline potency of medication were determined using fixed effects models. RESULTS: Randomisation to the polypill group was associated with improved SBP at 12months, but this improvement varied according to baseline BP regimen: -3.3, -5.9, -2.5 and +1mmHg for patients taking 0, 1, 2 and 3+ BP lowering medications at baseline. For changes in LDL cholesterol at 12months, significant improvements in LDL cholesterol were seen for those taking no statin (-0.21mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.34 to -0.07), less potent statin (-0.16mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.29 to -0.04) and equipotent statins (-0.14mmol/L; 95% CI -0.26 to -0.02) at baseline. CONCLUSION: The adherence benefits of polypills tend to offset the loss of potency from use of individual components with lower dose potency, and to facilitate improvements in multiple risk factors.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Current guidelines recommend treating severe depression with pharmacotherapy. Randomized clinical trials as well as traditional meta-analyses have considerable limitations in testing for moderators of treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic literature search, collect primary data from trials, and analyze baseline depression severity as a moderator of treatment outcomes between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication (ADM). DATA SOURCES: A total of 14902 abstracts were examined from a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials from 1966 to January 1, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials in which CBT and ADM were compared in patients with a DSM-defined depressive disorder were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study authors were asked to provide primary data from their trial. Primary data from 16 of 24 identified trials (67%), with 1700 outpatients (794 from the CBT condition and 906 from the ADM condition), were included. Missing data were imputed with multiple imputation methods. Mixed-effects models adjusting for study-level differences were used to examine baseline depression severity as a moderator of treatment outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seventeen-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS: There was a main effect of ADM over CBT on the HAM-D (beta = -0.88; P = .03) and a nonsignificant trend on the BDI (beta = -1.14; P = .08, statistical test for trend), but no significant differences in response (odds ratio [OR], 1.24; P = .12) or remission (OR, 1.18; P = .22). Mixed-effects models using the HAM-D indicated that baseline depression severity does not moderate reductions in depressive symptoms between CBT and ADM at outcome (beta = 0.00; P = .96). Similar results were seen using the BDI. Baseline depression severity also did not moderate the likelihood of response (OR, 0.99; P = .77) or remission (OR, 1.00; P = .93) between CBT and ADM. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Baseline depression severity did not moderate differences between CBT and ADM on the HAM-D or BDI or in response or remission. This finding cannot be extrapolated to other psychotherapies, to individual ADMs, or to inpatients. However, it offers new and substantial evidence that is of relevance to researchers, physicians and therapists, and patients.

AB  - We examined the role of placebo response in acute mania trials. Specifically, whether placebo response: (1) predicts treatment effect, (2) can be predicted by patient and study characteristics, and (3) can be predicted by a parsimonious model. We performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 10 registration studies (n=1019) for the indication acute manic episode of bipolar disorder. We assessed the effect of 14 determinants on placebo response. Primary outcome measures were mean symptom change score (MCS) on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and response rate (RR), defined as >/= 50% YMRS symptom improvement from baseline to endpoint. The overall placebo response was 8.5 points improvement on the YMRS (=27.9%) with a RR of 32.8%. Placebo response was significantly associated with the overall treatment response. Five determinants significantly (p<0.05) predicted the placebo response. The multivariate prediction model, which consisted of baseline severity, psychotic features at baseline, number of geographic regions, and region, explained 10.4% and 5.5% of the variance in MSC and RR, respectively. Our findings showed that the placebo response in efficacy trials of antipsychotics for acute mania is substantial and an important determinant of treatment effect. Placebo response is influenced by patient characteristics (illness severity and presence of psychotic features) and by study characteristics (study year, number of geographic regions and region). However, the prediction model could only explain the placebo response to a limited extent. Therefore, limiting trials to certain patients in certain geographic regions seems not a viable strategy to improve assay sensitivity.

AB  - Given globalization trends in the conduct of clinical trials, the external validity of trial results across geographic regions is questioned. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of treatment in acute mania in bipolar disorder across regions and to explain potential differences by differences in patient characteristics. We performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 12 registration studies for the indication acute manic episode of bipolar disorder. Patients (n = 3207) were classified into one of three geographic regions: Europe (n = 981), USA (n = 1270), and other regions (n = 956). Primary outcome measures were mean symptom change score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) from baseline to endpoint and responder status (50% improvement form baseline). Effect sizes were significantly smaller in the USA (g = 0.203, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.062-0.344; odds ratio (OR) 1.406, 95% CI 0.998-1.980) than in Europe (g = 0.476, 95% CI 0.200-0.672; OR 2.380, 95% CI 1.682-3.368) or other regions (g = 0.533, 95% CI 0.399-0.667; OR 2.300, 95% CI 1.800-2.941). Regional differences in age, gender, initial severity, body mass index, placebo response, discontinuation rate, and type of compound could not explain the geographic differences in effect. Less severe symptoms at baseline in the US patients did explain some of the difference in responder status between patients in Europe and the USA. These findings suggest that the results of studies involving patients with acute mania cannot be extrapolated across geographic regions. Similar findings have been identified in schizophrenia, contraceptive, and in cardiovascular trials. Therefore, this finding may indicate a more general problem regarding the generalizability of pharmacological trials over geographic regions.

AB  - Patients having an acute manic episode of bipolar disorder often lack insight into their condition. Because little is known about the possible effect of insight on treatment efficacy, we examined whether insight at the start of treatment affects the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment in patients with acute mania. We used individual patient data from 7 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled registration studies of 4 antipsychotics in patients with acute mania (N = 1904). Insight was measured with item 11 of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) at baseline and study endpoint 3 weeks later. Treatment outcome was defined by (a) mean change score, (b) response defined as 50% or more improvement on YMRS, and (c) remission defined as YMRS score less than 8 at study endpoint. We used multilevel mixed effect linear (or logistic) regression analyses of individual patient data to assess the interaction between baseline insight and treatment outcomes. At treatment initiation, 1207 (63.5%) patients had impaired or no insight into their condition. Level of insight significantly modified the efficacy of treatment by mean change score (P = 0.039), response rate (P = 0.033), and remission rate (P = 0.043), with greater improvement in patients with more impaired insight. We therefore recommend that patients experiencing acute mania should be treated immediately and not be delayed until patients regain insight.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomised trials have shown that alteplase improves the odds of a good outcome when delivered within 4.5 h of acute ischaemic stroke. However, alteplase also increases the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage; we aimed to determine the proportional and absolute effects of alteplase on the risks of intracerebral haemorrhage, mortality, and functional impairment in different types of patients. METHODS: We used individual patient data from the Stroke Thrombolysis Trialists' (STT) meta-analysis of randomised trials of alteplase versus placebo (or untreated control) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. We prespecified assessment of three classifications of intracerebral haemorrhage: type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage within 7 days; Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke Monitoring Study's (SITS-MOST) haemorrhage within 24-36 h (type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage with a deterioration of at least 4 points on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]); and fatal intracerebral haemorrhage within 7 days. We used logistic regression, stratified by trial, to model the log odds of intracerebral haemorrhage on allocation to alteplase, treatment delay, age, and stroke severity. We did exploratory analyses to assess mortality after intracerebral haemorrhage and examine the absolute risks of intracerebral haemorrhage in the context of functional outcome at 90-180 days. FINDINGS: Data were available from 6756 participants in the nine trials of intravenous alteplase versus control. Alteplase increased the odds of type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage (occurring in 231 [6.8%] of 3391 patients allocated alteplase vs 44 [1.3%] of 3365 patients allocated control; odds ratio [OR] 5.55 [95% CI 4.01-7.70]; absolute excess 5.5% [4.6-6.4]); of SITS-MOST haemorrhage (124 [3.7%] of 3391 vs 19 [0.6%] of 3365; OR 6.67 [4.11-10.84]; absolute excess 3.1% [2.4-3.8]); and of fatal intracerebral haemorrhage (91 [2.7%] of 3391 vs 13 [0.4%] of 3365; OR 7.14 [3.98-12.79]; absolute excess 2.3% [1.7-2.9]). However defined, the proportional increase in intracerebral haemorrhage was similar irrespective of treatment delay, age, or baseline stroke severity, but the absolute excess risk of intracerebral haemorrhage increased with increasing stroke severity: for SITS-MOST intracerebral haemorrhage the absolute excess risk ranged from 1.5% (0.8-2.6%) for strokes with NIHSS 0-4 to 3.7% (2.1-6.3%) for NIHSS 22 or more (p=0.0101). For patients treated within 4.5 h, the absolute increase in the proportion (6.8% [4.0% to 9.5%]) achieving a modified Rankin Scale of 0 or 1 (excellent outcome) exceeded the absolute increase in risk of fatal intracerebral haemorrhage (2.2% [1.5% to 3.0%]) and the increased risk of any death within 90 days (0.9% [-1.4% to 3.2%]). INTERPRETATION: Among patients given alteplase, the net outcome is predicted both by time to treatment (with faster time increasing the proportion achieving an excellent outcome) and stroke severity (with a more severe stroke increasing the absolute risk of intracerebral haemorrhage). Although, within 4.5 h of stroke, the probability of achieving an excellent outcome with alteplase treatment exceeds the risk of death, early treatment is especially important for patients with severe stroke.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Steroids suppress the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass, but the impact on death at 30 days, myocardial infarction or injury, stroke, renal failure, respiratory failure, new atrial fibrillation, transfusion requirement, infection, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays are uncertain. DESIGN: Patient-level data meta-analysis of 2 randomized trials. SETTING: Eighty-eight cardiac surgical centers in 19 countries. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 11,989 participants, from the Steroids in Cardiac Surgery trial and the Dexamethasone in Cardiac Surgery study, undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to steroid or placebo. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcomes assessed were mortality at 30 days, myocardial infarction or injury, stroke, renal failure, respiratory failure, new atrial fibrillation, transfusion requirement, infection, and length of ICU and hospital stays. There was no significant difference in death at 30 days between the steroid and placebo groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-1.07). Myocardial infarction did not differ significantly (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.93-1.47); however, myocardial injury was higher in the steroid group (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.12-1.40). There were no significant differences for the outcomes of stroke, renal failure, new atrial fibrillation, or transfusion. Steroids significantly reduced respiratory failure (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99), infection (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72-0.89), and length of ICU (p < 0.001) and hospital stays (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: This patient-level meta-analysis does not support the routine use of steroids in cardiac surgery. Steroid administration did not decrease the risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, new atrial fibrillation, or transfusion. Steroids increased the risk of myocardial injury in both the Steroids in Cardiac Surgery and Dexamethasone in Cardiac Surgery trials. Finally, steroids lowered the risk of respiratory failure and infection, and reduced length of ICU and hospital stay.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our previous study-level (aggregate data) meta-analysis suggested that vitamin D supplements may be beneficial for bone density specifically in children with vitamin D deficiency. However, the misclassification of vitamin D status inherent in study-level data means that the results are not definitive and cannot provide an accurate assessment of the size of any effect. Therefore, we propose to undertake an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to determine whether the effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone density in children differs according to baseline vitamin D status, and to specifically estimate the effect of vitamin D in children who are vitamin D deficient. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study has been designed to adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of IPD statement. We will include randomised placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation reporting bone density outcomes at least 6 months after the study commenced in children and adolescents (aged <20 years) without coexistent medical conditions or treatments causing osteoporosis. We will update the search of the original review to cover the period 2009-2017, using the same methods as the original review. Fully anonymised data on all randomised patients will be requested. Outcomes will be femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine and proximal and distal forearm bone mineral density, and total body bone mineral content. A two-stage IPD meta-analysis will be used to examine the effect of baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) on treatment effect for each bone density outcome. Restricted maximum likelihood will be used to estimate the random-effects meta-analysis models, with 95% CI for summary effects. Heterogeneity will be assessed by I(2) and potential publication bias (small-study effects) and availability bias by funnel plots, Egger's test and Peter's test. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval will not be required as the data are to be used for the primary purpose for which they were collected and all original individual studies had ethics approval. Results of the IPD meta-analysis will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017068772.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of serum procalcitonin levels in guiding antibiotic treatment decisions in patients with sepsis remains unclear. This patient-level meta-analysis based on 11 randomized trials investigates the impact of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy on mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with infection, both overall and stratified according to sepsis definition, severity, and type of infection. METHODS: For this meta-analysis focusing on procalcitonin-guided antibiotic management in critically ill patients with sepsis of any type, in February 2018 we updated the database of a previous individual patient data meta-analysis which was limited to patients with respiratory infections only. We used individual patient data from 11 trials that randomly assigned patients to receive antibiotics based on procalcitonin levels (the "procalcitonin-guided" group) or the current standard of care (the "controls"). The primary endpoint was mortality within 30 days. Secondary endpoints were duration of antibiotic treatment and length of stay. RESULTS: Mortality in the 2252 procalcitonin-guided patients was significantly lower compared with the 2230 control group patients (21.1% vs 23.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 0.99; p = 0.03). These effects on mortality persisted in a subgroup of patients meeting the sepsis 3 definition and based on the severity of sepsis (assessed on the basis of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, occurrence of septic shock or renal failure, and need for vasopressor or ventilatory support) and on the type of infection (respiratory, urinary tract, abdominal, skin, or central nervous system), with interaction for each analysis being > 0.05. Procalcitonin guidance also facilitated earlier discontinuation of antibiotics, with a reduction in treatment duration (9.3 vs 10.4 days; adjusted coefficient -1.19 days, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.66; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with infection and sepsis patients results in improved survival and lower antibiotic treatment duration.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To optimally select chronic pain patients for different treatments, as it is of interest to identify patient characteristics that might moderate treatment effect. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of possible moderators on the effect of acupuncture treatment using a large data set. METHODS: We used data from an individual patient data meta-analysis of high-quality randomized trials of acupuncture for chronic headache and migraine, osteoarthritis, and back, neck, and shoulder pain. Using meta-analytic trial-level and patient-level regression analyses, we explored the impact of 5 documented patient characteristics (patients' age at baseline, sex, pain duration, baseline pain severity and baseline psychological distress) on the effect of acupuncture. RESULTS: A total of 39 trials met the inclusion criteria: 25 use sham-acupuncture controls (n = 7097) and 25 non-acupuncture controls (n = 16,041). Of the 5 patient characteristics analyzed, only baseline pain severity was found to potentially moderate the treatment effect of acupuncture, with patients reporting more severe pain at baseline experiencing more benefit from acupuncture compared to either sham-control or non-acupuncture control. Baseline psychological distress showed small treatment moderating effects, and results for sex were inconsistent. There was no strong evidence that age or duration of pain influenced the response to acupuncture. DISCUSSION: Of 5 patient characteristics tested, we found only baseline severity of pain to potentially moderate the effect of acupuncture treatment. For clinical practice, the evidence from this analysis does not justify stratifying chronic pain patients into subgroups that should or should not receive acupuncture on the basis of these 5 characteristics. Future acupuncture trials should assess other potentially important effect moderators.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid artery stenting is an alternative to endarterectomy for the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis but was associated with a higher risk of procedural stroke or death in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Technical aspects of treatment may partly explain these results. The purpose of this analysis was to investigate the influence of technical aspects such as stent design or the use of protection devices, as well as clinical variables, on procedural risk. METHODS: We pooled data of 1557 individual patients receiving stent treatment in three large RCTs comparing stenting versus endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis. The primary outcome event was any procedural stroke or death occurring within 30 days after stenting. RESULTS: Procedural stroke or death occurred significantly more often with the use of open-cell stents (61/595 patients, 10.3%) than with closed-cell stents (58/962 patients, 6.0%; RR 1.76; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.52; P=0.002). Procedural stroke or death occurred in 76/950 patients (8.0%) treated with protection devices (predominantly distal filters) and in 43/607 (7.1%) treated without protection devices (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.70; P=0.67). Clinical variables predicting the primary outcome event were age, severity of the qualifying event, history of prior stroke, and level of disability at baseline. The effect of stent design remained similar after adjustment for these variables. CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic carotid stenosis, the use of stents with a closed-cell design is independently associated with a lower risk of procedural stroke or death compared with open-cell stents. Filter-type protection devices do not appear to reduce procedural risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently published two independent randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, both indicating a >20% reduced risk of asthma/recurrent wheeze in the offspring by 3 years of age. However, neither reached statistical significance. OBJECTIVE: To perform a combined analysis of the two trials and investigate whether maternal 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) level at trial entry modified the intervention effect. METHODS: VDAART (N = 806) and COPSAC2010. (N = 581) randomized pregnant women to daily high-dose vitamin D3 (4,000 IU/d and 2,400 IU/d, respectively) or placebo. All women also received a prenatal vitamin containing 400 IU/d vitamin D3. The primary outcome was asthma/recurrent wheeze from 0-3yrs. Secondary end-points were specific IgE, total IgE, eczema and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). We conducted random effects combined analyses of the treatment effect, individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses, and analyses stratified by 25(OH)D level at study entry. RESULTS: The analysis showed a 25% reduced risk of asthma/recurrent wheeze at 0-3yrs: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.74 (95% CI, 0.57-0.96), p = 0.02. The effect was strongest among women with 25(OH)D level >/=30ng/ml at study entry: aOR = 0.54 (0.33-0.88), p = 0.01, whereas no significant effect was observed among women with 25(OH)D level <30ng/ml at study entry: aOR = 0.84 (0.62-1.15), p = 0.25. The IPD meta-analyses showed similar results. There was no effect on the secondary end-points. CONCLUSIONS: This combined analysis shows that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy results in a significant reduced risk of asthma/recurrent wheeze in the offspring, especially among women with 25(OH)D level >/= 30 ng/ml at randomization, where the risk was almost halved. Future studies should examine the possibility of raising 25(OH)D levels to at least 30 ng/ml early in pregnancy or using higher doses than used in our studies.

AB  - Over 50% of patients are already taking blood pressure-lowering therapy on hospital admission for acute stroke. An individual patient data meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials was undertaken to determine the effect of continuation versus temporarily stopping preexisting antihypertensive medication in acute stroke. Key databases were searched for trials against the following inclusion criteria: randomized design; stroke onset </=48 hours; investigating the effect of continuation versus stopping prestroke antihypertensive medication; and follow-up of >/=2 weeks. Two randomized controlled trials were identified and included in this meta-analysis of individual patient data from 2860 patients with </=48 hours of acute stroke. Risk of bias in each study was low. In adjusted logistic regression and multiple regression analyses (using random effects), we found no significant association between continuation of prestroke antihypertensive therapy (versus stopping) and risk of death or dependency at final follow-up: odds ratio 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.14). No significant associations were found between continuation (versus stopping) of therapy and secondary outcomes at final follow-up. Analyses for death and dependency in prespecified subgroups revealed no significant associations with continuation versus temporarily stopping therapy, with the exception of patients randomized </=12 hours, in whom a difference favoring stopping treatment met statistical significance. We found no significant benefit with continuation of antihypertensive treatment in the acute stroke period. Therefore, there is no urgency to administer preexisting antihypertensive therapy in the first few hours or days after stroke, unless indicated for other comorbid conditions.

AB  - Importance: The beneficial role of immunotherapy and the clinical relevance of current biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain inconclusive; thus, appropriate strategies and reliable predictors need further definition. Objectives: To evaluate the association of clinical outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors, tumor vaccines, and cellular immunotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and to explore appropriate strategies, candidates, and predictors. Data Sources: The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception to June 2018, using relevant search keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including tumor vaccine, cellular immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, programmed death-ligand 1, programmed death receptor 1, and non-small cell lung carcinoma. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, references, and conference proceedings were manually searched. Study Selection: English-language randomized clinical trials with available data that measured overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or objective response rate comparing immune checkpoint inhibitors, tumor vaccines, or cellular immunotherapy with conventional therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC were included. Thirty-one immunotherapy randomized clinical trials were included, and multicohort data included next-generation sequencing data from patients with advanced NCSLC. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were pooled to estimate the survival increases in OS and PFS. Dichotomous data, such as object response rate data, were analyzed using the risk ratio. Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model was used. I2 was used to assess the heterogeneity between trials; an I2 value exceeding 50% indicated the existence of substantial heterogeneity. Analyses took place from February 1, 2018, to August 31, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were OS and PFS. Results: In total, 14395 patients (9500 [66.0%] men) were included in the meta-analysis, and 1833 patients (mean [SD], 65.2 [9.9] years; 1063 [58.0%] men) were included in the individual patient-level study. Compared with conventional therapy, immunotherapy was associated with significantly longer OS (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.71-0.82; P < .001) and PFS (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70-0.83; P < .001). The best checkpoint blockade strategy was first-line pembrolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy. The combined predictive utility of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor mutation burden (TMB) was associated with predictive prognosis (whole-exome sequencing: 1-year PFS area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.829; 3-year PFS AUC, 0.839; targeted next-generation sequencing: 1-year PFS AUC, 0.826; 3-year PFS AUC, 0.948). Moreover, the addition of CD8+ T-cell tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was associated with improved prognosis predictions for OS (3-year OS AUC, 0.659; 5-year OS AUC, 0.665). RYR1 or MGAM mutations were significantly associated with concomitantly increased durable clinical benefits (RYR1: durable clinical benefit [DCB], 12 of 51 patients [24%]; no durable benefit [NDB], 2 of 55 patients [4%]; P < .001; MGAM: DCB, 12 of 51 patients [24%]; NDB, 0 patients; P < .001), a higher TMB (RYRI: high TMB, 12 of 53 patients [23%]; low TMB, 2 of 53 patients [38%]; P < .001; MGAM: high TMB, 9 of 53 patients [17%]; low TMB, 0 patients; P < .001), and higher PD-L1 expression (RYRI: high PD-L1 expression, 8 of 30 patients [27%]; low PD-L1 expression, 6 of 85 [7.1%]; P < .001; MGAM: high PD-L1 expression, 6 of 30 patients [20%]; low PD-L1 expression, 5 of 85 patients [6%]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Immunotherapies showed promising clinical outcomes for patients with NSCLC. Pembrolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy was found to be the most appropriate first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor regimen for advanced NSCLC, and the combined use of PD-L1 expression and TMB was found to be a promising biomarker to evaluate patients' survival and response to precision immunotherapy. The further combination of CD8+ T-cell tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, PD-L1 expression, and TMB was associated with reliable prognosis. The predictive value of that combination needs to be prospectively validated in large-scale studies.

AB  - A series of five randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) conducted between 2002 and 2015 support the potential efficacy of online family problem-solving treatment (OFPST) in improving both child and parent/family outcomes after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, small sample sizes and heterogeneity across individual studies have precluded examination of potentially important moderators. We jointly analyzed individual participant data (IPD) from these five RCTs, involving 359 children and adolescents between the ages of 5 and 18 years, to confirm the role of previously identified moderators (child's age and pre-treatment symptom levels, parental education) and to examine other potential moderators (race, sex, IQ), using IPD meta-analysis. This reanalysis revealed statistically strong evidence that parental education, child age at baseline, IQ, sex, and parental depression level pre-treatment moderated the effect of OFPST on various outcomes. In particular, children of parents with a less than high school education exhibited fewer internalizing problems and better social competence. Children injured at an older age exhibited fewer externalizing behaviors and less executive dysfunction following OFPST. Child IQ moderated the effect of OFPST on social competence, with significantly better competence for children with lower IQ who received OFPST. Lower levels of parental depression followed OFPST among subgroups with lower IQ, boys, and higher parental depression scores at baseline. Our findings indicate that the optimal application of OFPST is likely to involve older children, those with lower IQ scores, or those from families with lower socioeconomic status (SES).

AB  - Aims: To assess the effect of fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with contemporary drug-eluting stents on the composite of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (MI) vs. medical therapy in patients with stable coronary lesions. Methods and results: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) of the three available randomized trials of contemporary FFR-guided PCI vs. medical therapy for patients with stable coronary lesions: FAME 2 (NCT01132495), DANAMI-3-PRIMULTI (NCT01960933), and Compare-Acute (NCT01399736). FAME 2 enrolled patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), while the other two focused on non-culprit lesions in stabilized patients after acute coronary syndrome. A total of 2400 subjects were recruited from 54 sites world-wide with 1056 randomly assigned to FFR-guided PCI and 1344 to medical therapy. The pre-specified primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death or MI. We included data from extended follow-ups for FAME 2 (up to 5.5 years follow-up) and DANAMI-3-PRIMULTI (up to 4.7 years follow-up). After a median follow-up of 35 months (interquartile range 12-60 months), a reduction in the composite of cardiac death or MI was observed with FFR-guided PCI as compared with medical therapy (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.54-0.96; P = 0.02). The difference between groups was driven by MI. Conclusion: In this IPD meta-analysis of the three available randomized controlled trials to date, FFR-guided PCI resulted in a reduction of the composite of cardiac death or MI compared with medical therapy, which was driven by a decreased risk of MI.

AB  - Importance: Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) are rare but severe adverse reactions with high mortality. There is no evidence-based treatment, but various systemic immunomodulating therapies are used. Objectives: To provide an overview on possible immunomodulating treatments for SJS/TEN and estimate their effects on mortality compared with supportive care. Data Sources: A literature search was performed in December 2012 for articles published in MEDLINE, MEDLINE Daily, MEDLINE Inprocess, Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library (Central) from January 1990 through December 2012, and updated in December 2015, in the English, French, Spanish, and German languages looking for treatment proposals for SJS/TEN. Other sources were screened manually. Study Selection: Initially, 157 randomized and nonrandomized studies on therapies (systemic immunomodulating therapies or supportive care) for SJS/TEN were selected. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Relevant data were extracted from articles. Authors were contacted for further information. Finally, 96 studies with sufficient information regarding eligibility and adequate quality scores were considered in the data synthesis. All steps were performed independently by 2 investigators. Meta-analyses on aggregated study data (random-effects model) and individual patient data (IPD) (logistic regression adjusted for confounders) were performed to assess therapeutic efficacy. In the analysis of IPD, 2 regression models, stratified and unstratified by study, were fitted. Main Outcomes and Measures: Therapy effects on mortality were expressed in terms of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Results: Overall, 96 studies (3248 patients) were included. Applied therapies were supportive care or systemic immunomodulating therapies, including glucocorticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, cyclosporine, plasmapheresis, thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, hemoperfusion, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Glucocorticosteroids were associated with a survival benefit for patients in all 3 analyses but were statistically significant in only one (aggregated data: OR, 0.5; 95%% CI, 0.3-1.01; IPD, unstratified: OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.97; IPD, stratified: OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4-1.3). Despite the low patient size, cyclosporine was associated with a promising significant result in the only feasible analysis of IPD (unstratified model) (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-0.4). No beneficial findings were observed for other therapies, including intravenous immunoglobulins. Conclusions and Relevance: Although all analyses, including the unstratified model, had limitations, glucocorticosteroids and cyclosporine were the most promising systemic immunomodulating therapies for SJS/TEN. Further evaluation in prospective studies is required. However, this work provides a comprehensive overview on proposed systemic immunomodulating treatments for SJS/TEN, which is of great relevance for treating physicians.

AB  - Importance: Placebo effects reduce pain and contribute to clinical analgesia, but after decades of research, it remains unclear whether placebo treatments mainly affect nociceptive processes or other processes associated with pain evaluation. Objective: We conducted a systematic, participant-level meta-analysis to test the effect of placebo treatments on pain-associated functional neuroimaging responses in the neurologic pain signature (NPS), a multivariate brain pattern tracking nociceptive pain. Data Sources: Medline (PubMed) was searched from inception to May 2015; the search was augmented with results from previous meta-analyses and expert recommendations. Study Selection: Eligible studies were original investigations that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals and that involved functional neuroimaging of the human brain with evoked pain delivered under stimulus intensity-matched placebo and control conditions. The authors of all eligible studies were contacted and asked to provide single-participant data. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were collected between December 2015 and November 2017 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of individual participant data guidelines. Results were summarized across participants and studies in a random-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main, a priori outcome was NPS response; pain reports were assessed as a secondary outcome. Results: We obtained data from 20 of 28 identified eligible studies, resulting in a total sample size of 603 healthy individuals. The NPS responses to painful stimulation compared with baseline conditions were positive in 575 participants (95.4%), with a very large effect size (g = 2.30 [95% CI, 1.92 to 2.69]), confirming its sensitivity to nociceptive pain in this sample. Placebo treatments showed significant behavioral outcomes on pain ratings in 17 of 20 studies (85%) and in the combined sample (g = -0.66 [95% CI, -0.80 to -0.53]). However, placebo effects on the NPS response were significant in only 3 of 20 studies (15%) and were very small in the combined sample (g = -0.08 [95% CI, -0.15 to -0.01]). Similarly, analyses restricted to studies with low risk of bias (g = -0.07 [95% CI, -0.15 to 0.00]) indicated very small effects, and analyses of just placebo responders (g = -0.22 [95% CI, -0.34 to -0.11]) indicated small effects, as well. Conclusions and Relevance: Placebo treatments have moderate analgesic effects on pain reports. The very small effects on NPS, a validated measure that tracks levels of nociceptive pain, indicate that placebo treatments affect pain via brain mechanisms largely independent of effects on bottom-up nociceptive processing.
